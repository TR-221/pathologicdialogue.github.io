# pathologicdialogue.github.io

This fork contains two scripts designed to extract data from HTML files and transform it into a hierarchical, tree-like structure. This structure is then outputed in a simplified, plain text format.
The full version of the output details all possible dialogue paths and choices:
```
********************
TREE 1 - BRANCH 1
Hero and Character
********************
┏━━ [№01-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃   ├── [№02-h01-ID] Hero: reply...
┃   │   └── [№03-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃   │       ├── [№04-p01-ID] (↓) Hero: reply, leads to the same line...
┃   │       └── [№04-p02-ID] (↓) Hero: reply, leads to the same line...
┃   │           └── [№05-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃   │               ├── [№06-p01-ID] (X) Hero: reply, ends the dialogue...
┃   │               └── [№06-p02-ID] (X) Hero: reply, ends the dialogue...
┃   └── [№02-h02-ID] Hero: reply...
┃       └── [№03-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃           └── [№04-h01-ID] Hero: reply...
┃               └── [№05-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃                   ├── [№06-p01-ID] (↓) Hero: reply, leads to the same line...
┃                   └── [№06-p02-ID] (↓) Hero: reply, leads to the same line...
┃                       └── [№07-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃                           ├── [№08-p01-ID] (X) Hero: reply, ends the dialogue...
┗━━                         └── [№08-p02-ID] (X) Hero: reply, ends the dialogue...
```
The path descends recursively through the HTML structure, selecting a single `<h1>` or `<p1>` tag at each level until it encounters a childless `<h1>` or `<p>` tag. This generates a single dialogue path:
```
********************
TREE 1 - BRANCH 1
Hero and Character
********************
┏━━ [№01-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃   └── [№02-h02-ID] Hero: reply...
┃       └── [№03-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃           └── [№04-h01-ID] Hero: reply...
┃               └── [№05-h01-ID] Character: line...
┃                   └── [№06-p01-ID] Hero: reply...
┃                       └── [№07-h01-ID] Character: line...
┗━━                         └── [№08-p02-ID] (X) Hero: reply, ends the dialogue...
```
The scripts must be located within the same directory as the target HTML files.
