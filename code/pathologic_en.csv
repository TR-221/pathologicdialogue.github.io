502850, "We need to plan the battle in advance. 'The battle' being the task that lies ahead of us. I will not give up without a fight, even if everyone else has come to terms with their own mortality. We need to join our forces, Bachelor, and combine our diverse skills./n/nOur enemy is invisible, ubiquitous, dissolved into the very things that we will need to purify. The enemy seems invulnerable, but it is not imperceptible, and whatever terror it instills in us is explained simply by our lack of knowledge. If we are to destroy the enemy, we need to study it first. For this, we need to capture it. This is our first and foremost priority./n/nPlease forgive my reiteration of self-evident things like these. My only reason for spelling it all out is to better understand it myself./n/nOur goals are not quite the same. I strive to save as many lives as possible, whereas your purpose is to put an end to the outbreak. I've been told of your abiding desire to uncover the truth. I would gladly help you with that, if you will help me achieve my goal. Together, we can eradicate the disease, and save everything that might still be saved./n/nStakh Rubin/n/nP.S.

But our impresario is convinced that it's for the best-after all, The Fatal Loss is as tragic a play as it gets.

502920, "Seems like your troupe is about to become very wealthy very soon."

Where was I? Ah yes! This tragedy is a mime performance that's become somewhat of a ritual for us. It's the only play we stage. The author remains unknown, although legend has it that they were of divine nature..."

502934, "You still haven't told me about the story."
502935, "The story's all around you, Bachelor! Just look how tragic the tragedy that's unfolding in the town is! That's just additional proof to the truthfulness of our esteemed impresario's words: a play is performed onstage-but it's executed in real life..."
502936, "Fine. I'll talk to Immortell about it."

Throughout all the years The Loss has been on stage, it's been accompanied by a chain of mysterious coincidences.

Some saw me as a rambling bedlamite, some as a heartless thrill-seeker, a ruthless careerist who would stop at nothing and stoop to anything. For them, whatever research I would take on was but a piece of opportunistic buffoonery, that succeeds only in travestying the very purpose of scientific knowledge./n/nLet them gossip all they like. None of them will have the temerity to say I ever went against my own principles! Let them keep a list of my most outrageous blasphemies; all I do serves one single master, and the name of this master is Truth./n/nThey have trapped me now, they think. I was brought to a battle of a kind that only a victor may survive. I was posed against a riddle that I will not leave unsolved. I'd rather die than give in./n/nMy reason for being here is to put an end to the outbreak. To do so I must learn everything there is to know about this unfamiliar disease; to reach a conclusion on how it may be counteracted. Then I should present my findings to the Inquisitor who will mobilise their authority to prevent the disaster./n/nThis is what is expected of me. And, rest assured, this is what they're going to get."
503075, "It is no longer evident what the Powers That Be are waiting for. What is abundantly clear, however, is that they are equally as mendacious as they are unmerciful. Do they intend to preserve this chimera of a town? Of course they do. Are they determined to put an end to the outbreak? The devil himself wouldn't know the answer to that. Would they be pleased by the news of Bachelor Dankovsky's death? Beyond question, they would./n/nHaving said that, now is not the time to give up. It is fortunate that they didn't dispatch the barbarous Karminsky here, and a different Inquisitor arrived instead. It is even better that this new Inquisitor is alike me in some respects. Essentially, we are locked inside the same cage./n/nAglaya Lilich told me she was going to help. Her plan will allow me to keep my word; to carry out my orders to the letter and in so doing to destroy the very core of what the Powers That Be have planned. They will plunge into their own pitfall and reap the consequences of their deception./n/nWhat we must do, then, is to find out which part of the town the source of the infection is nested in and reduce the whole area to rubble. By these means, the expansion of the disease will come to a halt."
503076, "You may have thought, at some point, that she was your most reliable ally. Why wouldn't she be? Her troubles, you thought, were so much like your own. Just like you, she fell victim to this perpetual confrontation between those who have their honour intact and those who have none at all./n/nProud like you; astute like you and no less devoted to the relentless pursuit of Truth. These were the feeble assurances you used to comfort yourself with, until the very moment you could no longer deny her betrayal. The Truth that she has placed so helpfully for you to stumble upon has proven to be nothing but lies; deception fed by decades of hatred and an abiding desire for vengeance. The solution was an intricately composed hoax./n/nScheming wench! Knowing all too well that she would not be able to bribe you, or to trick the Commander, she has contrived to control him by your words instead of her own. She aimed his guns with your hands while she herself remained hidden. This is what Inquisitors do.

503219, "I'm not bloodthirsty, and I don't like making noise."
503220, "I'd rather cooperate with this curious specimen. Why burn her-on the spot, at least?"
503223, "PEANUT. An earth-nut. Occupies the lowest tier in the hierarchy of the children's game of nuts. It has little value because of its fragile shell and awkward shape. However, it is often found in food stockpiles and has some nutritional value. Can never be infected."
503224, "ARMY BOOTS. Protect the feet and lower legs from both infection and wounds, including stab wounds. Make it safe to walk over burning coals and sharp objects such as nails."
503225, "ARMY GLOVES. Strong army-issue gloves. The fingertips and striking surfaces are reinforced with leather inserts. The fabric is an excellent repellent. They protect the hands, wrists, and forearms from contact with infected surfaces, as well as from burns and wounds."
503226, "OVERALLS. Army-issue sanitary overalls. An excellent repellent. Protects the torso, hands, legs, and head from accidental contact with infected surfaces. The durable material of the overalls protects from stab wounds and burns. Its camouflage colouring makes it difficult to target the wearer with a firearm."
503227, "WHITE VACCINE. The final variant of the 'organic vaccine'. A unique prophylactic drug based on a live culture of the Sand Plague. Even if one's immunity is completely suppressed by the infection, given a safe environment it will be restored in 25 minutes. Maintains one's immunity in infected districts for four hours."
503229, "BANDAGE. An elastic antiseptic bandage. Facilitates recovery after a traumatic injury. Closes and disinfects the wound, preventing inflammation."
503231, "BLACK VACCINE. An early sample of the 'organic vaccine' A makeshift prophylactic drug based on a dead culture of the Sand Plague. Allegedly restores one's immunity over the course of several hours."
503233, "DRAPERY. A piece of light fabric (a sheet, a tablecloth, or a cotton curtain). Used for moving around in infected areas in order to prevent accidental tactile contact with infected particles and surfaces. As a single-use item, it's usually thrown away before entering a building."
503235, "ETORPHINE. A powerful narcotic painkiller. It's very good at reducing pain and has a similarly strong sedative effect (35s, -35e). Restores strength when sleeping (3e/ph, 3s/ph). It should be remembered that an overdose can lead to a severely weakened state and even death. Effective for ten hours."
503237, "FEROMYCINUM. An antibiotic that kills microbes and suppreses their growth. Feromycinum causes a sharp decrease in the number of harmful microorganisms and halves an infection's rate of progression.  It does not eradicate the disease, but can significantly lower the level of infection and even return the patient to consciousness. Is very harmful to health."
503238, "HAZELNUT. A tree nut. These nuts don't grow in our region, but are often found in the town because of the children's favourite game of nuts. It's rumoured that there used to be a large stockpile of tree nuts in Warehouse 11 and Notkin's friends made off with four sacks. Can never be infected."
503239, "WALNUT. A rare nut for this area. Knowing the children's love for large nuts, the adults would use it as a reward. Now walnuts have become something akin to a currency among children. One could exchange a large walnut for something valuable. Can never be infected."
503240, "SMOKED MEAT. This meat was cooked a month ago. Very nutritious and filling. Is very popular among townsfolk and thus relatively hard to come by nowadays."
503242, "LEMON. Citrus medica, a common lemon. They're shipped to the region via the South-Western Railroad. A highly valuable fruit. Provides a rich supply of vitamins and reduces fatigue, but increases hunger. Increases immuntiy by a negligible amount. Lemons are considered a rarity in the region."
503243, "LENS. Lenses like this can be set into an optical apparatus and used to identify dense clusters of infected particles. Different lens sets allow for early detection and identification of different types of infected clusters."
503244, "PROTECTIVE MASK. An antibacterial mask. Reduces the chance of accidental infection, especially from conversation with an infected person. It is recommended to regularly change the mask. A used mask cannot be re-sterilized."
503245, "MERADORM. A painkiller (-25e) rather than a sleeping draught. Restores a small amount of health (3s). Good for restoring strength during sleep (5e/ph, 8s/ph). Meradorm has a strong sedative effect and induces sleep even during excruciating pain. The effect lasts for 5 hours."
503246, "MILK. A bottle of cow's milk. Be careful with this product! Milk is very good for one's health but its origin means there is always a big risk. Women say that recently cows have been producing a clear ichor, and dark clots have been found in steamed milk. Farm animals cannot be trusted these days."
503247, "MONOMYCINUM. An antibiotic that kills microbes in the organism and suppresses their growth. Monomycinum doesn't kill harmful microorganisms, but strongly impedes their reproduction which is crucial for this type of infection. Unable to destroy the disease but can reduce the rate of infection to a third. Significantly harmful to health."
503248, "MORPHINE. A universal opiate painkiller. Has a strong analgesic (15s) and sedative (-25e) effect. Used for heavy injuries, acute pain and in preparation for surgery. Reduces fatigue (8e/ph) and increases health (2s/ph) when sleeping. The effect lasts for 10 hours."

503251, "NEOMYCINUM. An antibiotic that kills microbes in the organism and suppresses their growth. Neomycinum slightly decreases the number of harmful microorganisms but does not slow down the rate of infection. Unable to destroy the disease, but can halve the level of infection. Slightly harmful to health."
503252, "NOVOCAINE. Has an equal analgesic and sedative effect (10s, -10e). Provides excellent restoration of strength when sleeping (8e/ph, 13s/ph). A good local anesthetic. The effect lasts for 9 hours."
503253, "DISPOSABLE GLOVES. Decrease the chance of accidental infection, especially when handling infected bodies. It is recommended to change gloves regularly. Cannot be re-sterilized."
503254, "HEART. A human heart. Extracting organs from a human body is seen as a horrible blasphemy in the local tribal community. Only the menkhu are allowed to do this because they have an ancestral right to cut living bodies. However, some gatherers and also the Hunchback from the Atrium district would be willing to trade for something this rare..."
503255, "LOCKPICK. A homemade disposable lockpick. Such lockpicks can be used to open simple locks on the doors of typical houses."
503256, "VEGETABLES. Preserved vegetables. The jars are, as you can see, not labelled. At the warehouses the jars were packed together in crates, preventing a mixup. But this is stolen goods. This jar could contain tomatoes, young onion bulbs, peppers, or beans. All are good for one's health in different measure."
503257, "BLOOD. Human blood. Extracting organs from a human body is seen as a horrible blasphemy in the local tribal community. Only the menkhu are allowed to do this because they have an ancestral right to cut living bodies. However, some gatherers and also the Hunchback from the Atrium district would be willing to trade for something this rare..."

503259, "BANDAGE SET. A set of bandaging equipment-bandages, tourniquets, splints, and antiseptics. Very useful for recovery after a traumatic injury. Allows to stop bleeding, disinfect wounds, support injured joints and damaged tissue."
503261, "EXECUTOR'S CLOAK. Part of a theatre costume. Worn nowadays by 'deathbringers'-corpse carriers, undertakers, watchers, and others who handle dirty work. The cloak draws attention but removes any desire to talk with its wearer."
503262, "REPELLENT CAPE. A light cape made of synthetic material that serves as a good repellent. Protects the torso from accidental contact with infected surfaces. Provides moderate protection from fire. It's believed that the muted coloring of the cape makes the wearer a difficult target for firearms."
503263, "REPELLENT ANKLE BOOTS. Short boots. The material is a good repellent. Protect the feet and ankles from contact with infected surfaces. Provide no protection against blows and rat bites."
503264, "'SHMOWDER'. A mix of randomly chosen drugs (mostly antibiotics). Those 'shmowders' were created by children to 'play Plague'. The random recipe produced an unexpected result-the powder completely removes the effects of Sand Plague infection, but severely damages health."
503265, "TEST-TUBE. A small glass flask."
503266, "TALON MASK. A theatrical mask shaped like a bird's head. Stands for 'deception' and 'traps' in mime performances. Such masks are worn by those who wish to remain incognito. Executors put aromatic antiseptics inside the beak. Provides no protection from infection."
503267, "REPELLENT JACKBOOTS. Strong tall jackboots. The material is a good repellent. Protect the legs and ankles from contact with infected surfaces. Provide little protection against blows and dog bites for the lower legs and ankles."
503269, "SYRINGE. An old-fashioned syringe used for injections. It looks to be in need of sterilization."
503270, "BLUE VACCINE. An enhanced variant of the 'organic vaccine'. A prophylactic drug based on a weakened culture of the Sand Plague. Tested by volunteers and judged to be suited for distribution. Restores immunity for 4 hours, rendering a person almost completely insusceptible to the effects of the disease."
503273, "CRACKER. A piece of dried bread. Not very nutritious, but can be stored for a long time. The town doesn't have a bakery. The townsfolk bake their own bread, while the dwellers of the Termitary make unleavened cakes. Lately there hasn't been any fresh bread because of flour shortages."
503274, "FRESH FISH. This fish was caught today or yesterday. This indicates there is still live fish in the river, which inspires hope. Contains a lot of phosphorus and other useful nutrients. Some believe that consumption of fish stimulates the brain significantly."
503275, "FRESH MEAT. The meat of an animal slaughtered hours ago. Nobody knows where this came from. The situation in the Abattoir is unknown, its innards are closed off to common people, and any contact with the Termitary is temporarily cut off. In any case, fresh meat is nutritious and tasty if properly cooked."
503276, "PANACEA. An organic serum based on antibodies that Artemy Burakh managed to procure from some mysterious source. Completely eradicates the effects of the infection at any stage. Is not harmful. Only a few portions exist in the town. Probably no more than a dozen."
503277, "ALPHA-TABLETS. An outdated immunity booster. Only useful in very large doses that cause serious health damage."
503278, "BETA-TABLETS. A synthetic immunity booster. Good for increasing immunity. Overdosing can lead to adverse health effects."
503279, "GAMMA-TABLETS. New-generation immunity booster. Excellent for increasing immunity. Speeds up white blood cell production. Can be dangerous in large doses."
503280, "DELTA-TABLETS. An immunity booster. A masterpiece of this country's pharmacology. Increases immunity by a great deal. Large doses cause negligible harm."
503282, "TWYRINE. A strong infusion of the oxitocia tvirinum herb. Boosts immunity. Acts as an analgesic, restores strength during sleep. According to elder locals, critical doses of twyrine can alter the effects of infection. Some of the effects of twyrine are still unknown."
503283, "WATER. A bottle of spring water from one of the hidden springs-the Cathedral's Stone spring; the Spin-a-Yarn Square well, or the Sugagh Khadugh spring on the boundary between the Steppe and the Rotten Field. The water from the latter used to be sacred, but the locals are wary about drinking it due to its proximity to burial grounds."
503284, "DRIED FISH. The river has provided quite a few unpleasant surprises recently. Could this indicate a mass dying off of fish? Hundreds of dead fish have washed up during the past week, the banks are covered in scales. This has made the people wary of eating fresh fish and they now prefer preserved fish like this one."
503285, "DRIED MEAT. This meat was cooked three weeks ago. The risk of it being infected is negligible, but it is still the meat of a Steppe animal... Large shipments of dried meat have been prepared for transportation to the regional center and await the arrival of the freight train at the Beef Warehouses."
503286, "EGG. A fresh quail egg. Very nutritious. Especially good for an organism weakened by a serious illness. Chickens and chicken eggs are becoming rare nowadays, so the townspeople are eating quail eggs."

503291, "She was staying with the Saburov family first, but then they presented her with her own house. She is too afraid to stay there alone, though. Instead, the girl keeps hiding in the foulest slums this town has to offer. Apparently, the disease does nothing to her."
503292, "Those are sinister signs. And do you not want to catch her? "

503571, "Sure, go ahead. Where to start? Perhaps the examination of the suspects would help?"
503572, "Of course it will! Here's how it goes: you gather all the ladies that you find disconcerting in the Cathedral-it won't be hard seeing how it's empty now. You light up a huge fire by the entrance. Then you make them strip naked and begin the very thorough examination... looking for the sharp protrusions from beneath the skin. You don't find any, of course. Then..."

503574, "Blood is unnecessary. Look for the teeth. So do you want to hear the rest or not? Anyway, sooner or later one of them will break, unable to endure it any longer, and make a dash for it in tears. Straight into the fire, of course. And that's when her true nature will become apparent! She'll turn all black, she'll howl and wail, her fingers will become crooked... It'll be pretty obvious then that she's no human!"

You should be stripping them naked-even that would allow you catch a more faithful glimpse of reality than those lenses of yours. Tried and true! Or... Oh, it just dawned on me! Perhaps this is it? Perhaps you're so angry because you don't get enough female attention?"

503644, "It could have been worse. What we're dealing with is a bacterium of a very distinctive type-although I have to admit I've never seen anything like it. It propagates extremely quickly; it's truly unbelievable. However, I have a theory already... "
503645, "A disgusting worm with a horned head and a cluster of long, clawed feelers. There is a characteristic heaviness at the bottom of its body. When dormant, it resembles a woman in a wedding gown... I'm kidding, I'm kidding. It looks nothing like that."
503646, "What kind of theory?"
503647, "A bacterium of this kind could only emerge in a very specific environment... So I suspect that all cases we're dealing with have to have a common source. I so much hope it's true! If this source of infection is eradicated, the outbreak will cease."

503652, "Why?"
503653, "The bacteria that have already escaped into the open will expire very soon-they can't survive without living blood. And, whenever they find blood, they immediately deplete it-to consequently perish like fish out of water."
503654, "So, what do you have in mind? "
503655, "Everything happens for a reason. There is always just one single detail, one source from which fateful consequences emerge. Remove the source... and the balance will be reestablished. Who knows; a single butterfly, crushed, miles away, may be what it takes for the town to survive. There must always be a cause to everything, you see..."

503657, "An infection like this can only be spread by a living being, in whose blood the bacteria procreate at an insane rate. I don't believe that the host realizes that at all. Make note of how the disease behaves. It burns bright... and then it burns out very quickly."
503658, "Well, this leads us to a very simple conclusion: find the guilty party and burn them. Then, the age of blissful serenity will come down upon us."
503659, "If only it was so simple... "

503675, "Well, not necessarily. But if I do, no one would dare lay a finger on my Thanatica-the Powers That Be gave me their word. And it's entirely possible that my victory award would be a discovery that'll prolong human life from 60-70 years to a hundred."
503676, "Not necessarily. I just have to pass over the data I've managed to collect to him, that's all."
503677, "Well, you're almost done, aren't you? You've figured out how to crush it, haven't you? You've estimated and calculated the requirements... haven't you?"
503678, "I have. The only thing left for me is figuring out where it's creeping from-and then let the Inquisitor deal with the source. Let him organize the mass production of my vaccine. Let him establish order and do his best to avoid more deaths. As for me, I'll leave the place."

503858, "No. Ask the overseers... they can describe the situation in more detail... those of them who survived, I mean... most of them have died trying to put this fire out. Although they say that... promise not to get angry?"
503859, "Is it likely to make me angry?"
503860, "Do you think this is funny?"
503861, "I'm too exhausted to."
503862, "They say a mara sneaked into the Cathedral last night. They saw a long-armed woman wrapped in woolen rags shamble about the Cathedral, stroking the walls with her hands..."
503863, "That must have been some poor deranged woman."
503864, "Were you an overseer last night? "
503865, "So? Some beggar was looking for shelter at the Cathedral. What does it have to do with mara?"
503866, "And then she appeared inside the Cathedral-out of thin air, just like that. She was still wearing the rags... bits and pieces of them tore away when she began to descend. She was waving her arms, sprinkling something over the people. They said it resembled salty rain..."
503867, "I need to interrogate the survivors. "
503868, "Calm down. I think I should indeed talk to the overseers..."
503912, ""
503913, "Well... I had a dream that it was raining inside. I was lying on the floor, all curled up, nestling by my shivering fellow men and women... And then heavy, salty drops started falling upon my lips and eyelids! And I saw water gushing from the vaulted ceiling!"
503914, "A sinister dream. Let us hope it's not prophetic. "
503915, "Was there anything else?"
503916, "Well...  It felt like a nightmare, but a nightmare that's about to end... But yeah, I mean, the dream was really scary. Water bleeding through the Cathedral roof... Come to think of it, it wasn't raining at all; it rather seemed as though the Cathedral was standing underwater and then the roof gave in... I only see nightmares, you know!"
503917, "What was the ending to all this?"
503918, "Hmm. This is a rather spot-on image of an isolation ward... A curious thing to imagine."
503919, "Eh... I can't remember... Everything was about to come crumbling down, but I can't say I was all that frightened. And the people around me didn't move at all. Like they didn't care anymore! "
503920, "I can't say I care for the hopeless in your voice. Victory is already at hand. "
503921, "Don't put too much stock in nightmares. Everything will be fine. "
503925, ""
503926, "The suspect is a noble young lady! What if someone points the persecutors in my direction?"
503927, "Why would anyone do that? "
503928, "Everybody knows how enamoured of the Cathedral I am. People know I come there often. There already is a strong connection between this building and me in the minds of the locals, so I'm pretty sure they will want to drag me into this... I'm not an especially noble person, but I'm well-known. People know... and even love me. "
503929, "What happened?"
503930, "Tonight an unknown young woman got into the Cathedral. She walked among the sleeping and kissed their lips. Her face was hidden under a hood, and her body was wrapped in a loose-fitting cloak. Still, when she bent down to the sleeping, someone recognized familiar features."
503931, "And so you are a suspect?"
503932, "Who was it? "
503933, "I should go there immediately. Farewell, Eva. "
503937, "How does the matter of nobility even come into question? Does it mean the suspect has been identified? "
503938, "If they love you, that means you're in no danger."
503939, "That matter remains mysterious. Maria believes she was recognized, but the people there refused to call her by name to protect her from imminent punishment. There are few women in our town that would be sacrificed life and soul for. Those who worship them so much could offer her shelter... out of love. "
503940, "So you are a woman worthy of sacrificing life and soul for?"
503941, "Were all witnesses men? "
503942, "I'll talk to Maria. "
503943, "Everyone who was still able to speak. Agony spread like fire among them. You should talk to the overseers, it was them who took care of the infected. "
503944, "Yes, I suppose so. "
503945, "Don't worry. Nobody will lay a finger on you without my permission. "
503946, "I don't know... I doubt that. Nevertheless, I'm afraid. Someone whispered by my windows at night, pressed their faces to the glass, and peeked inside. I was very scared, but I forbade myself from turning the lights on."
503947, "That was wise."
503948, "Disasters make people go mental. Do keep your eyes open."
503949, ""
503950, "She was offering something to drink. That I'm certain of. There was no water, so they accepted hers-well, whatever she was cupping in her hands. She must have accidentally grabbed putrid water. I bet there was no foul intent."
503951, "Who are you talking about? "
503952, "I've checked the river water. It's dirty and undrinkable, but it's not infected."
503953, "The girl... She took pity on the Cathedral sods, sneaked in to get to them, and gave them something to drink. I mean, they were all crammed together in darkness, it must've been torture."
503954, "What happened in the Cathedral? "
503955, "Haven't you heard? What the hell are you doing here then? Go there! I'm not gonna retell someone else's tale to you. 'Tis a disaster, doc... On the other hand, 'tis not a doctor that they need right now, but an undertaker."
503956, "No way..."
503957, "What girl?"
503958, "Ain't our business who or what that girl is; you're the guy in charge, so 'tis up to you. I ain't no girl judge, you figure that one out yourself. But she was nice. A kind spirit."
503959, "Cut this rubbish, kind sir."

503961, "I've heard already. "
503962, ""
503963, "Man oh man... Thank God my mom and I never went into that nailed coffin! Auntie almost talked us into it, can you believe that?"
503964, "What coffin?"
503965, "Pardon me, girl, I don't have the time."
503966, "Last night Eva fed salt water to the people in the Cathedral! Everyone who drank it, died. Those who didn't, got infected and died too. And those who tried to escape the place and run away weren't allowed to because it's forbidden."
503967, "Eva? "
503968, "What are you talking about?"
503969, "It's not just me, everyone's talking. Ask around in the Cathedral. Although... hold on, don't go in there. Go to the hospital, that's where everyone's been brought. Either there or six feet under. Mom saw the carts with her own eyes."
503970, "Or Yulia. All in all, it's either Anna or Lara. Some lady that was allowed into the Cathedral. "
503971, "Bloody hell..."
503972, "How do you know that?"
503973, "Wouldn't you like to know! Ask around, if you're so smart. "
503974, "Well, no point in talking to you..."
503975, "Watch your tongue, girl! "
503976, "Nonsense."

503981, "I just think so. "
503982, "Don't run around alone. "
503983, "The holy tears. They were raining from above because everyone died in the Cathedral. It was a higher kind of mourning."
503984, "Who told you that? You couldn't have made that up yourself... could you?"
503985, "Everyone says so. And my granny. "
503986, "Don't play here unsupervised."
503987, "Nonsense."
503988, ""
503989, "Dirty lies, all of it! Let me tell you, that salty liquid was neither water nor tears. The foul maneater sprinkled people's lips with blood, that's what she did. Notkin told me that in the age of the Blind Aurochs' Skin, there used to be a rite that worked just like that."
503990, "What?!"
503991, "What do you mean?"
503992, "Well, it's a very lackluster hunt-consider the culprit already found. The Cathedral guards were bribed by one of ladies of particular notoriety-so it was she that did the whole thing, that's clear as day. Crept into the Cathedral naked, with just a cloak on, and sprayed the beds with rat blood! That was her plan-that the half-awake people wouldn't be able to realize what's going on in their sleepy confusion."
503993, "What happened here? "
503994, "It happened at night. They woke up in the morning to find out that there were only two types of people in the Cathedral, the dead and the soon-to-be. Tried to force the doors-both the lucky and the not so much-but no can do. No unauthorized exit! And here you go, five hundred stiffs. Thankfully, at least none of our guys were inside when that happened. Those dumbheads."
503995, "Watch your tongue, you brat! "
503996, "It's horrible. "
503997, "Ever seen blood? Warm, salty, infected-that's what it was like. Do I have to spell it out for you or what? The only upside is that the witch's been seen. Now we're onto her. "
503998, "I wonder how you're goinf to catch her."
503999, "What, did the plague infiltrate the Cathedral? "
504000, ""
504001, "I, for one, do not believe that Cathedral girl was a mara... I think her intentions were good. They ran out of food and water by that time; she must have been trying to feed the weakest. Perhaps there was something on her clothes. Or perhaps it wasn't her at all?"
504002, "What Cathedral girl?"
504003, "The isolation ward had enough water when I checked on it last. The food was supposed to be delivered by morning."
504004, "Some girl or lady infiltrated the Cathedral at night. I've heard people say that she descended from above, but I think she must've slipped through the entrance. Having tricked the guards, I mean... The poor thing must've been so scared... And see how that turned out."
504005, "And how did it...?"
504006, "Didn't I tell you to guard the Cathedral extremely vigilantly? To not-under any bloody circumstances!-let anyone in or out? You people... are absolutely impossible!"
504007, "Haven't you been told, doctor? Hurry up then, perhaps there is still a chance that you might save someone. They've all died during the night, and those who haven't are passing on now... Perhaps you can still do something."
504008, "There is only one remedy for that,"
504009, "I have been told. I'm just figuring out the details."

504020, "Sometimes ghosts spirit children away from their very cradles. They say it happened to a family of my neighbours; a herdsman's daughter have been hiding hooves under her dress for three years straight. A shabnak had killed her and put her white skin on; he wanted to get to the pots with fresh milk. If it's my sister, then she must be a turnskin or a changeling."
504021, "Enough. We've already had one witch hunt. "
504022, "That was a blind hunt-but now there are all kinds of signs and assorted signals. I've always known there's an evil spirit walking among us. Someone simply has to be guilty. All we have to do is kill the guitly person-and it will all be fine!"
504023, "Nonsense. "

The examination of Simon Kain-who is rumoured to be a man of incredible longevity-may shake the very foundation of modern thanatology and challenge the existent notions of death itself./n/nHowever, even if this undying leviathan proves to be more than a fairy tale, the mere confirmation of his existence won't suffice to prevent the powers that be from shutting our laboratory down./n/nI need to figure out the most fruitful approach. Simon is a well respected man and if he mistakes my interest for effrontery it would be nigh impossible to convince him to help me break new ground in the field of human vitality."

504496, "Did the sounds from the outside wake you up too? There was a terrible groan... And then something snapped loudly..."
504497, "Okay, I'll come back."
504502, "Are you willing to trade the company of a fascinated woman for that of a dreadful old man, even if he is a sorcerer? That's so sad... But Simon won't go anywhere. He is; he has always been; he always will be-even if the moon were to fall to the ground. Please, stay with me a little longer."
504504, "Are you in that much of a hurry? Do come round, the Kains are asleep now. Take your knockabout coat off. Have a rest in my bed. Let me warm your hands. You are so anxious to see Simon, as though your life depended on it."
504505, "My life... yes. Now that my laboratory is on the brink of destruction, my whole life's pursuit depends on that remarkable man. If he has really managed to live that long, then his tissues will help me defeat death."
504506, "Death... So that's the enemy you've chosen for yourself. Isn't it hard? I don't think anyone has managed to defeat that evil yet."
504507, "Millions of doctors defeated it on certain singular occasions; but my enemy is more fearsome. It is Death itself rather than a singular case of death."
504508, "I don't understand..."
504509, "I can barely understand it myself. Could death only seem inevitable to us, but in reality be nothing more than a whim of the will that had shaped this world? That is the question. So where is the key to my victory?"
504510, "Go... And I'll prepare everything for your return. Do come back after you speak to the Kains! They will probably do a lot of things that will puzzle you and put you on guard. I will have some advice that may be of help to you... if you need it."
504512, "I'm unlikely to stay here for long, Eva. I will depart after speaking to Simon-with or without him."
504513, "Show me where Simon lives."
504514, "My enemy is inevitability. I am challenging the forces of nature."

504517, "How do you know who I am?"
504518, "Glory is the messenger riding ahead of the man. A celebrity from the Capital! Bachelor Dankovsky, the founder of Thanatica. The man who challenges death. Of course we've heard about you."

504850, "I have been told of your initial verdict. You assert that Simon Kain was not killed by a human or a shabnak demon, but died of a natural cause, or succumbed to some physical sickness. Is that what you are saying?"
504857, "I don't know for how long you will have to remain here, doctor. You are most welcome to be my guest, even though I won't  try to keep you... While you are here, though, and especially since you are trying to find out the truth, it is my duty to offer you a piece of advice."
504858, "I would be most grateful for it."
504862, "We have sent for Isidor Burakh's most accomplished apprentice. His name is Stanislav Rubin. Quite a resolute and talented man this Rubin is. I have great expectations of him. He will bring everything you need and you will examine the body together."
504863, "I am no pathologist, and autopsy is not my specialty, but I could perform a preliminary examination."
504864, "I am genuinely sorry, doctor, but our family traditions were cherished for as long as the family has existed. One of such traditions requests the dead to be left alone for twenty-four hours. The body is not to be seen or touched by anyone. This period of deferral will be over by tomorrow."
504865, "A curious tradition. Where does it come from?"
504866, "On several occasions excessive haste has led to undesirable consequences. The phenomenon that Isidor had invited you here to study... it is in our blood. This physiological trait of our family shows itself from time to time."
504867, "That is quite intriguing."
504868, "The examination of the body will not help you in any way. This puzzle has to be solved within your mind. I am not able to, or even allowed to tell you any more than that. Believe me, I am not trying to conceal any evidence from you. The body is kept in the ice-house. It is intact. But Focus may not be breached."
504869, "I will wait for the required period of time to pass."
504870, "Please take all possible measures to ensure the safety of the body."
504871, "I'm afraid I must insist."
504872, "I might have agreed to break the tradition, which is as sacred to us as it is meaningful and reasonable, but I am entirely convinced that there is no valuable information at all for you to derive from the examination of the body. I am sorry, but no exception can be made here; not even for you."
504873, "Reasonable? So it has a practical justification?"
504874, "I understand. I cannot insist further."
504875, "All right. Let me know when this Rubin arrives."
504879, "I wouldn't say he died naturally. He died of a mysterious disease. Microbes are more efficient killers than demons."
504880, "No one has touched the body since his death. The tradition kept in our family forbids us from seeing the dead until a certain time has passed. The required period of time will last until tomorrow. But I will not stop looking for the killer until you are able to convince me that your assumptions are true. If he was infected, then how did it happen? Next thing you'll tell me it was Isidor that brought the disease into our family home!"
504881, "The most convincing proof would be a body examination! What other proof do you expect?"
504882, "Venerable Bachelor! Do you take me for some wilful old fool who has burdened you, out of spite, with the complicated solution of a simple problem? Or perhaps you think I am covering somebody else's sins, getting in the way of you doing your duty?"
504883, "...Is the body truly isolated as reliably as you say?"
504884, "The body is in the Focus of The Crucible. You cannot examine it now, and I mean that it is technically impossible. No one may see the body before a certain period of time passes, neither master Rubin, nor you, my dear Bachelor, not even myself!"
504885, "I will discuss this with your brother. I mean Victor, obviously."
504886, "All right, let's wait for that period of time to pass."
504887, "You are pushing me towards this conclusion."
504889, "Even if he was deliberately infected by some supernatural entity, I still need to make sure I am right!"
504890, "I need to examine your brother's body."
504892, "Is that a hypothesis or a fact supported by evidence?"
504893, "Where is the body now, Judge?"
504895, "This remote place has a history of its own. There is not enough time to retell it to you, which is unfortunate, since it is the background of the town that may possibly justify some local conventions that will most likely seem barbaric to an educated person like yourself."
504896, "Not at all."
504897, "What traces did history leave in your society then?"
504898, "There are three truths that rule this town. Three origins. Three ideas, if you like. For several generations these three powers have been in conflict with each other. I suspect none of them can exist without the other two, yet each of them still strives to dominate. Each of them has its own voice, too."
504899, "Tell me more."
504900, "These voices are the ruling families. The co-owners of the Bull Project, who have been ruling the town for almost two centuries. Each one of the truths they represent is screaming at the top of its lungs, and in so doing travesties whatever value it carries."
504901, "This is too complicated... I don't see what this has to do with your brother's murder."
504902, "The first voice is the Saburovs. The second is the Olgimskys. The third one is us, the Kains. We are the three heads of one beast. Each of the clans will offer their own understanding of what is going on. Each of the three will use their own voice and the voices of their followers to lie and distort the truth. We cannot exist otherwise. However, in doing so, we will inadvertently reveal the entirety of the truth to anyone who would listen."
504903, "You suggest I believe you?"
504905, "I suggest you believe no one. Perhaps I am the only one of the three rulers that would ask you to disregard his very words. If nothing else, I hope it will win me your favour. At least I am offering you honest advice: you should never trust any of us completely-neither the Kains, nor the Olgimskys, nor the Saburovs."
504906, "Such sincerity does indeed inspire trust."
504907, "I do not trust anyone blindly. That goes against my principles."
504908, "Furthermore, each of us will try to paint a rather ungainly picture of the other two. Most likely we will fill you in on the negative sides of each other faction and withhold anything that is good about them. That is inevitable. None of us will stoop to outright slander, so everything that will be said will most likely be true, but this truth will be one-sided and incomplete. Listen carefully to what we say and take it into account."
504909, "Thank you."
504910, "Your words are a pleasant surprise, Judge."
504911, "The stories of the evil that the Kains have unleashed unto this world are partially true. Do not feel obliged to act in our favour. As you can see, I will stop before nothing to ensure an unbiased investigation; the lack of prejudice I want to instill in you is the one and only reason why I am making a confession like this. I do not want my brother to have died in vain."
504912, "I will take your words seriously, do not worry."
504913, "I have studied philosophy at the university and I take it far more seriously than some of my colleagues; however, I fail to see its usefulness at the time..."
504914, "It's not about philosophy at all, doctor Dankovsky. What I am going to tell you has some direct practical benefit to it. Perhaps my words will even help you survive."
504915, "Really? I'm all ears then."
504916, "Who are they?"
504917, "So much pathos... So, all you wanted to inform me about was the three contradictory versions?"
504918, "All I'm saying is that we have all been offered a puzzle. Depending on the solution, heads will roll and backs will get broken. The conclusion had better be the right one... because of the greatness of the cost. These are neither three versions nor three lies. These are the three truths. Three ideologies. Can you imagine how much blood can be shed over an ideology that has a grain of truth to it?"
504919, "I apologize. My remark was inappropriate."
504920, "Do not worry, I only trust proven facts. Words alone carry no weight for me."
504921, "Here our desires concur, Judge."
504922, "What am I supposed to do then?"
504923, "Well, no one will dare lie to your face. I have no doubts everyone will tell you the truth, but they will tell it in such a fashion that this truth will conceal the reality better than any deception would. The only thing I'm asking is that you don't jump to conclusions. Compare different versions. Your extraordinary intelligence will allow you to ascertain the truth."
504924, "That inspires hope."
504925, "So I am surrounded by lies? How exciting. Truth is my only idol. It is only for the truth that I fight."
504926, "I would expect him to join you in the evening, No earlier than eleven o'clock, I would say."
504927, "Why so late?"
504928, "A hypothesis."
504929, "It is a proven fact."
504930, "What is this proof then?"
504931, "Show me the body, Judge, and you will have it."
504932, "Mere hypothesis is not something I am willing to accept. Furthermore, the same rhetoric is widely employed by the people who want to hinder the murder investigation at any cost! The same people are spreading false rumours of civil disorder which, as they would have it, took over the town! The same people would happily sacrifice human life to maintain a semblance of order! What would you say to that?"
504933, "What if there is no murderer? Who are you trying to catch?"
504934, "Till the very last moment I will hope that the murderer does exist. I am not trying to disabuse you of your opinion; however, if you're right, that is a death sentence for us all. Look for the murderer as long as you can."
504935, "Sure, let us go looking for a coin under a streetlamp just because there's more light that way. Is that what you want?"
504936, ""
504938, "Uh, so that man... he's, like, 'dead' dead, right?"
504940, "My life is in your hands. I'm asking so little of you! I'd go to the cemetery myself, but I can't leave this place-what if someone breaks in and finds the body here?"
504943, "Oh, how can I thank you? I'd love to give you some sort of trinket as a token of my gratitude..."
504949, "He's dead, yes. It doesn't take a doctor to see that."
504950, "Oh, I was so scared! He barged in here, all bloody. I thought he was sent here... but he didn't try to attack me. Oh, just look at those hideous wounds! It's like he was cut with precision... to mangle the body as much as possible... Who would do something like this?"
504951, "An experienced surgeon. Someone who knows anatomy. His sinews are cut."
504952, "He was mumbling something to that extent... There's this hunt for Simon Kain's murderer going on, right? Well, they mistook this guy for the culprit, even though he was actually a hunter, not a huntee... It was Simon's murderer that's wounded him so horribly, wasn't it? "
504953, "Why do you think the man himself is not the murderer?"
504954, "But he was going after the murderer! They tried to ambush him at the Station-in case he tries to catch a ride away from the town. And you know what? Their assumptions were correct! This guy did indeed come face to face with the murderer there. Here's the result..."
504955, "Okay. Makes sense. So what do we do now?"
504956, "Just don't you call anyone here, okay? Please, I'm begging you! If they find a dead man in my house... Ah, that's hard to explain, but I promise I'll do so later-when we have the time. I didn't kill him, I swear, and I couldn't have mutilated him so horrendously..."
504957, "I'm not saying you're guilty at all! Whatever even gave you the idea..."
504958, "Oh, many people would be more than happy to accredit this blood to my hands! They just need an excuse, a chance to grab me by the arm-and then they'll twist it so hard that I'll even confess. Just... help me bury him, will you? I can see a spark of kindness in you! Go to the cemetery, tell the caretaker there's someone... less than living in my house."
504959, "Who's the caretaker?"
504960, "Since the old caretaker died... another dark story, huh... anyway, his daughter is the one who's taking care of the cemetery now. Name's Grace. She'll see to this dead man as though he was still alive and kicking... er, I mean figuratively, of course."
504961, "Okay, Anna. I'll help you get rid of the body, no questions asked. I'm expecting to hear an enthralling story afterwards."
504962, "I've thought it over, and here is my decision. I'll tell the Kains all about this; let them evaluate the situation on their own. You are undoubtedly in the right. It's evident."
504966, "And the caretaker won't go about asking unnecessary questions?"
504967, "Hey, why are you so anxious all of a sudden?"
504968, "Is that what he told you before passing away?"
504969, "Well... yeah. Why are you surprised? It makes sense for him to try and explain why he barged in anyway! His story was very haphazard though... actually, he didn't say much at all. But I think I know what had happened."
504970, "Perhaps. So what do we do now?"
504971, "You're too kind. By the way, it was Victor Kain who has sent me here to check on you and your guest. I think one of the chasers that was after the poor sod must have informed him about all this. So what do I tell him?"
504972, "He should be taken to the morgue. There's a good chance he'll be identified there."
504973, "We don't have a morgue in the town. When someone dies, a small service is held, and then they're buried by the family. That's the local tradition. Oh, and there's been no murders since I moved here... it's just so horrible! If this is how it's going to go now... whatever happens to us?"
504974, "So what are you going to do now?"
504975, "I'll call for someone to attest to the death and take the body away."
504977, "So where did he come from?"
504978, "Well, he isn't breathing. No pulse means dead."
504979, "Where did your guest come from?"
504981, "Perhaps it's wiser to take the body straight to the cemetery?"
504982, "Oh, but I'm a weakling... I can barely lift a one-year-old baby. And why should you sweat it either? Grace can always send an undertaker cart here."
504983, "All right, you'll have your cart."
504985, "Wait some more. You'll dispose of him soon enough."
504987, "A silver ring from your lovely finger would be more than enough."
504988, "Then take it as a sign of my affection... No, wait, I've got a better idea. I'll give you several-so that they affect you even more. These are not just any trinkets. Never forget that each of them represents my feelings."
504990, "I'll try."
504999, "It just occurred to me that he could have killed himself."
505000, "Why?"
505001, "I don't know... There's no one else that could have done it. No one, and I mean it! Neither the biggest hater nor the most desperate beggar. I mean, in his case suicide is a way more believable conjecture than murder."
505021, "No, not at all. How could someone living on-or perhaps even beyond-the edge of what's humanly possible not die? At least that's what the smart people are saying. Not my ideas."
505022, "So Simon loved to challenge limits and restrictions, I gather."
505023, "Indeed! He loved it, and he was good at it. You could bury him underground for a couple of days, and he'd be totally fine. He was pierced with iron rods once, too. One of them broke his chest, but Simon didn't die. Tricks like these would've been incredibly popular in a circus! Oh, I miss the man..."
505024, "So who could have killed him? An envier?"
505025, "Nobody is to blame for his death. I honestly believe that Simon was doomed. What he did was too much for a single person to handle."
505026, "I feel my leg being pulled."
505105, ""
505106, "How can I help you?"
505107, "Georgiy has told me everything. Which is to say he told me very little, but it was enough to astound me. He maintains that you can provide a more detailed account."
505110, "There's no need to worry."
505111, "Georgiy is waiting for you, my friend. He has news for you that you'll find surprising. I only ask one thing; don't be too quick to reject his request."
505112, "What does he want from me?"
505113, "He will explain it better himself. We put too many hopes in your arrival. The echo of these hopes has lead him to offer you a rather intricate conundrum to solve."
505114, "What is it?"
505115, "It's not exactly in your line of work-and yet, if we are to believe a certain source which we deem quite trustworthy, it appears that you are the only person that can help our family. The reward will be fitting, of course."
505116, "All right, I'll speak to Georgiy."
505117, "I'll think about it."
505118, "You're scaring me."
505119, "I don't understand."
505120, "Thank you, I'll decide then and there."
505142, "Why am I not allowed to examine the body? I can't work like this."
505143, "Seems absurd, doesn't it? You have been asked to find the murderer, yet the circumstances of the death are being concealed from you... Our traditions are a mere excuse, you know. There's no tradition Georgiy wouldn't disregard for Simon's sake. I think there's a different reason behind my brother's inexcusable conduct..."
505144, "It being...?"
505145, "Georgiy holds your abilities in very high regard. He wants you to reconstruct the crime on your own and is reluctant to let you in on things that will change your entire worldview... probably putting you on a false trail in the process."
505146, "That's some self-importance! My worldview isn't changed so easily."
505147, "The cause of Simon's death is much too significant. It seems we are on the brink of a realization that will be a death warrant to all of us-and, more importantly, to our life's work. Georgiy wants to exhaust all possibilities of finding proof that he is mistaken. Find out the truth, doctor."
505148, "...And he believes that an examination of the body will immediately put me off looking for alternative hypotheses?"
505149, "My goal is to uncover the truth. And I will, one way or another."
505153, "Are you sure of that?"
505154, "It seems, above all, suspicious."

505605, "And what exactly did you see in that dream of yours? The one that had to do with me?"
505606, "A truly terrifying battle is ahead of you. If no one has ever told you about your fate, I will be the first. You must know that I admire you in advance-regardless of the outcome. You will fight a foe that few can defeat."
505607, "Is this a prophecy?"
505608, "You will clash with your foe like a dragon slayer, but your weapon will turn against you. Striking at the heart, you will end up with your own flesh torn. Every drop of blood you squeeze out of that heart will turn into a gulp of yours. If your foe escapes you, penetrates you, or saddles you, you will hear malicious laughter in your ears... and my crestfallen weeping."

506255, "They make much more sense than you may think. This is not a game, is it? For all that is holy, do speak to my uncle-and then come back to me. Otherwise the excruciating anticipation will tear my heart to pieces."
506256, "All right. We cannot put your heart at stake, now can we?"
506257, "Where is your uncle now?"

506610, "So, yesterday you told the Kains that we may possibly have to face an epidemic. I believe you, Bachelor. In all honesty, I am one of the few people that do. The rest are astonishingly blind!"
506611, "Excellent. The most important thing is that I've managed to persuade you."
506613, "I have already received a report of your spectacular success. News of your deeds precedes you. Now I want you to personally convey your opinion on what you have witnessed to Kain and Olgimsky. Then we can consider your mission complete."
506614, "I am listening, Bachelor."
506615, "I've found proof, governor. Here is the key to a house where several people dying in agony are waiting for anyone willing to examine them. Will that be enough?"

As for this case, my friends have noticed a staggering amount of details-and yet they have forgotten to tell me the most important part. So I can only give you a rough direction to the area."
506632, "I'd be more than grateful."
506633, "It's in Earth-the troubled southern part of the town. You could use a guide down there. Find a boy named Sticky. He'll show you the houses that have fallen silent. He will also tell you what is where, so that you don't get confused."
506634, "Thank you."
506635, "I don't get lost easily, actually."
506636, "Like it could ever be simple... What details have they noticed then?"
506637, "The ones you would expect the least. The silence. The moaning chorus from below the ground. Lamentations from behind the windows. Dogs banding together into packs and eating soil. The unusual smell in the air, as if a stinking cloth was burned. A friend of a friend's friend hasn't come to an appointment..."
506638, "I see. So what do I do? How am I supposed to look for these silent houses?"

506642, "Pity."
506643, "You are a good daughter, Victoria."

506645, "Sounds convincing."
506647, "Bachelor Dankovsky, the founder of Thanatica... An unexpected visit."
506648, "I've seen her already."
506651, "So what do you know, angel darling? Has anyone found a disease hotbed?"
506652, "Disturbing rumours were heard from different districts all night. Mostly inconsequential-and mostly driven by everyone's fear of the maneater and the mob's crazed vigilantism. It's all rubbish... but I've found several reports disconcerting."
506653, "Which ones?"
506654, "They were brought to me by second-hand dealers. I've started saving up medicine, you know... ah, never mind. Anyway, everyone's noticed an unusual silence and occasional strange animal behaviour-especially that of dogs. And there were packs of rats, too! The Hunchback said that such things are often left unnoticed in the general panic."
506655, "Yes, it does resemble the first signs of an outbreak. But silence could have been caused by fear. Dogs always get anxious when people do. As for rats... there is a slaughterhouse nearby, isn't there?"
506656, "There were other signs too. Frightening scribblings and repulsive oily spots on walls here and there. Raspy breathing that could only belong to giant lungs can be heard by the silent houses. They say the shabnak, the embodiment of the disease, is breathing poisonous air, leaving her fat on the walls as she walks by."
506657, "Show me where these places are."
506658, "The children know which houses are infected. There were three of them, four tops... You know what? Talk to Capella, the young Olgimskaya. Children are drawn to her like moths to a flame. They tend to hang around everywhere-and report everything to her. She's at the Lump now. And tell her I will share my pills with the children!"
506659, "Okay, I'll talk to Capella. You stay here and don't go anywhere."
506660, "The Lump?"
506661, "That's what the Olgimskys' mansion is called. A large house on the riverbank, the most eye-catching building in the Gut district. It's on the southern bank of the Knots. I'll show you on the map."
506662, "Thanks."
506663, "It's nice to have a network of little agents all over the place. Putting aside the fact that all of them are also little deathbringers now, of course."
506664, "These descriptions tell me nothing; I won't be able to find a hotbed by them. Every hour counts now."
506665, "What am I supposed to do, break into every house that a rat runs by? Especially considering the rulers refuse to provide me with aids!"
506666, "So you're singing someone else's song, singer. Is that all?"
506667, "Enough. Can you show those places on a map?"
506668, "Rubbish? Tell me more about it."
506669, "Gawd... Steppe legends that would probably seem primitive and barbaric to you. Legends of a dead crawler; of a mara that has one of her heads eating what the other has disgorged; of an oily shabnak who has had his bowels dissolved into the ground by grey-haired agas... Need I continue?"
506670, "Don't. Tell me about the hotbeds."
506671, "I've spent a single day and a single night with you people-and I'm already doubting my own definition of barbarism; it all seems to make certain sense. Which rumours did you find disconcerting?"
506672, "And why the hell doesn't anyone believe me, I wonder? Yesterday they were all very busy harping on about my educated opinion being the ultimate truth to them."
506673, ""
506674, "I've seen it all right. Shouldn't have done that... Hey, can you check me-you know, like you doctors do-just in case? Although... they say if you get sick you can feel it straight away-it feels as if someone was pouring boiling tar straight into you... Yeah."
506675, "...No fever. You're fine. So have you sneaked into infected houses? Which ones?"
506676, "One's really close by, just across the yard. That's one freaky place, all right... All hot and smeared with bloody fat... Eeuhh... They say bloody mould was crawling up the walls during the First Outbreak too. Like a scab."
506677, "All right, I'll go check."
506678, "What makes you think houses like these are infected?"
506679, "Nothing... I'm not that sure really... But you said yesterday that Simon died of a disease, so I put two and two together. I'm not a baby, I know how things work. And I don't really believe in all that Steppe stuff, even though I live next to the Kin. My friend's father is a tanner-he says it's all hogwash too."
506680, "So a Silent House is somewhere nearby?"
506681, "Come, I'll show you."
506682, "No, I'll show you! You are not going anywhere. You're staying home and waiting for me to return."
506683, "You don't believe in 'Steppe stuff'? What do you mean?"
506684, "I mean what I'm saying. I respect old customs and all, but trains are more convincing than rites. A lot of folks here believe in Steppe stuff. My mom also smeared our doorstep with horse milk and put bull bones into our pillows, and so what-did that do any good?"
506685, "All right, let's talk later, we've no time to lose."
506686, "You live 'next to the Kin'? What do you mean?"
506687, "There's the Termitary, see? You should take a look at them beasts inside, all howling and whatnot. Well, everyone who lives there is a Steppe person, who sucked in that creepy stuff with their mother's milk. Do you know the tale of leather teeth? What about the one of putrid milk? Or Aga's quest for her granddaughter?"
506688, "No, I don't. Stay home and don't go anywhere."
506689, "I should beat the living daylights out of you for that! How many of you have been to silent houses? Show me where they are. Saburov will see them blocked off."
506690, "Heh, like that Saburov of yours can do a thing... Here, in Earth, Olgimsky's the man. He could make workers walk on their heads, and no one would say a word against him."
506691, "Enough. I am the man now. Where are the silent houses?"
506692, "Are there many of you dumbheads that have been inside those houses?"
506693, "Not really... I'm the bravest! So not that many. Maybe half a dozen stuck around. Half a dozen more were throwing stones at the houses. I was the only one that actually sneaked inside! They could've done that afterwards though-just to outshine my feat. The doors are unlocked now, after all..."
506694, "Twelve... idiots. All right, I'll check what's going on in there."
506695, "Where are they now?"
506696, "Hanging around somewhere... you can go whistle for them. I'm not their babysitter. If I see them guys, I'm supposed to send them straight to you, right?"
506697, "...It seems that any further actions on my part would be pointless."
506698, "Let's pray that there's nothing bad in there."
506699, "I think I know what we need to be looking for. I've heard all that stuff about a turnskin, a bloodsucker, a maneater; about it being a man and about it being a woman. I've heard the tales of an invisible many-headed beast that can go through walls. But that's all hogwash."
506700, "All right, enlighten me. What else is there to find?"
506701, "The killer is unusual, but it exists. We need to be looking for the carrier of the disease. Right, Master?"
506702, "Now I hear a man talking. Who is it?"
506703, "A man-like creature, skin so pale that it seems to be gleaming. It comes from under the ground sometimes, turns up somewhere around the Rotten Field, between the Cemetery and the Abattoir."
506704, "Have you seen it?"
506705, "Once. Not sure that was the thing though. We've tried to follow it a couple of times, but it always knows it's being followed. Anyway, it fits the description. A rather strange thingie. I can even imagine why folks say it has several heads."
506706, "Why?"
506707, "Because it does."
506708, "That was a stupid joke, boy."
506709, "I won't ever believe a thing you say anymore..."
506710, "Rubbish."
506711, "Sticky, I'm too big for this kind of games."
506712, "Right. But I'll find the carrier myself."
506713, "Of course it's hogwash. And I've had enough of this."
506714, "There was no killer and there is no killer, boy. There was only an accident."
506715, "Will you teach me to tell a person's expected lifespan by their pupils?"
506716, "I really hope you've quenched your thirst for acts of valour."
506718, "They are panicking over nothing. Had it been the other way round, it would have been better; we would know what to be afraid of, but the people wouldn't."
506719, "Over nothing? Their panic makes perfect sense."
506720, "Yes, they have stopped lynching girls on a charge of cannibalism and 'possession of two souls', but if the dead keep piling up, they will go looking for someone to pin that on."
506721, "Perhaps not without reason."
506722, "Perhaps. I hope you will help them realize their suspicions are groundless."
506723, "Time will tell, governor."
506724, "That depends on what happens today."
506725, "We'll be able to stop the threat before the panic turns into a catastrophe, but only if I'm supported rather than stonewalled."
506726, "Everything is in your hands, Bachelor."
506727, "I know what I'm doing."
506729, "People are often sharper than those who are responsible for them."
506730, "The prices are rising with every passing minute. People are panicking. Isn't this reason enough for the rulers to declare a state of emerency?"
506731, "I have received express messages from Kain and Olgimsky. No one will dare interfere with my choices now! We are declaring quarantine. We'll create an anti-epidemic operational headquarters. I plan to assign ourselves to be its supervisors. Myself because it is my duty, you because that would be fair. We must fight shoulder to shoulder. Do you agree?"
506732, "It is my direct duty now as well."
506733, "From now on infected districts will be blocked off. No one will leave the town until the situation is resolved. You will be allowed access to any and all areas of the town, of course. Neither Kain nor Olgimsky will have any right to stop you. You will have to provide the... population with clear instructions. Be careful about it. It's not my place to mentor you though."
506734, "How are you planning to block the districts off?"
506735, "I will recruit volunteers. We will pick trustworthy ones-people of good standing, family men with good reputations. I will grant them the widest range of authority. They will thwart any violence or looting. They will also stop any attempts to use arms."
506736, "Tell them of my special status, governor."
506737, "Where and when can I be armed?"
506738, "Here. Take good care of it. Firearms are rare in this town. If you need a gun, your best bet would be looking for it on the black market; some townsfolk may keep makeshit, outdated, or prohibited guns... I am sure that those who do, will want to use them sooner or later. That is how we'll find them. But I have almost none at hand."
506739, "That is truly regrettable... Thank you for this anyway."
506740, "I have no idea how you plan to stop a frenzied mob without weapons..."
506741, "Of course. I will send you the text. However, I need a weapon-and the unrestricted right to use it."
506742, "I need unrestricted authority, access to all districts, and a personal firearm."
506743, "You will declare quarantine as soon as the train with me on board disappears in the distance."
506744, "I doubt the train will leave this place, doctor. I have no right to allow the risk of pandemic. Moreover-and this should come as no surspise to you-I have received certain instructions from the Powers That Be about this. Specifically, about your departure."
506745, ".....Is that so. What are you planning to do then?"
506746, "I'll find a way to get out of here in any case."
506747, ""
506748, "Who is it...? Is that a person...? Will you help me...?"
506749, "What's wrong with you? Can't you see me?"
506750, "So hot... It hurts! My head... is about to burst... Blood is curdling in my veins... I'd scream, but I don't want the children to hear..."
506751, "There are no children here."
506752, "Just... Don't kill us-don't kill them if they ask you for help... Their mind is clouded with pain... They can't even find each other... They're only praying... Don't come close to them... And step away from me too."
506753, "We don't have much time left! Hurry..."
506754, "I want to ease your suffering."
506762, ""
506765, "See what you've done, doctor... You won't be able to leave this place now. The town is blocked off. I've transferred my powers over to Saburov. He didn't hesitate to express his gratitude by assigning me to the position of an... intendant. Now I'm in charge of equipping and maintaining infirmaries..."
506766, "I'm not planning to leave."
506767, "It is. The Station is shut off... but it will be reopened when a regular freight train arrives. It will definitely be, doctor... That's when we'll discuss how to... snatch ourselves a vehicle there."
506768, "Thank you, but I have no plans to leave at the moment. Especially no illegal plans."
506769, "Pity. I wanted to ask a favour of you in return... but I will do that later, later... I want you to get to know your new allies better... the Kains and the Saburovs... Otherwise it will be less dramatic."
506770, "We will have an opportunity to come to an agreement."
506771, "I have no desire to do business with you, boös Vlad."
506773, "When is the train scheduled to arrive?"
506774, "Any day now... In fact, it was supposed to arrive some time ago... I'm surprised it hasn't... The government has to realise how dependant we are on their deliveries... Our survival is at risk here."
506775, "Your survival is at risk for an entirely different reason."
506776, "Then do protect the supplies, dear intendant."
506777, "I'm sure the train is not the only line of communication with the rest of the world."
506778, "You would like to inspect the Termitary? Did I hear you right?"
506779, "I would. I have a strong suspicion that the disease could have gotten inside."
506780, "You need not go to the Termitary... Even if you manage to get past the guards, you'll be ripped apart inside. It is hard for you to imagine what it's like in there. They sleep on the floor hugging bulls... It's all a big stable. They can't even talk, they only howl and whine..."
506781, "Was it you that have brought them to this state?"
506782, "Come now... this is their natural state. They are half-men, half-animals. The Termitary is inhabited by a single creature-the Kin. It takes skill to communicate with them... Yes. Skill."
506783, "You have convinced me."
506784, "I must insist nonetheless."
506785, "The Termitary... And the whole Project... are my domain, doctor. And I have told you more than once already that I don't like it when anyone interferes with my domain. The Termitary will not be unlocked without my consent. You keep it in mind... If there really is a threat of an epidemic... I'll take advantage of the situation and keep it blocked... to avoid unnecessary unrest."
506786, "I see."
506787, "This sounds rather suspicious..."
506788, "You have peculiar working conditions."
506793, "No. I have absolutely no desire to knock on that coffin."
506794, "I'm listening."
506795, "Tell me, boös Vlad, what's going on in the Termitary at the moment?"
506797, "You're thinking of leaving this inhospitable place, aren't you? Old Kain and his whims must be getting on your nerves already..."
506798, "I like Kain. I understand his motives and hold no grudges. Furthermore, he has a charming niece."
506799, "Well, anyway... It wasn't I that has ordered to shut the Station down; the order came from the Crucible. You see... Kain does have the right. Even though I am and have always been in charge of the train services... So that is rather disrespectful."
506800, "Are you implying that you could have helped me find a vehicle if not for Kain abusing his power?"
506801, "Why... it's a matter of respect. Don't get me wrong. I don't like Kain taking over my domain even if he does technically have the right to... I understand family sentiments. Going after the killer is a rather honourable endeavour... But I have a feeling this killer won't be leaving the town by train."
506802, "I have a suspicion that there might be an epidemic. Have you heard about it?"
506803, "Right... Let's get this settled straight away and not come back to the subject again... I am a businessman. I work with facts rather than ideas, suspicions, or theories. I'll help you leave the town as soon as you find a way to... calm Kain down."
506804, "I'll keep that in mind."
506805, "I'll find a way to persuade him."
506806, "What makes you think so? Do you know something?"
506807, "Why doesn't it sit well with you?"
506809, "Yes, my work here is done."
506810, "The Station is shut off, and yet you're willing to help me get out of here? Why?"
506811, ""
506829, "I feel guilty for having misled you, dear Bachelor. Forgive this old man... I thought your ignorance of our local affairs would mystically skew the circumstances in your favour. Forgive me if I was wrong. There is no unexpected news to be heard, is there?"
506830, "No. The disease is spreading around the town already. It is necessary that we urgently appoint mid-level executives. Get all the doctors and hospital attendants."
506831, "Let Saburov take care of that. After all, he was the one to demand emergency powers from us, which were granted. I've already sent all of my men to assist him, as well as an appreciable amount of money to further his administrative activities. We don't have any doctors or hospital attendants. The only man that knows something about medicine is currently examining my brother's body. It is strange there's been no news from him so far... We need to send someone after him."
506832, "And what about you? What are you going to do?"
506833, "We will fight... until the very end. I will personally persecute those who would dare describe this disease as some kind of preordained divine retribution! I will attack anyone who would say Simon got what he deserved! Finally, I will not allow anyone to say that what Simon has built by ceaseless labour is subject to inevitable destruction."
506834, "Retribution for what?"
506835, "Sooner or later the one who dares challenge the mechanics of nature will pay the price. But this is not something we'd want to believe, is it? This is a conclusion drawn by people who tend to mistake their exhaustion for wisdom. However, even an echo would sometimes grow to become deafening noise. If people keep saying we're doomed, they might well bring about our extinction. "
506836, "What now, Judge?"
506837, "We're not that different from each other, dear Bachelor. I am grateful for everything you've done for us, I appreciate the risk you took to help us, and I am much obliged for the disheartening conclusion you have reached. No matter what you are going to do, you can count on our full support. The reward we have promised you will be duly delivered. Victor will make all the necessary arrangements."
506838, "Thank you, Judge. I must take my leave now."
506839, "I won't leave you on your own in this battle, Georgiy. We have a common foe and we will fight this foe together."
506840, "I would never draw a conclusion like this. That would bring my whole lifework to naught."
506841, "Everything that I have seen here makes me think this is the case."
506842, "I can only wish you luck."
506843, "Is it really inevitable? So this omnipresent fatalism is in your nature too?"
506844, "What news did you expect?"
506845, "Till the very last moment I hoped that my brother's demise was of... mechanical nature. That he had suffered a violent death. I was waiting so eagerly for it to be proven. The cause of his death will undoubtedly become the reason all of us will die. So it's the Plague after all... Even if it were the nail-eater, an evil spirit of the Steppe legends, the fight would have been easier. "
506846, "Will you fight?"
506847, "At first I thought the loss had broken your spirit."
506848, "In all honesty, it drives me mad to be a pawn in someone else's covert game. What the hell did I risk my hide for?"
506849, "I hold no grudges. Perhaps I would have done the same if I were you."
506850, "Do we still have a shred of hope?"
506851, "There is going to be an outbreak in the town. Face the truth, Judge. We cannot bring your brother back, but we can avert another tragedy."
506852, ""
506853, "Is it true? The thing you've found out? You don't have to comfort me-just tell me if it's true. Is there a hope that you're wrong?"
506854, "I've learned a lot of things in the last couple of days that I would have never considered to be true before..."
506855, "My heart is beating so heavily... It's about to jump out!"
506856, "Andrey has agreed, but he won't leave without Peter, and Peter doesn't want to go anywhere."
506857, "I'll try to persuade him... but I don't think I'll succeed. Maria would do much better though... Do you think she may agree to help?"
506858, "Is there no other way? I don't think I should discuss our escape with... Maria Kaina."
506859, "Well, Eva, everyone is ready. We found a way to win Peter over."
506860, "Then let Andrey take care of the rest and make us ready for the departure. Just tell him that we must hurry-any minute can become our last... If it begins just like it began during the First Outbreak, we won't even manage to get to the Knots.... Oh god, oh my god..."
506861, "Why didn't you come?"
506862, "How awful... I have fainted... I didn't sleep during the day at all, I was so anxious... Forgive me! Is it too late? Can we go?"
506863, ""
506864, "Sit. Take a load off your feet."
506865, "Eva wants to flee the town before it's too late. She said only you can make that happen."
506866, "Flee? Why in the world? Have yesterday's murders scared her so much? No one will dare lay a finger on her!"
506867, "A killer more dangerous than a Steppe spirit is at large. There will be an epidemic, Andrey. Rubin told me it's called the 'Sand Pest'. Does it ring any bells?"
506868, "Peter doesn't believe me either! What's wrong with you people? How can I persuade him?"
506869, "And rightly so. Take a look around. You should have seen what the Crude Sprawl looked like during the outbreak! The houses that Burakh had locked up were literally in agony, their walls swollen with boils, their windows covered in scarlet mould. There were blisters everywhere; blood mixed with ichor was flowing from the chimneys... That's how it was."
506870, "Your brother has agreed."
506871, "Well, don't let the door hit our asses on our way then. There are plenty more shitholes in the world. I might need a gun though. Do you have a weapon?"
506872, "Where were you? Why didn't you come?"
506873, "Some shithead patrolmen came here. They were tipped off! I managed to break an arm to one of them, but the others brought me down. The bastards hit hard... They collared my brother at the bridge and made him come home. Eva is unconscious."
506874, "All set. We're armed."
506875, "Okay. Let's meet by the Station at 10 PM. Don't get too close to the engine though."
506876, ""
506877, "I can't shrug away the feeling that someone's scratching at the window sill..."
506878, "Your brother suggests we escape this place."
506879, "Escape? This place? Is he out of his mind?"
506880, "A plague is about to break out here-the local Sand Plague strain, to be more precise. There are no medical records of it. However, you seem to have had the pleasure of witnessing it in action."
506881, "...I don't care. My body is so full of twyrine that no disease will ever be able to even approach, let alone touch me. Same with brother Andrey... unless he gets it from his wenches. No, I'm not leaving this place..."
506883, "Bloody hell... Are you sure about this?"
506884, "Why did none of you come?"
506885, "The patrol got us. They collared me right in the street, and I think my rib is broken. They have heavy fists... sons of butchers."
506886, ""
506887, "You're giving me a stony stare. Is something wrong? Are you disappointed?"
506888, "Tell me, Maria, do you have any influence on Peter Stamatin?"
506889, "He has a greater influence on me. Why do you ask?"
506890, "I want to persuade the brothers Stamatin to leave for the Capital, but Peter doesn't want to. How can I convince him?"
506891, "You want to take the Stamatins away from here? And you're asking me to help? You are obviously out of your mind... Who do you think I am? Oh, I see. You're laughing at me; but I'm too anxious now to smile at a good joke..."
506892, ""
506893, "There's panic everywhere, right? The prices are rising by the hour-not to mention that we haven't received any provisions for several months. The shops are empty. The people are eager to buy anything at exorbitant prices. Everyone is trying to prepare themselves for the epidemic."
506894, "You're not going anywhere. It's a general rule, Lara: those who stay in, survive. Those who go around shopping, die. Get it?"
506895, "I need to collect Vlad the Younger's, Yulia's, and Maria Kaina's donations. Tell them that you are acting on my behalf. Then you'll need to find the best prices and buy as much bread, smoked meat, and fish as possible-only the products that don't go bad quickly! You'll need to take it all to the House of the Living. I'll show you where it is."
506896, "Is that what you're calling the future shelter? A lovely name."
506897, "Thank you. And forgive me for burdening you with time-consuming and mundane errands. But one day a lot of people will be very thankful that we've managed to take care of the vital issues beforehand..."
506898, "I know."
506900, "I've obtained the rations. But there are very odd orderlies standing by the house you've directed me at. They're using theatrical masks and costumes as disease protection. As far as I understood..."
506901, "Yes, I know... The House of the Living will have to be relocated here. Remember that you're always welcome at the Shelter. We'll preserve the stock, distributing the food in small portions; we will make it. I hope it all ends soon..."
506902, "Here is what you asked for."
506903, "Is this all you've managed to buy?"
506905, "I managed to buy very little. The shopowners are demanding a cart of grain's worth for a loaf of bread."
506906, "We need more. There are shops that throw goods out at bargain prices from time to time-it's because people say that requisitions are to begin soon. Please, you're our only hope! Everyone I set on this mission have brought twice as little as required."
506907, "I'll try to work a miracle."
506909, ""
506910, "Everyone's dead here, see? No one knows why. Perhaps it's an echo of yesterday's vendetta... We're a bit at a loss about this loss ourselves."
506911, "What am I supposed to do with the provisions?"
506912, "The dead have no use for it. Give your offerings to Lara. Wasn't it she that asked you to bring food? She wanted to call her shelter the House of the Living, didn't she?"
506913, ""
506914, "What is going on in the town? I wish I could go out and see for myself..."
506915, "I've come on Lara Ravel's request."
506916, "Oh, true... She did say that she needed to buy some provisions; stock up on drinking water and whatnot... Some couriers have offered their services to me already, and then there was this profiteering peddler who visited yesterday. The mind boggles. Just to think that all this hullabaloo was caused by the death of one single man..."
506917, "There is an epidemic hazard; the disease we are about to face is likely to be more terrible than plague, Yulia. One man's death has nothing to do with it."
506918, "Lara wanted to meet you to collect the donations for the House of the Living. I prohibited her from going outside-and I strongly advise you against doing so."
506919, "Yes, I'm giving her my personal savings. I tried to persuade my father to spare some money from the family funds, but they still refuse to believe in the outbreak. That is just the family line at the moment."
506920, "Unfortunately, I have."
506921, "Not yet."
506922, "Tell my father about it as soon as possible! If it isn't too late, tell him that I ordered to donate some money to captain Ravel's daughter for the foundation of a shelter. He won't refuse, he will probably offer to donate some himself."
506923, ""
506924, "Can I help you?"
506925, "Lara Ravel is trying to set up a shelter where people could hide from the disease. She needs money. Your daughter has asked you to help."
506926, "Is that so? Hmm, so the canny Bound are preparing for the epidemic already. Lara Ravel... she's the executed captain's daughter, isn't she?"
506927, "I don't know."
506928, ""
506929, "We'll have to figure out how to keep on living."
506930, "I've come at Lara Ravel's request."
506931, "Yes, I remember the arrangement. Here's what I can personally donate. It's a pity I can't extort a nicer sum from my father."
506932, "Can he be convinced somehow?"
506933, "It's no use even trying."
506934, "I can see the difference, but I don't understand the game he's playing."
506942, ""
506958, ""
506959, "Dear men bring dire omens that will cost us dearly, dear doc."
506963, "That changes things. Take this one for free-but it ain't be doin' much shootin' for too long..."
506964, "It'll suit me fine."
506965, "I want to buy medical supplies from you."
506966, "Won't sell you nothin'. Don't have any."
506967, "You're lying. Of course you have some."
507034, "We still have a few precious hours to stop the disease from spreading, just like Isidor Burakh did a few years ago. We need to declare a state of emergency. But I can't do anything. My hands are tied."
507035, "You are the authority. What is barring you from declaring a state of emergency and being proactive?"
507036, "The authority belongs to the triumvirate that is presided over by the Patron-the head ruler. But now that Simon is dead his place is vacant. Georgiy and Vlad are too afraid that the old balance might shift. But these tragic events are reconfiguring the local power landscape."
507037, "And?"
507038, "If I declare a state of emergency at my own discretion, there will be a feud. A civil strife. I need them to acknowledge me at least. To take further action, I need the Olgimskys' money and the Kains' standing. I need Big Vlad's cunning and Georgiy's energy. I also need their servants to follow my orders."
507039, "Why won't they make concessions to you? It's glaringly obvious that every minute counts. Else the town will die. What are they going to rule then?"
507040, "It's their damned infantilism... One of them is a greedy child, another is a whimsical one. They think that if they admit that there is an outbreak in town, it will actually happen, but as long as they refuse to believe it, it simply doesn't exist. It's either megalomania or cunning calculation."
507041, "Ridiculous..."
507042, "By the way, speaking of the Kains' power... They may be right after a fashion... Seems like their will has a certain hidden influence on the world. Things they believe in become closer and somehow more real."
507043, "What can I do to convince them?"
507044, "How can I help you though?"
507045, "Find proof! Any proof. Immediately. While Rubin tampers with the body-and he'll be busy with it for a long time since he's not a professional-the initiative will be lost. Help me, Dankovsky! Find factual proof, show it to them, and they won't be able to deny the truth any longer."
507046, "How?"
507047, "I've asked several people I trust for help. Perhaps they have already offered to help you too? Some of them have sent word to me already. Furthermore, Anna, the current owner of the Willows, is positive that she knows how to find irrefutable proof of the outbreak. She needs a competent person to assist her."
507048, "Well, come to an agreement then! Time is of the essence."
507049, "We have already exchanged opinions, and they have stated theirs quite clearly. The answer is no. They fail to see the obvious-or refuse to, perhaps. However, my decisions will be useless if the Kains and the Olgimskys keep sabotaging them . We can only instill order and catch the disease before it runs wild if we unite."
507051, "Who is in charge of maintaining order in the town?"
507052, "I am. For many years the Saburovs have held executive power in their hands. The problem is that, until now, we haven't had a serious reason to enforce it. In times of peace the scale tipped to favour the legislative branch-that is, the Kains."
507053, "What is preventing you from using your power now?"
507054, "How can I persuade Kain and Olgimsky?"
507055, "Why don't you assign volunteers or mercenaries to the task?"
507056, "The heads of the families won't trust my mercenaries; but they will trust you. Firstly, your impeccable honesty got you in trouble in the Capital, and that is as good a credential as any. Secondly, you are new to our town and cannot be acting on anyone's behalf."
507057, "Very well, I'm convinced. How are you planning to look for proof?"
507058, "Fine. I'll speak to her."
507059, "Looking for infection hotspots is a dangerous job."
507060, "Undoubtedly. This is why I'm asking you-if you would offer your assistance at all, of course-to get there before the people that are prepared to risk their lives for public wellbeing do. They probably have no idea of how to ensure their own safety in a situation like this. Talk them out of it before it's too late."
507061, "Of course I will. Don't worry about that."
507062, "If I manage to get there in time. It's their personal choice to risk their lives, after all."
507063, "I haven't offered my assistance yet. Why should I waste my time engaging in dubious ventures?"
507064, "Time is of the essense. Anna knows how to recognize the places where you can observe the proof of your hypothesis with your very eyes. If we are to localize the epidemic, it's essential to find and cordon off those places. It's strange that I have to explain that to you."
507065, "I'll think about it."
507066, "What do you intend to do?"
507067, "Sadly, this is now my direct duty. I received a letter from the Powers That Be testifying to that extent. What steps are you planning to take?"
507068, "Do what you think is apt. I only ask two things of you. First of all, take good care of yourself. Drink. Eat. Sleep. Be careful. I'm afraid many will take advantage of this situation to either settle old accounts or fulfil their hidden agendas. Secondly, spare those lives that can be spared."
507069, "Thank you for the advice. Although I must admit it's rather useless given the situation..."
507070, "I will act according to the circumstances."
507071, "I've found a house with more dead than living."
507072, "I will do that."
507073, "Why can't someone else do that?"
507074, "Please. I would like them to hear it from you, not from me."
507075, "Very well."
507076, "Anyone can do that. I will be willing to confirm my words if needed though."
507077, "They're waiting for you at the Willows then. To be honest, I still haven't had a chance to get acquainted with the new owner of the house... She leads a very isolated life."
507078, "You can count on me."
507084, "The town is in danger. There may be an epidemic."
507085, "I don't want to believe that! And I won't believe that to the very end, doctor!"
507086, "But why?"
507087, "There is a certain... political subtlety to this... If you're right, my dear doctor, 'the labour of our life is condemned', as our Judge likes to say... Let's wait and see... Rubin is working on Simon, isn't he? He is. No troubling news from him so far."
507088, "If I am right and you keep sitting on your hands, you will be condemned regardless of whether you admit to my rightness or not. But if you do, we will have a chance to curb the threat."
507089, "If I admit to your rightness, I might as well put together my last will. Do you understand? Of course you don't... Unfortunately, I cannot explain this to you. That is what the current power landscape dictates."
507090, "You will come to regret it."
507091, "Fine. I'll find a way to convince you."
507092, "And you are willing to risk the lives of the people that have committed themselves to your cause and position for 'political subtleties'?"
507093, "That's because he is no bacteriologist, damn it! Where is he anyway?"
507094, "I don't know. Several hours won't change anything. Everyone went bonkers yesterday, and they're still panicking now. Serious matters are better tackled with a cool head."
507095, "It will be too late."
507096, "But this is a crime!"
507097, "But what's in this for you...?"
507098, "The noise that has been raised around this situation is unpleasant and... disadvantageous to me."
507099, "Why?"
507100, "Pray forgive me... You're asking too many questions... You have come to see Simon. Simon is dead. You are more than eager to get back to your research. I want to help you because this is my duty as a ruler and as a... local minister of transport, so to speak. I think it's pretty straightforward."
507101, "Okay... so it is."
507102, "I don't suppose you are aware of the orders I received this morning. My duty now is to stay here until the threat of an epidemic is neutralized."
507103, "I don't know anything about that. Make up your mind."
507104, "I already have."
507105, "SCALPEL. A large cartilage scalpel. Can be used as a close combat weapon. Not very easy to handle, but very effective due to its sharpness. Deals the most damage when attacking from the front. Frequent use causes it to dull quickly."
507106, "KNIFE. An ordinary meat-cutting knife. Can be used as a melee weapon. Not as good as a sharp scalpel in a face to face fight, but can instantly kill if stabbing the back. Becomes dull and brittle after about half a hundred blows."
507108, "RIFLE. An outdated model of army rifle. Powerful, reliable, and long-ranged, it became a favorite of soldiers and craftsmen during the latest war. Is light and has a soft recoil. A useful weapon for long-range combat. Its main drawback is the slow rate of fire."
507109, "REVOLVER. A six-round semi-automatic revolver. Employed by certain special units in the active army. Accurate and has a good fire rate, but only limited penetrative power. Easy to handle with weak recoil and good balance. Such revolvers are a rarity in modern times."
507112, "REVOLVER AMMO. A revolver bullet with a round nose. Steel jacket, steel core. A relatively rare type of round. It's recommended to use it sparingly."
507113, "A five-liter canister of flamethrower fuel."
507114, "RIFLE AMMO. This ammo is for long-barrelled rifles. The heavy bullet with a lead core in a steel jacket is highly lethal at long distances. Fired from the army rifle."
507115, "MONEY."
507116, "I do not wish to believe this! I need the truth, but I need it proven, not based on revelations. If what you say is true, doctor, the labour of our life is condemned. We will seek a different answer till the very end."
507117, "A wise man once dropped a coin in the dark, but kept looking for it under the streetlight only because there was more light there. Need I say that he found nothing?"
507118, "Why?"
507119, "That's what the current power landscape demands."
507120, "This is suicide."
507121, "It is you who wants to look under the streetlamp. I'm encouraging you to make another journey into the darkness."
507122, "I can't say I agree with your line of thinking."
507123, "I'll bring you the proof you need!"
507124, "I'll bring you the proof you need!"
507125, "But what for? You said you trust my opinion. Well, here it is: Simon has died of plague!"
507126, "Admitting he died like that means letting the killer escape. If we acknowledge that no murder took place, the murderer will have a chance to flee. I need to know what exactly it was that sufficed to end Simon's life. Do not mistake it for senile obstinacy, doctor! It's my final attempt to save us all."
507127, "I have a letter from the Powers That Be. They are also writing about an epidemic. Don't you find it convincing?"
507128, "I don't. The domain of the Powers That Be is somewhere above us. They don't understand us and treat us as if we were their toys. I have no desire to give heed to them. Besides, weren't you the one to have suffered their idiocy in the first place? What makes you give any currency to their opinion now?"
507129, "I don't understand you, Judge. What is your agenda? Your plan?"
507162, "The Sand Dirt! Is it true? Has Simon died of the Sand Pest?"
507164, "Why won't they?"
507165, "What?! Is that what Rubin said? Bullshit. Five years ago it spread like fire in a dry forest. Burakh managed to grab it by the tail back then. If it were the Sand Plague again, drama queens would have spread it all over the place yesterday. The town would have been crammed full of dead men by today."
507166, "Really?"
507167, "On the other hand, Eva is somewhat right... Yeah! It's time to leave the place. Yesterday's orgy was disgusting. The fight for the throne is about to begin, and I don't want to see its consequences. We can't stay here any longer. Are you with us?"
507168, "So we're leaving?"
507169, "If my brother agrees, of course. I am obviously not going anywhere without him."
507170, "I'll speak to him."
507171, "I won't go anywhere myself anyway."
507172, "Anyone who touches her will have to deal with me afterwards. That's reason enough already."
507173, "Does dealing with you feel that bad?"
507174, "It ends in various types of bloodshed, massacres, and broken spines. I don't kill people, but I will break the neck to anyone who dares attack a woman."
507175, "Hopefully there won't be an opportunity for me to witness that."
507176, "How has Isidor managed to do that?"
507177, "He acted very resolutely. Burakh locked and boarded up every infected house. It was a miracle. The old man used to have a brilliant intuition... Why do you ask?"
507178, "Because the Sand Plague-or whatever it's called-has come to your town."
507179, "Professional curiosity,"
507180, "So, you and Rubin do mean that? No, that's impossible. Had Simon died because of that, none of the Kains would still be alive by now. Rubin is mistaken."
507181, "Eva thinks otherwise. Will you help her leave?"
507182, "Let's hope you're right. Forget about this conversation."
507183, "Metaphors..."
507184, "No. I'm not being metaphoric, these are the facts. There was moaning and howling all over Earth-moaning louder than the mourning siren at the Works. The tormented were screaming so loudly glass would break in the windows-and it all happened over the course of several hours. That is what the Sand Pest is. So knock your bullshit off."
507185, "Okay. What can persuade Peter?"
507186, "A convincing discovery supporting your theory could help. That outbreak has left a dreary impression on Peter. He's been heavily into twyrine since then; but there is no Sand Plague in town, so... poor you. Tell Eva that the plan fell through because of Peter. Perhaps that will comfort her."
507187, "I'll look for this discovery of yours."
507188, "I'll communicate that to Eva."
507189, "How was it stopped?"
507190, "Burakh did something. It was all over before anyone could realize what had happened. The dead were cremated. They even tried to save someone, I think."
507191, "So what am I supposed to tell Eva?"
507192, "No."
507193, "I could use more."
507194, "Right. Let's do the preparations separately then. Here's some money. The black market around here is run by a mongrel calling himself Bad Grief... Have you met the rodent already?"
507195, "I have an armory. If only I knew what enemy I'm arming myself against..."
507196, "Then we need to buy ammo. By the way, these old cavalry revolvers are verified to misfire often. You'd be better off carrying several guns, just like in the good old days. When one of them fails, another will work."
507197, "Where can I buy them? There are no guns or ammo for sale, I've been looking all over."
507198, "I have."
507199, "You can always find human-killing stuff at Grief's. Now then. He'll obviously try to rob you as best he can, but you only need to say 'Andrey is off to the kennel' to him and he'll change the tune immediately. He may even give you something for free."
507200, "No, I didn't have time for it."
507201, "He resides at the northern Warehouses."
507202, "And so?"
507203, "Okay. Then what?"
507204, "Then you come back. Meanwhile I'll try to think of a way to get on Gugong's good side."
507205, "Who's Gugong?"
507206, "One of the locals-a deaf-and-dumb train driver. Not quite human. Made of soil and bones, glued together with sticky blood and inspired with thick twyrine-just like all his Steppe brethren. I'd break his neck, but the engine wouldn't go anywhere without him... Don't you frown, I'll deal with him."
507207, "That is fortunate."
507208, "Whoa! What does that phrase mean?"
507209, "An old business of ours. It means that he forgot who I was while I was busy drinking in this den."
507210, "All right. Then what?"
507211, "It's a deal."
507212, "I won't."
507213, "See you then."
507214, "Damn it..."
507216, "Incidentally, are you aware that no one believes you? Seems like Saburov the despot was the only significant person to have sided with you. He could have prevented the disaster, but it's too late now!"
507217, "I've come on Saburov's behalf. Real proof is required for the rulers to devolve their powers to him and begin cooperating. And you know where to find it, don't you?"
507218, "Oh, it's all such a mess... we've been living a very quiet life for a while, we're not used to... A lot of people were killed yesterday, you know... I still can't believe it. It's like a pagan demon had passed through the town, possessing the crowd, committing foul murder, and somehow remaining invisible..."
507219, "So what was it you wanted to tell me?"
507242, "What, is she supposed to refashion her own home into a lazar house now?"
507243, "She won't need it anymore anyway. Lara only has a few days left. Do persuade her to make the most of them..."
507244, "What? Is she going to die?"
507245, "How should we know? We are not the ones in charge here. We only know one thing for certain-it won't take long. We have nothing to do with it."
507246, "Who does then?"
507247, "That will become very obvious very soon. Hurry, or poor Lara will die of starvation today..."
507248, "I will find a way to get to you, just you wait."
507249, "Who are you? Are you an actor from the Theatre?"
507250, "Liar!"
507251, "You have a sour sense of humour."
507252, "Yes, you're right."
507253, "No. Do I look like an actor? I'm, like, the opposite of an actor. I've merely borrowed this outfit, you see. It covers the face and... hmm... offers some sort of protection. Moreover, it conceals the disgusting sights and gets rid of the omnipresent stench!"
507254, "Sorry, what?"
507255, "The mask has no eye openings, only these narrow slits. See? It's like I'm squinting. And there are ground grains saturated with twyrine brew in the beak. They kill microbes and get rid of the smell."
507256, "So you know about the disease already?"
507257, "I do."
507258, "Where did you get the information?"
507259, "You know that already, kind sir... don't you?"
507260, "Take the provisions. I've been told to give them to you."
507261, "Who should I give these packages to? There are bread, meat, and fish there."
507262, "What exactly are you talking about?"
507264, "My colleague Rubin suspects as much..."
507265, "He has. Why are you so scared?"
507266, "It's unclear yet. He's most likely been struck down by chicken-pox."
507267, "Then we need to run away from here, Daniil. Immediately! Even if we have to move exclusively by foot-we need to go now! We will die in the Steppe, of course, but at least it won't be as excruciating!"
507268, "Fine. I'm sick of this place anyway. When is the train leaving?"
507269, "I can't leave, Eva. But I can help you leave."
507270, "No... I won't leave this place without you. But we can't stay here! I'm not afraid of death, you know. I once jumped off a building site and only survived by a miracle. But I don't want to die... of this...! Please! Let us all leave!"
507271, "A freight train full of meat, leather, and raw materials departs from the Station every month. Women of the Kin bid it farewell with sorrowful songs and mourning-that's the ritual..."
507272, "You've only known me for a few hours..."
507273, "Tell me how we can get away from here."
507274, "All of us won't fit into even the longest of trains. Calm down, Eva, I'm staying here."
507275, "So what?"
507276, "What do you suggest?"
507277, "I came here without any additional rituals, and I am planning to leave the place in the same fashion."
507278, "But you haven't touched the bull meat train. It's an entirely different thing."
507279, "Can we bargain with the driver?"
507280, "No. He's deaf-and-dumb. Moreover, he's not quite a man. His position is sacred to him... There is a way out though. I think I know of a man who could intimidate even a deaf-and-dumb odongh..."
507281, "Okay, I'll relay your request to him."
507282, "Fine. So the three of us are leaving."
507283, "No, Eva, no one leaves the town. We need to quarantine the place."
507284, "An odongh? Who is that?"
507285, "An 'odongh' means 'he who holds Him by the horns'. That's what the people that bring in bulls from the Steppe are called."
507286, "Can we bargain with the driver?"
507287, "Okay, I'll ask Maria."
507288, "Why? Or is she... Ah, no, okay... Do you have any real proof of the forthcoming outbreak?"
507289, "I do."
507290, "There is no other way... Talk to Maria! She's Nina's heir. The twins won't listen to anyone else but her. Peter is so unpredictable... But Maria knows how to clench his heart. One word from her would be enough for Peter to change his mind."
507291, "I'll try."
507292, "Only master Rubin's account."
507293, "No, that's not enough."
507294, "He has disappeared too anyway. I can't find him myself."
507295, "Don't worry."
507296, "The town is blocked off, Eva. There is no hope. The Station is occupied with Saburov's patrols. Armed men are all over the place."
507297, "We're dead... When it begins, I'll have to cut my wrists. Yes, that will be for the better... Peter has an antique bath. We could heat some water up..."
507298, "Come on, Eva! Still your weak knees!"
507299, "I will help you if your hand shakes."
507300, "The boss turned out to be a cunt-the Big guy, that is. There's plague all 'round, and there he is, giving absolutely zero shits about the people. He probably knew about it all along and didn't say a thing."
507301, "...What do you mean?"
507302, "He'd hang himself before stopping the pump. He'd have us all dead 'n hangin'-just so that fat gets sucked from the ground and blood gets sucked from the people. Why is the Termitary all corked up? Why did they stop them factories today? Eh, those worker bees won't ever say 'boo' to a goose, they won't..."
507303, "So you're a civil activist now, worrying about the plight of the working people? Weren't it your workers that were cutting the real workers' wives at every dark corner yesterday?"
507304, "You take me for a cunt, doc? We don't take kindly to murderers 'round here, we don't! Whoever kills with a knife is no mate to us, we'll be tearin' the bitch apart ourselves in no time. If someone sidles over to you with a knife, doc, kill 'em, and kill 'em fast. We won't take no offense at that."
507305, "That's comforting."
507306, "Somehow I don't believe you..."
507307, "Why is it corked up then?"
507308, "There's a thousand of herrings packed there, and another thousand on top of that, three thousands more in between and half a thousand by the side. All them workin' bees livin' cooped up together like worms in a dead body. No one's been comin' out of there for three days. So what's the tale, I'm askin', eh? 'An order came through,' they say, 'sabotage suspected...' And then you cracked the plague riddle yesterday, so I got myself an epiphany..."
507309, "You think Vlad quarantined the Termitary?"
507310, "Wouldn't want to let mara the maneater in, now would he? So he probably knew about it all along... Probably wanted Simon to get lost already, lost in the netherworld. 'N all he had to do was just sit tight, y'know, sit tight 'n do nothin'. Whaddyathink?"
507311, "There is some food for thought there..."
507312, "You are slandering Olgimsky, that's what I think."
507313, "But you seem to care about the people oh so very much... Could you please remind me whose bastards were killing peaceful civilians right before my very eyes?"
507319, "I have business to discuss with you."
507320, "Well, we're all businesspeople here! Speak up, mate."
507328, "I need a weapon, Grief."
507329, "Everybody needs a weapon. Gotta million? We'd even get you somethin' that shoots for a million. There ought to be a gun somewhere around, eh? Just one, pretty please? But everythin' has its price."
507330, "A million? That price tag befits an artillery mortar, mate."
507331, "Oh no, my lovely man, the mortar is a gift, it is. You can't go shootin' them robbers in a dark alley with a mortar. A barker, on the other hand... But it would probably cost you even more dearly, dear doc..."
507332, "Andrey is off to the kennel, Grief."
507335, "Grief, what's going on in the Termitary?"
507336, "Quite the contrary, doc, quite the contrary. I'd buy them drugs for sure, just bring me some... See how everything's goin' around here-and you want to rob us of pills? You do not have my consent to that. They'll save us from the fever."
507337, "What, you mean you'd buy any pills?"
507338, "Well, no, I'm not an idiot, mate. The sovereign ones. Words get 'round, y'know; everyone knows what works and what doesn't. I'm warnin' you, the demand for those is huge like a bull. If you need ammo though, I could see to that no problem. Nothing's too good for my dear man."
507341, "I'll keep that in mind."
507342, "You sly weasel..."
507343, "Sell them to me, Grief. You've got no use for them anyway."
507345, "What the hell? What is this mould?"
507346, "I keep hearing children's voices... The girls are crying, and the boy is laughing... We mustn't scare them... Don't tell them and don't let them in here..."
507347, "You're delirious. There is no one here."
507348, "You will be rewarded for this. Give me something... I can't stand the pain any longer..."
507349, "Wait here, I'll come back."
507350, "I'm a doctor. Let me examine you."
507351, "Don't come close. We are dying already. I told my sisters not to go outside... So they're... shambling... around the house..."
507352, "All right. Hold on, I'll get help."
507353, "I'll be back."
507354, "Take the key. You'll be able to open the door if we lose consciousness..."
507355, "Hold on."
507356, "Lie still!"
507357, "Who's shambling around the house? And why?"
507358, "Make them stop following me then! Why are they constantly at my heels? They are supposed to be lying down!"
507359, "You amaze me, Bachelor. Did you not make fun of the shabnak rumours yesterday? Mind you, there was some factual basis for all the hearsay. A lot of people don't have the faintest idea of what kinds of life may be found deep in the Steppe. They don't even know what kind of people live there; what kind of food they eat; what kind of effigies they make out of clay... Neither do you, to be fair. Still, you don't hesitate a moment to accept a rumour of an epidemic as veritable truth. Is the concept of the disease that much more familiar to you than that of a maneating abomination made of clay?"
507360, "It's simply because my head is screwed on right, dammit. Do you trust Rubin's opinion?"
507361, "This is most surprising. I haven't seen him since we last spoke, even though he said he would come. Why would he go into hiding? And where did he take the body he was examining? After all, why would he be so intent on avoiding any contact with you? "
507362, "Okay, now I'm confused."
507363, "...Let us get back to more pressing matters then. Here, take the money. I am not so eager to give everything I have to alleviate the outbreak, because I've yet to see any proof that the outbreak is real. But I am well aware of the reality of Lara's drastic circumstances. I will embrace the opportunity, however slim. Hopefully, at least part of the money will be used for purposes other than this shelter she has conceived of."
507364, "This is exactly the kind of blindness that kills people during emergencies. Thank you for the donation."
507365, "There have been quite a few deaths recently."
507366, "That is terrible. All these years I was unable to fathom how porous the boundary between the bestial and the humane is. Porous if not altogether ethereal."
507367, "Indeed it is."
507368, "Mankind is the apex of creation because we are free. Animals don't even have an option."
507369, "This is debatable."
507370, "Yet now is not the time to get into this argument."
507371, "Thank you, Yulia."
507372, "No. All I did was sensibly evaluate the probability of both versions."
507373, "Victoria, I need your help."
507374, "I was actually about to share this with you! Little kids come to me in flocks from throughout the town. They are all scared. The youngest are afraid of shabnak. The older ones tell me that there is something wrong with certain houses. And who knows what's inside?"
507376, "I'll go see her if I have the time."
507377, "...What will become of us?"
507378, "...I can't believe my ears. Someone has admitted that I am right."
507379, "We need to buy emergency rations. A lot of them. It will be a challenge even today-but I fear that tomorrow it will simply become unfeasible."
507380, "How much do you need?"
507381, "We need a lot. I want at least twelve people to be able to survive for a month in the house that will become a shelter. With minimal expenses, of course. My friends and those who help me set the place up will be accepted in."
507382, "And what did you do to make that happen?"
507383, "I've collected all the money I could find. I've sent couriers on a shopping mission-trying to find the best prices. Now I need to collect the most important donations, from the Kains and the Olgimskys. Yulia agreed to make a donation too. I'm going to see them now, and then I'll join this crazy shop rush..."
507384, "Yes, it's absolutely absurd. I think the prices have gone up threefold."
507386, "Can I become one of these people?"
507387, "Of course."
507388, "What do I need to do?"
507389, "I do. But I'm used to doing everything myself, and I don't really have a choice right now."
507390, "I will make the purchases. I have to do a lot of walking today anyway. Tell me what you need."
507391, "Still, you shouldn't risk your life unnecessarily-better rely on your couriers."
507392, "Where can I find the best prices at the moment?"
507393, "I've heard some shops are planning to sell stuff for bargain prices from time to time. Ask the townsfolk, they should know."
507394, "This work is neither very time-consuming nor mundane. And it's definitely more than a mere errand. It's a very important mission."
507395, "I see."
507396, "Thank you. I'll come by to see you soon."
507397, "Yes."
507398, "You need to bring it over to the empty house in the Flank. I showed you the way before, remember? My friends and an intendant that had helped us with the shopping are waiting there already."
507399, "I'll be back soon."
507400, "Your stare is no velvet either."
507401, "Then why do you believe me?"
507402, "Me? I'm just not questioning anything. I'm not allowed to. If you want to know why I decided to give Lara my savings, I'll tell you this: that is because I'm compelled to. By the way, have you found the proof you were looking for?"
507403, "I'd rather you never did, en-Daniil..."
507404, "Too good to come true."
507405, "I was planning to speak to your father in any case."
507406, "Why?"
507407, "What's wrong with them leaving?"
507408, "Why?"
507409, "There can be many reasons..."
507410, "His way of thinking is provocation enough. What else do people hate each other for?"
507411, "For the structure on the other side of the river."
507412, "People never hate geniuses more passionately than they crave them. Some would kill Peter. The rest are probably quietly suffering seeing him sink his talent in twyre vodka."
507413, "I see."
507414, "Why did you ask about Peter?"
507415, "Curious... You know, this gave me an interesting idea-because the last thing I want is for him to die."
507416, "Don't even think about it! If they try to leave secretly, they will regret it. Andrey will be the first to. The great architects who once chose this town as their creative laboratory will not leave it at a time like this. Tell them both that if they do not wish to drink the cup of Nina Kaina's daughter's wrath, they will sit quietly at home! Both of them."
507417, "I thought they were free people and had the right to do as they please."
507418, "Whoa..."
507419, "Indeed... And Lara is a generous and selfless girl with a tragic fate... I will support her, of course. I'll send her some money tomorrow."
507420, "Was he executed? I thought he had died in battle."
507421, "After the Battle of the Fords he was executed by firing squad along with other deserters. I still can't believe it. Captain Ravel has always been a man of rare courage. He enlisted in the Fourth Army as a volunteer. He was a staunch-one might even say fanatical-supporter of general Block. It's a strange story."
507422, "I have come here at her behest. I'm afraid that every minute counts in a situation we've found ourselves in. The shops are running out of food as we speak. We must urgently buy the little that's left. Prices are growing rapidly."
507423, "Fine."
507424, "I see. Right now I can only give you some of the little we have left. Our family's funds are exhausted. I regret it, but that is directly related to my brother Simon's examination and burial."
507425, "Thank you."
507426, "I didn't know that."
507427, "Lara doesn't know that either. She's been told that her father died as a hero at the Karstov Fords. And you know what? Somehow I've got the feeling that that's exactly what happened..."
507428, "I won't tell her anything, of course."
507429, "They say you've seen a Silent House."
507430, "Let me take a look... Turn around."
507431, "Haven't changed your mind, have you?"
507432, "No."
507433, "I have news for you. This evening Alexander Saburov will become the governor. Olgimsky and Kain are going to vest him nearly unrestricted powers to curb the epidemic that your brother and you refuse to believe in."
507435, "I am."
507436, "What of Georgiy? What does the Judge say? Bloody hell... So Saburov will be the judge now too?"
507437, "Definitely."
507438, "That's it, I'm a dead man. As luck would have it...  it happens exactly when I'm about to create a truly glorious masterpiece... Fine. Let us go."
507439, "So I'm telling Andrey you've agreed."
507440, "How can anyone be sure of anything these days?"
507441, "I don't think so; but he'll have the right to execute anyone whom he considers to be guilty of breaking the quarantine."
507442, "But why?"
507443, "Can't you see what I've managed to build here? Where else would I be allowed to do something like this? Everything that I have ever called my purpose has been brought to life in this town. For now, I have no reason to leave it. I haven't finished my observations yet. I'm this close to figuring it out..."
507444, "What are you talking about?"
507445, "...You wouldn't understand. You've never built anything."
507446, "You're wrong. I've built Thanatica and created the groundbreaking theory of human mortality."
507447, "In that case forgive me. But then it's puzzling you don't understand me. You are prepared to risk your life for your lifework, aren't you?"
507448, "Yes, of course I am."
507449, "Damn it, you pighead!"
507450, "Why is this place so special?"
507451, "Does twyrine protect from this disease?"
507452, "The right one, the so-called 'tear', does. Thick infusions and twyrine sap do not. It doesn't matter, I'm staying here all the same."
507453, "Can't you get twyrine someplace else?"
507472, "Soul-and-a-Half commander-in-chief salutes death fighter commander-in-chief! News report: situation slowly returning to normal."
507515, "I am not going to discuss that. I can only sympathize with you and advise you against disturbing my father with this question."
507516, "I don't like this."
507517, "I see."
507521, ""
507522, "Bachelor Dankovsky, sir? I'm under the orders to stop you by any and all means necessary. No one is allowed to leave the town. This is the order of the emergency plenipotentiary."
507523, "You moron! The emergency plenipotentiary is me! Make way!"
507524, "Fine, you win. I will cancel my departure."
507525, ""
507526, "Corporal of the guard, is that you? Change-over? The sergeant's over there, by the machine."
507527, "I see..."
507528, "Yes... so does mine. This damn air of yours."
507529, "Those are tree branches."
507530, "Are you implying I owe you something?"
507531, "I don't have time for that."
507532, "Ah, it's nothing. I just need a little rest."
507533, "And hopefully not unpleasant."
507534, "I will when you grow taller than that Polyhedron of yours."
507535, "I've said all I wanted to say."
507536, "There is always hope."
507538, "Everything is changing-for the better."
507627, "I am counting on you, doctor."
507629, "Which of the locals could help me? Whose words can be trusted?"
507630, "Do you trust this Rubin?"
507631, "I would trust Rubin with my life. A competent medic of remarkable courage and laudable integrity. Everything he does is done with appropriate diligence and care. He doesn't like people that much, but he is eager to serve them. Why do you ask?"
507632, "Oh, one more thing... I'd like to examine your brother's body."
507633, "I just wonder what kind of man he is... How do I get to know him?"
507643, "Why didn't you send for Isidor himself?"
507644, "He wasn't home. In fact, he was nowhere to be found. Isidor Burakh has disappeared."
507645, "Strange..."
507646, "I would suspect foul play, but Burakh is known to disappear in such a manner. Sometimes he's gone for several days, sometimes for several weeks. Rumour has it that he explores the Steppe - going as far as the herdsmen's landings by the Eghe-Gola rise."
507647, "I would still like to take a look at your brother. I made a long journey for this."
507648, "Thank you."
507649, "I personally asked him to come no later than midnight. Don't let it worry you."
507650, "Hmm, it seems you are not in too much of a hurry to ascertain the details of your brother's death..."
507658, "No matter what happens, the truth will be revealed in the end."
507744, "No need to be so scared."
507745, "Fine, I'll help you. I've managed to find the time."
507746, "We'll simply have to get by."
507747, "Nothing good, believe me."
507752, "Nevermind. This is enough."
507753, "Really? Why?"
507754, "He has his own opinion on the matter. I think he accepts that you might be right-he accepts it, but he won't admit it. See the difference? Obviously, getting solid proof is disadvantageous to him for some reason. Not to mention that it would immediately cause him expenses..."
507777, "Oh... judging by how your family's acting, you can't."
507778, "Simon Kain, the man of improper longevity, is waiting for me here. I hope he sympathizes with my request. I only need a living evidence of the impossible... "
508097, "We, the Kains, have always been out of touch with mundane reality, but we are driven by love. Love can be furious, funny, and blind, but there's never a need to make excuses for it, is there?"
508111, "So Georgiy is your uncle? Somehow he looks like a grandfather to you."
508125, "My uncle is a Judge. He was a Judge and he will remain that. People come to him rather than Saburov to settle disputes."
508411, "So you have agreed to help us?"
508412, "Could he have been poisoned?"
508413, "No. He hadn't eaten or drunk anything for several days. And prior to that, he'd only drunk wine from the old household stock. He would open the bottles himself."
508414, "What made him take such precautions?"
508415, "...I've never really thought about it. Indeed... But were they precautions at all? He was always conducting experiments on himself. Not only on his body, but on his time, his language, his way of thinking... Even his fate."
508416, "Could his death have been the outcome of one of such experiments?"
508417, "I think, between me and you, that this is precisely what my brother Georgiy fears. I can say nothing more about that."
508418, "So this could have been suicide?"
508419, "I don't think so. It's nearly an impossibility... But I don't have the right to tell you anything! My brother doesn't want us Kains to affect your line of thinking by giving you our interpretation of the facts."
508420, "Could the murderer have already been waiting for Simon there?"
508421, "No. You have no concept of what the Focus is. Entering it is like entering someone else's mind, or a drawn picture if you will. It's impossible."
508422, "What's this Focus place?"
508428, "It's hard to explain... It's his study, if you will. An extraordinarily spacious creative laboratory. Almost perfectly sealed off-except for the door that was visible at all times. Metaphorically speaking."
508429, "I don't understand."
508430, "Well, Simon did somehow, didn't he?"
508431, "He could perform far more impressive feats. There's a reason why the whole town reveres... I mean, revered him."
508432, "Tell me honestly, dear Victor... Did Simon exist at all?"
508433, "Bravo, doctor! There is indeed a spark of genius to you. Alas... yes. Yes, he did."
508434, "'Alas'?"
508435, "It's not that I would benefit from his death. Alas-for that would be too simple an explanation. Simon well and truly did exist. That is exactly what's left everyone in disarray; it was so hard for them to accept his existence that the thought of his demise is now driving them mad."
508436, "Fair enough. What do you want from me, then?"
508437, "You're not going to believe it. For my creations! The Downgate, the Alley of Heroes ensemble, The Other Stairway Round. The House House was specifically renounced by the World Association of Architects. Even though it's always been my little brother and me... I am usually the one to take the beating."
508438, "Really? I didn't even know all those things were your works. It's an honour to meet you!"
508439, "Can she really predict the future?"
508440, "She sees... the vague features... and she always speaks the truth, just like a true Mistress ought to."
508441, "I see."
508442, "I can hardly believe that."
508443, "My name is Daniil. Daniil Dankovsky."
508444, "Well, yes. I'm the mistress of this house, after all. That doesn't mean I'm a Mistress, mind you, not with a capital 'M'... I won't ever become one. But I can also serve people to the best of my ability."
508445, "Nice to meet a person of a sceptical mind. I am Vladislav Olgimsky. The younger one, of course. And you are, of course, Daniil Dankovsky."
508446, "Yes, that is me."
508447, "Nice to meet you."
508448, "I have."
508449, "May I ask why?"
508451, "The killer's goals seem to align astonishingly well with the goals of those who've been waging war against my work for years."
508452, "We share a tragedy. I want to exact vengeance upon the one that robbed me and my work of a future."
508453, "I want to solve a puzzle. I even like having so little information. It's a challenge to my intellect."
508454, "I'm prepared to answer any questions you may have."
508456, "Why not?"
508457, "It will benefit us too much if Simon's death is interpreted in... a certain fashion. And damage us too much if it's interpreted in a certain other fashion. I will not elaborate on that."
508460, "It's like an equation. Or a mirror puzzle. Anyway, the murderer could not have been hiding there. Take my word for it."
508463, "I'm still thinking it over."
508464, "In that case I don't have the right to reveal the details. If you change your mind... I will be prepared to answer any questions. And please inform Georgiy if you do... He is putting too much hope in you."
508465, "I know."
508628, "The mysterious Maria, Victor Kain's daughter, has been expecting my arrival for several days. She seems to know more about me than I do."
508629, "This is where Victor lives, the youngest of the three Kain brothers. He can tell me more about Simon's manner of death."
508630, "This mansion, called the Stillwater, belongs to a single girl called Eva Yan. An accidental midnight encounter provided me with a lovely companion and temporary lodging."
508631, "Simon is dead. His brother Georgiy is preparing to take the empty throne of the clan's leader. The Kains are obsessed with the idea of finding the murderer. They don't seem to be driven by rancour, but rather by the desire to uncover a mystery..."
508632, "The Rod. The Saburovs have been living here since the town was founded. Once a mighty and powerful clan, it only has two persons now: a governor devoid of any real authority and his dying wife."
508633, "This is the Lump, the mansion belonging to the Olgimskys-a family of factory owners. The fifty-year-old Vladislav, its housefather, is called Vlad the Heavy by the locals for his bad temper."
508634, "The Willows serves as the residence for a singer called Anna-her last name, Angel, has a curious ring to it. Yulia believes that the suspected murderer may be hiding here."
508635, "Getting rid of the bodies is an emotional and troublesome business. Grace, a young girl and the muse of the cemetery, can help Anna Angel arrange that."
508636, "The intelligent Yulia lives here. She may be my only ally in my attempt to put the fairy-tales of this backwards place to the test of algebra and physics..."
508637, "This is where Isidor Burakh lives, the man that had brought me to this remote place. He is the last person that saw Simon Kain alive."
508638, "Hoping to find Eva, Andrey went to the marsh, to check with the Worms."
508639, "My new friend turned out to be both well-known and well-informed. Yulia insists I consult her when I meet a dead end."
508640, "The owner of this house, Katerina Saburova, has something crucial to tell me."
508641, "A runaway burcher, that according to the rumours is likely to be the maneater, has found shelter here. I should interrogate the suspect before the eccentric Kains get to him."
508642, "Vlad the Younger is more than eager to get rid of some beastlike troublemaker. I wonder what the creature whose murder would not be considered a crime looks like?"
508643, "Worms, the twyre gatherers, are likely to know who Burakh had sold his concoctions to... "
508644, "Worms, the twyre gatherers, are likely to know who Burakh had sold his concoctions to... "
508645, "Anna Angel keeps a considerable amount of medical supplies. I should talk her into donating part of the stock to public needs."
508646, "Lara Ravel lives here. According to Yulia Lyuricheva, a decent amount of local social events revolve around the girl. Her connections may prove to be invaluable."
508647, "Why would anyone choose such a remote shack as their regular place of residence? Vlad the Younger is in no hurry to return home-and I strongly doubt his actions are motivated purely by the desire to live independently of his fierce father..."
508648, "The hooks to Aspity's heart are at Vlad the Younger's."
508649, "Time to have a closer look at the monstrous Aspity. Now I know how to hook her good conscience..."
508689, "So the merchant's son prefers a disheveled shack by the railroad to his father's manor. A rather peculiar choice..."
508690, "Okay, so I will help you. Too many women were killed today based on these absurd suspicions."
508691, "So you do believe that I'm not to blame for this man's death?"
508692, "If anyone finds out there's a dead man in your house, it would do you no good."
508736, ""
508737, "Dear colleague! By some happy coincidence I managed to get my hands on a certain... vessel, that I believe I can recover the pathogen from. Which means we are now all set to research the vaccine! But, odd as it may sound, I'd rather avoid tapping into that... source I mentioned, unless I absolutely have to. I'd rather examine the samples that can be procured from the dead tissue."
508739, "That's impossible..."
508740, "You will soon get used to how many things in this town would commonly be described as impossible. This is not what matters, anyway. We were unable to nip the outbreak in the bud, but if the disease we're looking at is indeed the Sand Plague-we will be able to fight it."
508746, "You seem to have a solution already."
508747, "...We can try to cure Simon. If we cure him, we cure the town. I do not make much difference between the town and Simon, and neither does anyone here. Next point: to get this chimera of a sickness out of his chimera of a body, we need to research it first. Are we on the same page?"
508748, "To isolate a chimera is to do the impossible. Especially in these conditions."
508749, "Precisely, colleague. You took the words out of my mouth. It's almost impossible, but still worth a try! After all, Master succeded in doing just that. I'll try to extract the microbial culture from the tissue by means of traditional chemistry. All I need from you is to help me get enough samples of dead tissue."
508751, "I was going to ask you to bring a sample or two from one of the infected quarters. Be doubly careful though, and make sure to get the dissection fully cleared with one of the rulers, else the risk would be twice as high as needs be. I'd go myself, but there are reasons that make it impossible for me to leave Simon's body unattended."
508752, "That's some request... What is this additional danger you speak of?"
508753, "Do pay a visit to governor Saburov. I wouldn't go to Vlad if I were you, he's too resourceful, and too inclined to drag you into his schemes... The Kains are also out of the question as anything that leads Georgiy to me would likely result in Simon's body being removed. And I still have a lot of work to do."
508754, "Sounds reasonable. I'll see you soon."
508757, "That's not so difficult, as it is, but to take samples I need syringes, sterile containers, ice packs... I see none of those here."
508758, "As they searched for Isidor's killer, these savages wrought havok on what laboratory equipment we had. And, after the rumours of your discovery reached the townsfolk, most medicants and reagents were stolen. Regrettably, I was unable to control it."
508759, "You do understand that this makes further work impossible, don't you?"
508760, "We need to investigate the matter, apprehend the looters, and recover the medicine! This is a small town, the scoundrels should be easy enough to find."
508761, "Ugh... I need some time to think it over. Dissecting corpses befits medical students, and I'm no longer one of those."
508762, "You are still not entirely honest with me! You are not really going to cure him, are you?"
508763, "We don't have anything to enable this kind of procedure. All we have here is this... 'equipment'... of yours, so to speak."
508764, "Simon Kain, the immortal man... the keeper of the town... Huh."
508765, "I'm sure Georgiy will be very happy to hear that. What do you think?"
508766, "I wouldn't hurry to let him know, doctor. Georgiy is an artisan, but not a sage. His anger cannot be contained. If he learns that his brother is alive, he will never allow us to complete what we've started. He will take the body from us and we won't be able to further our studies. Our research will be jeopardised."
508767, "Are you going to research this... phenomenon? Or were you talking about the disease?"
508768, "I'm a bachelor. I'm not a doctor. The way things are looking, I won't ever become one."
508769, "What kind of relationship you have with the Kains, colleague?"
508770, "Friendly, I would say."
508771, "I'd say our relationship is rather tense."
508772, "Is that so? They don't seem to know anything about it. Both Georgiy and Victor speak of you with sympathy and respect. I was told they treat you like a friend; a brother; a son... Some people go as far as to say they will make you heir to their family!"
508773, "I will rectify this mistake in due time. What was it you were going to tell me?"
508774, "I need to confide in you, then, if you agree to listen to my somewhat harrowing confession. I urge you to hear me out; the fate of the town depends on it, as does our possible victory over the disease."
508775, "Go ahead."
508776, "The body of Simon is the source from where I get the bacteria. The pathogen survives within him because... because Simon is still alive. He is lethargic.. or something to that effect. His body carries all visible signs of the Sand Pest, even his skin has discoloured. But he isn't dead."
508777, "Wait a moment... How can we possibly produce a vaccine with what scarce equipment we have?"
508778, "Unfortunately, there are only twenty four hours in a day... We don't have much time."
508779, "The infected quarter is hell on earth. It's absolutely impossible to survive there. Do you have any antibiotics at all? Any kind of immune system stimulants?"
508780, "You are still not being entirely sincere with me, colleague. Tell me about Simon."
508781, "Where is Simon, colleague?"
508782, "I keep him at an ice cellar, not far from here."
508783, "Why don't you give the body back to the Kains?"
508784, "Because I'm not done with it yet! Besides, I am all alone here. The moment I had an opportunity to send a message outside, I used it to bring you here. Your presence is more important than other considerations right now. Would you kindly hear what my request is?"
508785, "What do you want to ask of me?"
508786, "It won't be a vaccine per se, but rather a solution that might temporarily bolster the immune system. True, I don't have much in the way of equipment, but I have plenty of reagents, herbal tinctures... twyrine infusions, by and large. The least we can expect is to keep ourselves reasonably safe until a better equipped team arrives."
508787, "Where are we going to get the dead tissue from?"
508790, "Find someone else to obtain the samples! Our job is to study the specimen under the microscope, not to cut it out in some seedy alley!"
508791, "Believe me, I tried my best. No one wants anything to do with the mutilation of dead bodies. Isidor's students have gone into hiding. I planned to approach the butchers, but Olgimsky has blocked off the Termitary. I would search for a stray butcher in town, there may be some, but I can't leave Simon's body. There is no one who would do it for us right now."
508792, "Very well. I got agitated beyond reason. I'll bring you the sample."
508793, "I will keep working until we are able to isolate the microbe. I don't understand why we can't see the culture yet? There are traces aplenty, but not the bacteria themselves."
508794, "Let us keep searching."
508795, "Shall we perhaps invite an infected person right here?"
508796, "Out of the question. Without anything to protect ourselves, we will surely die. In fact, developing these means of protection is precisely the purpose of our unpleasant and criminal work."
508797, "You're right... There must be some other option."
508798, "I heard a rumour of a man who is well-equipped to both dissect the dead and gut the living. In fact, he's the son of the deceased healer, your Master. Did you get to meet him?"
508799, "I didn't. A few of my friends are trying to find him on my behalf, with no success yet."
508800, "That's unfortunate. I will try to think of some other option. See you soon, colleague."
508801, "I'm sure that whenever they find him, he will prove to be very helpful indeed. This is, after all, his line of occupation. He's bound to do a better job than I ever could. As for me, I've had enough of that already."
508802, "Perhaps we should switch places?"
508803, "Would you be able to apply herbal tinctures to the specimen? To prepare the reagents; to adjust their potency? Working with herbs requires knowledge and experience-and we have nothing but herbs to work with. Besides, the Kains hold me personally responsible for my precious patient."
508804, "Very well. How many samples do you need?"
508808, "Dissection of dead bodies is something that the locals strongly disapprove of. For Steppe people, the human body represents the world. Only a member of a special taglur-Burakh, to name one-is allowed to 'open it up'. This is a caste-based privilege, you see."
508809, "Does everyone in the town share this same prejudice?"
508810, "No, of course not. But even those who are oblivious of the sacred meaning of the Kin's rituals would still oppose unsanctioned dissection, because it's traditionally inappropriate. A cultural taboo, if you will. An autopsy performed by anyone other than a true born menkhu is seen as blasphemy of the worst kind. Even incest is not as repulsive to them."
508811, "Which doesn't stop them from being comfortable with all manner of slaughter."
508812, "These people are outlaws, and not a single one of them is a Steppe man."
508813, "So what am I supposed to do?"
508814, "Ahem... I had no idea..."
508815, "I want to see what the disease can do to human internal organs. I need more time for that; I didn't even perform an autopsy yet."
508816, "I see."
508817, "And I thought you wanted to see if Simon has the same anatomy as a regular human being."
508818, "Well... the initial diagnosis was supported. There is no doubt Simon died to Sand Plague."
508819, "And yet you're still studying the body. Why?"
508820, "You see through me, Bachelor. This is, indeed, my purpose, and this is the reason why I cannot give back the body. I hope you won't tell the Kains where I am."
508821, "I won't. I'd be interested to know what the autopsy will reveal."
508822, "I doubt I will be able to lie if the Kains ask me directly."
508823, "I urge you not to do it. Simon is the key to our salvation; we need to study him as much as possible. Don't throw the opportunity away."
508824, "You demand that I enter an agreement with my own conscience, Rubin."
508826, "I do. In circumstances such as these, we have to sacrifice everything for the common good."
508827, "Very well. I won't tell them anything."
508828, "I'll think about it."
508829, "None whatsoever. I don't have any medicine here. Truth be told, this is one of the reasons I would prefer not to enter the infected quarter myself."
508830, "Now, that's unfortunate..."
508831, "Rumour has it that the Olgimskys have organised the distribution of medicine among a few of the more important townspeople. I had to stay here in hiding, so I did not get any of that. But, some of the people you've come to know here will be only too happy to help."
508832, "Good thinking. I'll follow your advice."
508833, ""
508835, "The disease is spreading quickly. The neighbouring district is almost entirely steeped in infection by now. And even though the Powers That Be have informed me that help is on the way, I doubt that they're aware of the rate of spread... But let's not lose hope. What are you working on now?"
508836, "I intend to start studying the pathologic culture now. Which is why I'd like to ask for your help."
508837, "What kind of help can I offer you?"
508839, "Vlad Olgimsky is in charge of this matter. He has agreed to provide funds and manpower. Talk to him. "
508840, "I need to work with dead bodies. I was told that this work demands your sanction. Is that true?"
508841, "I regret to say that no one can help you here. Local superstition prohibits any violation of a body's integrity. Add a cult of the dead on top... If they see you dissecting a corpse, they might tear you to pieces. It has already happened once."
508842, "It's essential for my work. "
508843, "I understand, but there's nothing I can do. Let us pretend this conversation never happened. You might want to turn to your new acquaintances. As far as I can judge, they are ready to do anything you ask."
508844, "I'll do that then. I should hope the infected districts have already reconsidered this reactionary, prejudiced stance!"
508845, "I'd rather turn to someone educated."
508846, "How was such a bizarre tradition born? "
508847, "I am not the best expert on the Kin. Ask the residents of the Earth district, I'm sure they can tell you more. Although they are not particularly talkative... Ask Big Vlad. He has promised to assist you in every way... the cunning hypocrite!"
508848, "Very well. But I don't need dead tissues for my own entertainment; I need them in order to fight the disease!"
508849, "I need equipment. I've found out by chance that Isidor's laboratory was ransacked during the recent riots. I'd be grateful if you found the perpetrators and confiscated what they had looted."
508850, "Yes, I've heard that. They're already being investigated. However, I would not call Burakh's dwelling a laboratory... It was more of a workshop. There weren't many valuables there. Still, I will let you know when the stolen items are recovered."
508851, "Thank you. "
508852, "This and that... I'm conducting certain observations. "
508853, "That is my private business, ruler. "
508854, "We are doing worse than ever. The infection is spreading!"
508855, "What makes you say that?"
508856, "Where will the hospital be set up? "
508857, "What about burials? Who has assumed responsibility for burying the deceased?"
508858, "The volunteers don't see a danger there for now. The townspeople are coping on their own. Why does that interest you?"
508859, "I need tissue samples from someone who died of the Sand Fever."
508860, "This difficulty could be resolved by some rather sinister people... I am talking about butchers. Butchers, rather obviously, have no qualms about cutting bodies. Tradition gives them a hereditary right to perform this sacred act. "
508861, "What do you personally think about it? "
508862, "I don't share the views of the Steppe people. As a former military man, I regard the taboo against dissecting bodies as mere prejudice. But I wouldn't like my reputation in the town to be that of a blasphemer. If someone finds out that I've given you permission to autopsy a corpse, I am doomed."
508863, "Then what am I supposed to bloody do?"
508864, "I've yet to see a single butcher in this town."
508865, "Of course. Olgimsky had them locked up after another of their strikes. However, it is said that on the eve of the blockade, a group of butchers did not make it back to the Termitary on time. Someone is hiding them... There is a house here in Earth whose dwellers know who it is. Take a chance."
508866, "Thank you. Excellent advice. "
508867, "Listen, governor. I don't intend to offend anyone's sensibilities. It's the common good that requires your tradition to be violated just this once."
508868, ""
508869, "Please touch me-do I have a fever?"
508870, "I know everything."
508871, "So?"
508872, "The infection goes straight to the head. It talks to you a bit with this little inner voice, and then it moves in completely. For a while. The tenant is rather troublesome, and the body makes for a lousy lodging-it breaks apart all too easily. And so the disease leaves it and moves along to find someone else."
508873, "'Moves in'? What do you mean?"
508874, "It listens to your thoughts, peeks inside you, takes a nice look, and moves in. But! The check-in only happens after a very short and crucial interview. It'll only move in if it fancies you, otherwise you may keep on with your plain boring life. But making it fancy you is easy, it doesn't really discriminate, as you can see."
508875, "Did it speak to you too?"
508876, "I think it did, it's just that I was unlucky."
508877, "My condolences."
508878, "Thanks for the discussion. You're an engaging conversationalist."
508879, "Very poetic. Very far from the truth."
508880, "Poetry aside, sounds plausible."
508881, "Who said anything about poetry? You're missing the point. It doesn't touch the next person as long as it's comfortable with the current one."
508882, "You said it goes to the head. What did you mean?"
508883, "Who told you that?"
508884, "Internal relations, Bachelor. You wouldn't understand-I can visualize this crazy gallop. If you manage to distract it, make it shift its attention to others, you'll live. When the Sand Pest starts talking to you, pretend to be someone else, and you'll trick it."
508885, "I'll keep this in mind."
508886, "But that would be a rather mean trick, wouldn't it?"
508887, "Everything in the world?"
508888, "Do you know anything about how the disease is transmitted?"
508889, "You are concealing runaway butchers in this very house, Aspity."
508890, "Well, crucify me! What's this about? Running more errands for the Olgimskys?"
508891, "No. This time I've come on my own accord. I need your help. "
508892, "Well, I gotta hear that. Why on earth would the wise serpent seek anyone's help...?"
508893, "Indeed. They want the heads of everyone you're hiding."
508894, "I need the tissue of a Sand Plague victim."
508895, "You can only find dead victims in the infected houses. Since you appear to be alive, you have never entered a single one of them. You will have five to ten minutes if you do-then the infection strikes. With the expected results."
508896, "Perhaps you could find a single runaway that would agree to help? What would he want in return?"
508897, "How about I make you all comply by force?"
508898, "Brute force won't help you in the slightest. They've got nothing to lose. I mean, sure, do bring the thugs, welcome! We'll meet you with proper respect and due ceremonies, as long as you manage to break the door. Now get lost-and never ever come back here as the Olgimskys' errand boy."
508899, "Make ready for the ceremonies then."
508900, "We'll see how it goes."
508901, "Perhaps I could find a lot of runaways that would agree to help if only I ask them to. And the same me will ask you for a favour then. Will you do me one?"
508902, "It depends on what you're planning to ask."
508903, "I will. Go ahead and speak."
508904, "You're influential with Olgimsky. Use that influence. Tell him to stop persecuting the runaways. It's no longer a revenge situation-but he's still all too eager... Takes the guy quite some time to calm down, huh? Anyway. If he swears to leave alone the butchers that are now outside the Termitary, I'll talk three runaways into risking their lives. It's not like they have anything to lose anyway."
508905, "I'll try. "
508906, "No, that I won't do. I'll deal with the situation without you."
508908, "Big Vlad agrees. He swore that from this point on not a single runaway in the town would be killed on his orders."
508909, "Proof? "
508910, "My word. And Vlad's word too, of course. Right now he's in no position to break his promise. He is also persecuted."
508913, "It's already done. The orders have been issued for Saburov's patrolmen and the Olgimsky's men. Sealed and delivered."
508914, "...Fine then. I'll send three butchers to the infected Skinners. They'll be waiting for you there-if they manage to find a dead body, cut it, and survive to see you, that is. Follow them in an hour. They may die before you reach them, so waste no time."
508916, "Why do you want them to split?"
508917, "That enhances the chance of success, doesn't it? Also these three butchers I fancy the least."
508918, "It would make sense for me to go with them straight away then, wouldn't it?"
508919, "Only the shabnak cut the dead open-and does it even matter whose hand holds the knife? What matters is who's given out the order. Or do you think people won't realize who's violating the dead if you simply keep quiet and stand to the side?"
508920, "Sounds convincing."
508921, "I say... "
508922, "I strongly advise you to conduct reconnaissance before you go to the infected district. Prepare for the field trip well... Rumour has it, the place leaves you less chances than a mincing machine would. The patrolmen guarding the infected houses have already consumed half the confiscated drugs."
508923, "Thank you, Aspity."
508924, "Don't you teach me how to do my job."
508925, ""
508926, "The Skinners... Yes... That was one nasty day, wouldn't you agree?"
508927, "We're already busy starting it. Do you want to know more? Is that the only reason why you came?"
508928, "Yes. Please tell me what measures you have taken. "
508929, "Do you think we ought to report to you, my dear doctor? Although there's nothing to hide... Our town has no suitable buildings... Someone suggested we found a hospital in an abandoned house, but the conditions... "
508930, "Who cares about the conditions? We need a hospital urgently. We need it right now. Where are the patients taken to? "
508931, "To the cemetery, dear doctor. The mortality rate is absolute. You're supposed to know that better than anyone-including me. The dying need only water and morphine. Sometimes vodka too. They can depart to the better world painlessly then. "
508932, "That doesn't release us from the obligation to build a hospital. Report to me as soon as the facility is equipped. "
508933, "Does that mean that you've already established the supply of the substances required? Vodka, water, and morphine... I'm afraid that won't be enough."
508934, "Be so kind as to do the following: Check every warehouse and every store that may still have medicine left. Confiscate everything you find. I'll check what we have in stock and choose the appropriate remedies."
508935, "It's not a trivial task, doctor..."
508936, "Which is why I have to resort to you personal power... and the opportunities it provides."
508937, "If it was easy, I would have done it myself. "
508938, "What about the conditions? "
508939, "It turned out to be very tricky to provide the patients with water. You may not have been told about it, but the water supply has been blocked and partially destroyed. Rumour has it that the water intake and even the river are already contaminated... Barrels are the only source of drinking water right now. "
508940, "Where are the patients taken to?"
508941, "No. As far as I understand, you are the person that keeps the native population in check-and that is why I need you. Most of your workers are from the Steppe, aren't they? "
508942, "Let me put it this way, I have a certain influence on them... Yet the only thing in charge of the Kin is the Kin itself... Keeping it in check is no easier than managing a community of... silkworms or termites. The Foreman of the Abattoir knows how to do it-to a certain extent... But why do you ask?"
508943, "I need to work with dead bodies. Since I still haven't been provided a place to keep my research uninterrupted, I need to find out a way to deal with this issue."
508944, "The dead bodies are already being worked with. The person who's doing it will be eager to share the results with you. Look for him in the disease hotbeds-most likely he has already gone there."
508945, "Thank you for the advice. "
508946, "Who is it? And how do l recognize him? "
508947, "He stands out from the crowd, my friend... You will know him at once. He is quiet-unlike the others... and has a Steppe phenotype. There's a deep wrinkle on his forehead. He'll wear protective garments... I bet they'll be stained... with blood. "
508948, "Right, I guess it won't be too hard to find a person with such obvious features."
508949, "I'm happy to relieve your mind, doctor. We're distributing protective and preventative drugs daily among the townsfolk. Even the antibiotics... We've selected the drug agents from the list you gave us yesterday. Are you satisfied?"
508950, "Quite. "
508951, "Well. I am glad you've finally given me the credit I deserve. The Kains have also given out everything they had... though they had less than me... And it's easier to give out things when you're poor as a church mouse... "
508952, "I am grateful to you, boös Vlad. "
508953, "It's your duty. More than once have I heard you being called a ruler. The title implies certain obligations. "
508954, "...You've given everything you had? "
508955, "And it was still too little... We've estimated that help will arrive in five days. According to the last census, there are about ten thousand people in the town... All in all, they've got dribs and drabs... There is a strategic reserve, but if it takes five more days... no one would be able to help us then."
508956, "Forgive me, boös Vlad. I thought worse of you than you deserved. "
508957, "Who is in charge of the public trust? "
508958, "Katerina. The last Mistress. But my daughter-and young Maria, as far as I know-are looking after her. All the works are, of course, performed by our people. All she needs to do is calculate the resources we have left..."
508959, "What led you to this peculiar situation?"
508960, "I respect Georgiy and generally recognize the Saburovs' rights... But we don't trust each other. As for Katerina-she is still a Mistress. She answers to the earth and keeps the whole town together like a single thread. If only my wife was alive... or my daughter was older... "
508961, "I see. "
508962, "I hope she won't tolerate any abuse. "
508963, "Let's see if it helps at all first."
508964, "If you truly care for it at all, I'd be rather grateful if from now on my recommendations were carried out precisely and without superfluous wranglings. "
508965, "Oh my... Aren't you a... falcon..."
508966, "Please kindly spare me your comparisons, dear Vlad. "
508967, "Silence! You whelp! If only you had the slightest idea of what I had, what I've lost, and what I've given away to these people-the people whose interests you are so eagerly defending-you would cool your ardour! The Olgimskys-once the richest industrialists of the area-are ruined now! "
508968, "Listen...!"
508969, "Look at this, the lad is going to teach me! He's going to manage my property! Reproach me for giving less than I could-while I have nothing left!"
508970, "That's enough. If I have wronged you, I apologize. This nervous atmosphere has left me exhausted."
508971, "If I ever took it in my head to compare you to an animal, it wouldn't take me long to find an analogy, master Vlad. Let's maintain proper business conduct."
508972, "Actually, I was planning to be the first to have access to the confiscated drugs."
508973, "You were not there... And now I'm forced-by your hand, if I might add-to report to governor Saburov... I had no time to hesitate, Bachelor. I'm sorry. The drugs have been confiscated and sealed up. "
508974, "It's a result too. "
508975, "You're in charge of the hospital now, aren’t you?"
508976, "I need a detailed report on the amount of pharmaceutical drugs we have. "
508977, "I'd like to offer you a bargain. It has to do with your fugitives. "
508978, "Oh, come now... To my mind, there's nothing to discuss here... However, a good bargain always catches my attention. So?"
508979, "I want you to stop pursuing them. What do you want in return? "
508980, "Can you donate your runaways to me? I can guarantee that they'll die in the end."
508981, "Hmm... Aren't you a humanitarian, my dear doctor... The thing is, I don’t need them to die. I need them to return to the bosom of the Bull Project... Punished, but unscathed. "
508982, "Perfect. I'll do my best to return them safe then."
508983, "What's in it for you?"
508984, "I have my own job to do and I need these people. As for now, sadly, I cannot disclose to you as to why."
508985, "And what would you be willing... to offer?"
508986, "I'm ready to hear your offer. "
508987, "I need the right that this caste seems to possess. They will dissect bodies for me. "
508988, "I see... Yes, this is a respectable motivation. A single butcher will suffice for this."
508989, "No, he won't. It's a dangerous and complicated task that will require many hands."
508990, "Let me see... I know what I'm going to ask... as a payment for my butchers... It's the unique resource you own... the one I'll never get my hands on."
508991, "Oh, come now... Any cutthroat can help you then... Try to make a deal with Bad Grief's bandits... That's the loss no one is ever going to, hehe, grieve about... And they're definitely knife-happy. The rites of the Kin and our own traditions mean nothing for them... "
508992, "I have no desire to make deals with that type."
508993, "In that case, I think I know a person of dubious reputation who will help me. I mean the son of Burakh, who's managed to clear himself of one charge only to get accused again immediately."
508994, "Then there's nothing else I can help you with."
508995, "Do you have a counter-offer which would suit us both?"
508996, "Wait a minute! I think we can find a different agreement..."
508997, "I'm listening."
508998, "What is it?"
508999, "Your influence with the Kains. I'll cease to pursue the butchers if Georgiy ceases... to pursue young Burakh. He isn't guilty. He has an airtight alibi against all charges... which I am willing to confirm. Let them leave him alone. Agreed? "
509000, "If you're vouching for him, I'll inform the Kains as soon as I have a chance. "
509002, "Indeed... Indeed... And I'd rather you convinced Rubin that young Burakh has nothing to do with... Isidor's tragic death. The thick-headed Rubin is the last one who still needs convincing anyway. The boy might be labelled a patricide, as if he hasn't had enough... You do see Rubin from time to time, I know that... "
509003, "I'll pass your words to Rubin. "
509004, "And I'd rather you avoided telling around that I know where Rubin is. "
509011, "Why do you care for Isidor's son so much?"
509012, "We have... a common goal."
509013, "I see. So you're saying he's completely innocent, right?"
509023, ""
509024, "I will richly reward a friend that finds Simon's body for me, and I will squeeze the last drop of blood from the mongrel who stole it!"
509025, "Did you manage to discover any new information with regard to the missing body of my brother?"
509026, "No. I was busy doing something else."
509027, "Your eyes belie your words, esteemed Bachelor. However, I know that truth is the only idol you worship. I have no reason to mistrust you... or to doubt the decency of your intentions. "
509028, "Thank you, Judge. "
509029, "I am not a judge, my most honourable doctor. I am a lawmaker. And it sorrows me greatly to see the laws I have conceived overthrown and trampled underfoot. When you see Simon, take every care to deliver his body to me as soon as possible, and fully intact."
509031, "Everything I do, I do according to the command of my conscience, believe me. It is my harshest judge. "
509032, "Fair enough. You seem to be a person of keen judgement."
509033, "I'm sure that your brother's body will be found soon. Considering the townsfolk's pious respect for your brother, his body may have been stolen by fanatics. I doubt they would have nefarious intentions."
509034, "Your brother's body has been stolen by Stakh Rubin; under what circumstances, I don't know. He had examined the body here at The Crucible, hadn't he?"
509035, "... I cannot believe what I hear! Where is it now? "
509036, "I don't know."
509037, "I believe it's somewhere near Isidor's makeshift laboratory. Rubin never leaves it, claiming to continue his observations."
509038, "This information is invaluable, Bachelor, I am much obliged. I will allow Rubin a chance to explain himself before the day ends... perhaps there was nothing else he could do under the circumstances. Nevertheless, the reward I was going to pay for any information concerning Simon's whereabouts is rightfully yours to claim."
509039, "Thank you. "
509040, "I need nothing. "
509042, "I have a favour to ask of you, Judge."
509043, "My dear doctor! Misfortune is a regular guest in our family home. A new calamity has befallen us. "
509044, "What is it? "
509045, "The house in which Rubin lived and worked has been tainted by infectious mould and fallen prey to the looters! Our messengers searched every nook and cranny: neither Rubin nor Simon's body are in the house. Some of the people that helped to undertake the search are paying a terrible price; they've contracted the Sand Pest."
509046, "Let's hope that Rubin will get in touch soon."
509047, "Why do you altogether reject the idea that Rubin is hiding your brother's body for reasons of his own?"
509048, "What reasons could he have? It's simply impossible that he would do something like this. Stakh Rubin is a noble man. He would never stoop to such a heinous crime."
509049, "Well... I suppose you know him better than I do."
509053, "True, someone could have stolen the body to force our family into offering ransom for its return. In this case, Rubin's silence and absence might mean that he is in pursuit of the thieves."
509060, "Is there anything I can do for you?"
509061, "Please help us recover the body, doctor! We are already much indebted to you for having identified Simon's killer. It's not your fault that the truth has turned out to be so distressing to us all... I implore you to help Simon, and us, once more. Find my brother's body!"
509062, "All right. I'll help you."
509063, "The task is far from trivial. Where do I even start?"
509064, "I am indebted to you, dear doctor. Speak. I will be happy to grant any request that is within my power to fulfil."
509065, "It has to do with Isidor Burakh's son."
509066, "Yes, I know the man, if only by what the others have to say about him. Regrettably, I've yet to meet him personally. He was one of the main suspects in Simon's murder. He also hasn't cleared himself-not to my judgement, anyway-of the charge of murdering his own father. Now he is the main suspect in the theft of my brother's body. I hope you are not going to solicit forgiveness on his behalf?"
509067, "That is exactly what I'm going to do."
509068, "No, never. "
509069, "Ahem... This is one of the few requests that I am not prepared to meet. That is to say, I wouldn't be-if anyone other than you were asking. But I believe without a shadow of doubt that you are acting in good faith and with most noble intentions."
509070, "Vlad Olgimsky vouches for his honesty and is prepared to be a witness for him on all the charges you've brought against him."
509071, "So it was Olgimsky who asked you to intervene? Don't trust him, doctor! Don't trust him. Olgimsky has many qualities worthy of respect, but being honourable is not one of them. His honour ends where his avarice begins. If he is prepared to vouch for something, it is a clear indication that he is going to profit from it."
509072, "So what do you want to ask of me? "
509073, "Actually, it was Olgimsky who wanted to ask something of you."
509074, "Young Burakh deserves to have a break. That's what I need of him now anyway."
509075, "Very well, doctor. I will do what you ask of me. But having done that, I urge you to tell me who stole my brother's body as soon as you learn their identity. I promise I will not punish Burakh, only unless it turns out that he was the thief."
509076, "You have my word."
509077, "You have my word. And if I find out that Burakh was the culprit, you'll be the first to know."
509078, "So? What did you see there?"
509079, "Everything's dead. The dead tissue would not allow the microbial culture to survive. We might have tried to force the bacteria to reproduce... the problem is, there are no bacteria left. The culture has perished."
509080, "This is bad..."
509081, "Quite the opposite, colleague, this is outstanding! What we've just discovered allows us to suggest that Sand Pest does not linger in dead bodies. As soon as it kills an infected person, it leaves. It needs warm blood, rich in oxygen, to survive. "
509082, "What does this mean?"
509083, "Firstly, it suggests that something as simple as house walls might provide a certain level of protection. Secondly, that the killer's life cycle is very short. Therefore, there is a natural restriction on how fast the disease can spread. As soon as the infection kills whoever carries it, it dies."
509084, "This means the disease can be fought?"
509085, "Yes. There is hope. Although the enemy is invisible and ubiquitous, it is far from invulnerable. We have found at least one weakness."
509086, "Keep your voice down. And listen carefully. I've told these people you're not the person who ordered the butchers to cut corpses. "
509087, "Thank you. I appreciate that."
509088, "But... "
509089, "Silence! Don't 'but' me. We need you alive. Why are you taunting these people? Fear and hatred have already put a dent in their obedience."
509090, "What did you tell them? "
509091, "I had to concede that there's an unknown ripper on the loose. Twice a criminal. For daring to raise his knife against the inviolability of a body, and for defiling the sacred peace of the dead. I told them you weren't the real ripper... and we've started a manhunt for the real one."
509092, "No! Anything but this... How am I supposed to look in the eyes of those whom I promised non-interference?"
509093, "No names were named. I don't know who you're referring to-nor do I want to know! You hear me? I want nothing to do with cases about defiling the dead! My public line is, whoever is caught dissecting a body will be summarily executed and made an example of! Be more careful from now on."
509094, "What am I to do now? "
509095, "These patrolmen were keeping watch at the cemetery. Right now there is no one there. I will task them with blockading an infected district. And I will dispatch the next shift of guards to the cemetery ten minutes-do you hear?-ten minutes after you leave. You have a ten-minute headstart to do what you need to do."
509096, "Thank you, governor! I understand and appreciate what this act has cost you. "
509097, "These patrolmen will be sent to their deaths simply in order to provide cover for my actions? That must not happen."
509098, "As you wish. But remember: if you leave your work undone, someone else will have to do it and pay with their life for it. "
509099, "All right. I've changed my mind. Hold back the duty detail for as long as you can. "
509100, "So be it. "
509101, ""
509102, "Don't worry, sir, the evil-doers are dead."
509103, "Upon Olgimsky's orders?"
509104, "Who were they? "
509105, "For abominable sacrilege. "
509106, "Butchers. "
509107, "Why did you kill them? "
509108, "Aren't butchers allowed to dissect bodies? "
509109, "Bull carcasses, yes. That's kinda self-explanatory, no, good sir? Since when are they allowed to cut people's bodies for entertainment, though? Or do they know the lines? "
509110, "Armed resistance. They must have thought Fat Vlad had sent us. But there's something fishy about this 'ere business!"
509111, "Why? "
509112, "Whose entertainment? Their own?"
509113, "It gets worse. That beast carved 'im up and wrapped 'im up. Prepared 'im for something. Been waiting for the Ripper! He's still at large, is 'im that's killed old Burakh. Ain't gone nowhere; ain't fooling anyone! It was for 'im the butcher did it, no question about it..."
509114, "What in the world makes you think so?"
509115, "He was waiting for 'im, so he was... Anyway, it's all pointing towards it. Good thing we were there to dissuade 'im. But in a different neighbourhood, another butcher like that slipped away! I just got the report! How I'd love to give the beast a good thrashing! 'im and whoever's paying 'im! Shame I can't leave my post..."
509116, "Good fellows. Thank you for your service!"
509117, "I'd rather you not go to extremes like that next time. "
509118, "And what happened to the body?"
509119, "The body was given to the family. They'll bury it. "
509120, "Sounds like the right thing to do."
509121, ""
509122, "That villain, to chop up a lad like that... He must know his trade well, eh, dressing carcasses 'n the likes... Look, over there, they're carrying the body with all the cuttings. "
509123, "Where to? "
509124, "The cemetery, where else. To prepare for burial. Why d'ya ask, sir? "
509125, "It's you who have to report to me, volunteer, not the other way round! "
509126, "Professional curiosity... "
509127, "Why wasn't the body returned to the family?"
509128, "Ain't got no family. There's only Grace to give him solace now."
509129, "I see. "
509130, ""
509131, "Anything I can help you with, good sir?"
509132, "Was this body brought from an infected district? "
509133, "Yes. We're preparing it for the burial. What's in it for you?"
509134, "I need it for my work. "
509135, "No questions! Did governor Saburov forget to inform you of my mandate?"
509136, "Governor Saburov? Governor Saburov is not my commanding officer! I'm a volunteer-do you get that, doctor? Or do I need to spell it out for you?"
509137, "Perhaps we could strike a bargain?"
509138, "Silence! Know your place!"
509139, "Ain't that right... Well, doctor's work is vital work all right. It's not like you're body-snatching for fun, right? You're working in the interests of the public!"
509140, "Spot on."
509141, "Ten thousand money-and it's yours."
509142, "Are you out of your mind? "
509143, "I'm not gonna offer twice. "
509144, "Deal. "
509145, "All right. Here it is. "
509146, "You will give it to me since that is my order. By the name of governor Saburov!"
509170, "Greetings, friend. I heard news of your arrival. Everyone has. Are you here to examine the body as well?"
509171, "...My dear colleague, I do hope you haven't touched it yet."
509172, "I haven't. Is there a problem?"
509173, "Simon's body, wherever it is, poses a dire threat. I suspect he has died of a contagious disease."
509174, "There is the threat of an epidemic. The Crucible needs to be quarantined. Any access to the body should be forbidden."
509175, "No, the last thing I want to do in this life is to examine him without first taking preliminary measures."
509176, "What? It seems you know something I don't."
509177, "I have bad news for you. If we don't take measures soon we are in for a terrible ordeal. It seems like Simon died of a contagious disease."
509178, "I don't believe it... A second outbreak... Wait a second, I need to regain my senses... Are you sure about this? Do you mean what you say?"
509179, "I am, and I do."
509180, "If it's the Sand Plague... Master's death was so untimely! ...If it's the Sand Plague, we only have a few more days to live. You see, I have no idea how to stop it. No one does."
509181, "So you're already familiar with the disease?"
509182, "I'm only making assumptions. I don't want to believe this. I'd rather have any other plague than this!"
509183, "We have no time to waste. The body must be inspected. Isolated. Destroyed if necessary. We must take protective measures for that, of course."
509184, "Your mentor has encountered this before? What is the Sand Plague?"
509185, "Why are you so scared?"
509187, "I'd rather leave that to you. I bid you farewell."
509188, "Well... I will, of course, let you know the results."
509189, "No need for that. I'll be far away by then."
509190, "I know them already. They have proven to be quite unexpected."
509191, "Really? Would you share them with me?"
509192, "You will see it all soon enough. I wish you luck."
509193, "Dear colleague, Simon has died of a disease-contagious and most definitely lethal. Examining him without antiseptics is sentencing yourself to death."
509194, "So you're leaving the examination to me? You have a subtle sense of humour. Although I wouldn't let a genius like you do the dirty work... Thank you for letting me know."
509195, "What protection do you have? Antiseptics? Repellents? Vaccines?"
509196, "We need your diagnosis before we can provide reasonable protection. At the moment you can only buy yellow immunity boosters at the drug stores. They are no good... But I'll try to do something about this. We'll need to take some remedies from Master's old workplace. Did you know he was murdered by his son? An atrocity."
509197, "His son has nothing to do with this. I presume Isidor was infected by Simon and died of the same disease. Or vice versa... Let us not waste any more time."
509198, "You're right. Let's make haste. I'll get everything ready for the examination; meanwhile, let's arrange for the body to be isolated. Kain is keeping it in a cold place. I'll keep you informed."
509199, "If we act deliberately, and with calm mind, we can prevent this epidemic. Stay strong, I won't leave you on your own."
509200, "What kind of remedies do you speak of?"
509201, "That bastard! He deserves to be hanged by the neck until dead."
509202, "I couldn't have done otherwise. I apologize for an inappropriate prank; please don't be angry with me. Where shall we start?"
509203, "Our damn rulers will never come to an agreement! Just like the corners of a triangle will never come together. It seems that now is the moment to let go of any feuds. But their actions are understandable... It's hard to bow down to Katerina. She can neither dream nor soothsay!"
509204, "Why is it 'the moment'?"
509205, "We maintain balance on our own; nature has nothing to do with it. Our choices are what establishes the harmony that is essential for survival. Now is the time for them to realize it-now, when this balance has been disrupted by Simon's death. Katerina won't be able to rule like Nina or Victoria did. She has neither the power nor the talent."
509206, "I don't understand a thing of what you're saying."
509207, "As the Mistresses were dying, Katerina was throwing herself hither and thither, unable to choose a role; she tried to be Nina and she tried to be Victoria, but neither light nor darkness have worked out for her-she sucks at both. And you want us to listen to the Saburovs after that? Officially, they have the strongest claim to become the sole leaders. Katerina is the last Mistress after all. But her abilities are dubious. She told you you would die, didn't she? But, unfortunately, you're still alive. You can put two and two together on your own."
509208, "I don't like people who speak in riddles."
509209, "We'll come back to this conversation later."
509210, "But Saburov doesn't understand that and is trying to take advantage of the situation?"
509211, "It's nice to talk to a smart guy. No, I think you've scared Saburov. However stupid, he is also honest. He'll demand power not because he has a lust for it, but because he needs it to fight the epidemic-the one that, with all due respect, no one but him believes in... However, for both Kain and Olgimsky his actions are an excuse to snatch more power."
509212, "So the public doesn't believe in the threat of an epidemic either?"
509213, "The public believes there's an invisible maneater walking among them."
509214, "They will have to face the truth soon enough. Is there a way to make the rulers believe the only reasonable man around here? Do the Saburovs have any weight?"
509215, "Aren't the Saburovs legally supposed to rule over you now?"
509216, "Why bow to Katerina? I thought Alexander was the one in charge."
509217, "Alexander? Don't make me laugh. He borrows resolve from his spouse. Katerina can see the future-well, at least she is supposed to... It was Nina Kaina and Victoria Olgimskaya that ruled over us when they were alive. The rulers were nurturing the body of the town, while their wives were fostering its soul."
509218, "Were the Mistresses able to come to an agreement?"
509294, "The hunt for the Steppe maneater has turned into a funeral carnival. This is how the Kains are laying the keeper of our life to rest."
509295, "The Kains have the power, but it feels strange to see them use it like this."
509296, "The Kains are no less magnificent than their turbulent fantasizing would suggest... They hold the utmost sacral authority. One could even say, they are the architects of the law by which we are to live. Conceivably, they should do their utmost to define and implement the boundaries which we should never transcend-after all this is the core function of any lawmaking entity. But then, do you know what is especially fascinating about the Kains? The boundaries are nowhere to be seen."
509297, "Isn't an outlook like this supposed to hinder a ruler?"
509298, "Nina, may God have mercy on her soul, ruled over this place not quite unlike a vampire would govern her flock. Consequently, the people adore her even more now than when she was still alive. Whatever power Nina had to dominate the souls of her subjects, she hardly ever resorted to it. Not that she needed to: she was worshipped all the same and her most inhumane endeavours were eagerly forgiven. Just some food for thought, Bachelor."
509299, "Why did everyone put up with her then?"
509300, "The reason would be, perhaps, that whatever Nina did, she did to appease the people. However cruel, her every undertaking would illuminate the town with festivity and high spirits. There is hardly a thing that people crave more than they crave spectacle."
509301, "I see."
509302, "Wouldn't have worked on me."
509303, "Why would anyone love a person like that?"
509304, "They loved her for being a true queen. They love her for having died young."
509305, "And that's what people like?"
509306, "Or maybe they're trying to scare evil spirits away..."
509322, ""
509323, "Easing the pain of those who cannot be saved is also a worthy feat, isn't it? The military arithmetics are a double-edged knife. Is a doomed person already crossed out from the list of survivors? Even the dead deserve care."
509324, "What are you talking about?"
509325, "It's not a good idea to try to take away from the living for the sake of the dead-but perhaps you should share a part of yourself with them. It will pay back in spades. He who helps the dying pass on painlessly is sparing the world unnecessary suffering. We respect that here. Being considerate may even help you atone for murder."
509326, "So if you kill someone and then help several others pass on, the murder will be forgiven? I'll keep that in mind."
509327, "No one will suffer unnecessarily."
509328, "Military arithmetics is only a different way of caring for the living. You can't save everyone. It is smarter to make yourself busy with helping those who can still be saved..."
509329, "Sometimes they get way more care than the living."
509330, "So you have seen for yourself that people differ greatly. Sad, but true. Some of them shine like stars, others are nothing but steppe grass. There is only one thing that makes them different. Truly outstanding people care for others and are even prepared to give up their lives for their fellow men. People of the crowd only care about themselves."
509331, "Why are you telling me this?"
509332, "People will be willing to give up their lives for you, dear Bachelor, only to give you another chance to avert the forthcoming catastrophe. That is how you'll get to know them. Tell me, will you accept the sacrifices?"
509333, "No. I don't accept anyone's sacrifices. My job is to save human lives rather than waste them."
509334, "The life of a person can become the fee you'll have to pay to see the events move forward-unless you'd be willing to contribute to them, of course. Their motives will also differ, but their ability to give up their lives for a higher cause stays the same. Plague is the measure of humanity."
509335, "I only hope they wouldn't do it without my knowledge."
509336, "Let them risk their lives, it's every person's right. But I don't want anyone to do it in my name."
509337, "That's a strange way of compelling me to take action..."
509338, "I'll wait, see, and act appropriately."
509339, "Why would they do something like that?"
509340, "I have. Strange how the size of their hearts corresponds with the size of their mansions-if one were to believe you, of course."
509341, "Some people stand out while others don't. There's nothing more to it."
509377, "You were right. The bloodsuckers and maneaters had nothing to do with this. Neither did the werewolves. Or the Dogheads. Or the Soul-and-a-Halves."
509378, "Having an intelligent conversation with a reasonable person is a rare pleasure."
509379, "Also there are these writings on walls. The Soul-and-a-Halves thought at first that a monster was leaving them: either a night mara, known to have two knees on each leg, her second shin longer than the first-or a shabnak, whose abominable inhumanity was alone capable of inventing such signs..."
509380, "What were those writings?"
509381, "They really do point to the murder, doctor! Figuratively, I mean. Do you know what 'figuratively' means? It means not literally. It's the infected that write on the walls. If one had the bold mind of a poet, one could say the disease used the bodies of its victims to sully the walls with its signs!"
509382, "Well, Notkin, you're a poet indeed."
509383, "I can neither understand nor accept the irony in your voice. I'm offering you crucial intelligence, damn it, and you're making a wry face! If you want to find hotbeds-look for the thematic signs! They're painted by people who are so weakened they can't even moan anymore! These are cries for help! Cries of despair, if you like."
509384, "A fair reproach. I'll find these houses and find out what's going on inside them."
509385, "Thank you."
509386, "Yes, I know what “figuratively” means."
509387, "Are they really this horrible?"
509422, "Fat Vlad is nervous... The feathers on his snout can be seen from a verst away. Why is the Station so quiet? Why are the Warehouses silent and still? Why is there no Kin chorus or bulls bellowing at the slaughterhouse? Boös knows something, that's a no-brainer..."
509423, "Tell me about Olgimsky. Does it hurt if I push here?"
509424, "The Olgimskys have always been good housekeepers. That's in their blood. Big Vlad is in charge of the whole Bull Project-the Warehouses, the Works, the Station, the railroad, and even the Abattoir with the butchers. I can't for the life of me imagine how he handles it all, but they do respect him..."
509425, "So what's the deal with snouts and feathers then?"
509426, "This is very uncharacteristic of him. They say that the Kains are easy to anger, but it's nothing compared to Vlad's wrath. The Kains are people of aesthetics, they play angry; but Vlad sincerely loses temper over everything. He's either preparing a blow on the Kains or is trying to redirect attention away from his hulk."
509427, "I'll speak to him about this."
509428, "I don't understand how you people get along here. At all."
509429, "So he's the person that controls the Station, right?"
509430, "The railroad is the only cord that binds us to the big world. Freight trains travel along it. Now Kain has ordered to close the Station off to catch mara the killer. At other times this would be reason enough to go to war... but Vlad is surprisingly silent."
509431, "Why?"
509432, "The slaughterhouse... You mean that neolithic tumour on the outskirts of the town?"
509433, "You are the tumour! It is the womb, if you will, that gave birth to everything you see around. Vlad is lining his pockets quite successfully from it..."
509434, "How?"
509451, "The lust for profit and ambition have nothing to do with it. I think they're simply confused. The final balance point is destroyed, and our whole life is going down before our very eyes."
509452, "What's the point of an equilibrium system if a single man's death threatens your whole way of living?"
509453, "Here's how it used to be. Saburov was the official leader, but Katerina was the weakest Mistress. The brilliant prophet Nina was Victor's wife, and the youngest Kain held no real power. Vlad was the richest, but Victoria stopped him from abusing his resources."
509454, "What happened next?"
509455, "Nina died. The Kains would have lost the power over the soul of the town, but Simon seemed to have absorbed her spirit. Simon didn't rule; he was a creator. Katerina, who had been inclined towards Darkness before, became the Black Mistress..."
509456, "But she was held back by the White Mistress Victoria..."
509457, "The balance was restored. When Victoria died, Katerina rushed to take her place-she was quite afraid of playing games with Mother Darkness by then. The last of the Mistresses was struggling and throwing herself from one extreme to another. Her fiasco was made up for by Simon. He transferred all executive power over to Saburov, but brilliantly held the soul of the town in his grasp."
509458, "And now none of the rulers knows what his family is in charge of?"
509459, "More or less."
509460, "You have a curious idea of a government around here."
509461, "We'll return to this subject later."
509462, "So no one wants to bow his head to Katerina, who failed to become either a witch or an angel, right?"
509463, "That's pure stone age animism... Do you believe in reincarnation?"
509464, "I'm only trying to find the words that would be easy to understand. Don't you feel that this place is very different? Our town is a fragile ship that went out into the sea and got into a storm. Power balance is essential to our survival."
509465, "And Victoria was your guardian?"
509466, "Lara, that's enough. I'm a civilized person. Please spare me this gibberish in the future."
509467, "So the Mistresses' power complemented the power of the rulers to that extent? How could it be?"
509468, "First of all, they could see the future. Secondly, they breathed in unison with the earth, 'listening to the Steppe.' Finally... the aura of their spiritual force could be felt physically. The Mistresses maintained life in the town, changing its intensity; they were like energy clots."
509469, "And that is no longer so?"
509470, "This is awful... A feudal structure. It isn't even feudal, it's prehistoric. I don't understand how you managed to survive like this."
509471, "Why are they confused?"
509472, ""
509473, "Those whom you save will speak for you."
509474, "Speak for me? To whom?"
509475, "I don't know. The dead told me to remind you that you will be spoken for by those whom you save, that's all. Is it true that you're going to leave us soon?"
509476, "No, it's not."
509477, "That's great! This means I'll get a chance to play with you."
509478, "I don't have time for games."
509479, "I get shivers down my spine when I imagine the games you might like to play."
509480, "Of course."
509481, "Yes, I'm leaving on the next train."
509482, "There won't be a next train. There will only be the train that will unload boxes and take the meat; but they won't load the infected meat onto it."
509483, "Infected meat?"
509484, "Yes. The town is full of bad meat. The people will start stocking on food, because they expect war. The executors will give them the infected meat from the Warehouses."
509485, "Damn it..."
509486, "I'll deal with your Warehouses."
509487, "I don't even want to know where this came from..."
509488, ""
509489, "The three heads of the dragon are facing three different directions. Three powerful families, three clans are overturned by the wind. This wind got in through the breach torn by Simon's death. How will they cope? Will they be able to come to an agreement? The Masks do not know the answer to that question."
509490, "And who does?"
509491, "The Masks are two, but the families are three. I suspect the extra family is just that: an extra. It's superfluous. Someone will have to let go of their power-before their fellow men remember a different art of letting."
509492, "Letting it go to their head?"
509493, "Bloodletting. Fading into non-existence voluntarily is still better than perishing under the pressure put on you by implacable foes. Wouldn't you agree?"
509494, "I wouldn't. People are supposed to fight to the very end."
509495, "More or less..."
509496, "Which of the three?"
509497, "You don't need me to tell you that; the answer is yours. They're so different... Which one do you prefer? You came to this town-and now there's one more piece on the board. You are not a queen, of course, but a rook at least. It's up to you."
509498, "Thank you."
509499, "Neither do I."
509500, "I still don't understand how you came to the conclusion that the disease which killed Simon is contagious. Even if we assume that the rumours of a death carrier are nothing but rumours... which I doubt."
509501, "Call it intuition, if you will."
509502, "If you are right, Bachelor, and there really is going to be a Sand Plague epidemic in this town, there will be no stopping it. You don't need to waste your life, and you cannot help us in any way. Your only goal is to survive until the Station is reopened."
509503, "Peculiar fatalism. Are you saying that the services of an educated medic won't be of any help to you?"
509504, "Education is of no use here. Isidor may have had no medical education, but he managed to drive the demon back to hell. By the way, he mentioned that one can't beat the plague by traditional means."
509505, "What means can it be beaten with then?"
509506, "It cannot be beaten. Isidor was a wise man. He was born here and knew many things that no education can provide. Bachelor, your goal is to survive. Save your talent for the Capital. Leave this place. My father will be happy to assist you."
509507, "I'll speak to your father."
509508, "Thank you for the advice, but I will decide what to do with my talent on my own."
509509, "I will find my own way to stop the disease."
509510, "According to certain people, even that won't be an easy task."
509511, "When will the Station be reopened?"
509512, "It’s probably best to aim for the time after they've stopped hunting the maneater and before the town is quarantined... Speak with my father."
509513, "I will."
509514, "There has already been an outbreak of an unknown disease in your town. I used to occasionally communicate with Isidor Burakh, the man who put an end to it."
509515, "...But I'm sure Isidor never told you about this. The brief encounter with the Sand Plague put him in a state of primal terror. Did you know that? His opinion of his role in stopping the outbreak was not very high... and he ascribed that victory solely to circumstance."
509516, "It's strange he didn't suspect anything when examining Simon..."
509517, "Anyone who doesn't believe there's an outbreak is a perfect fool. We need to block off everything! Delay is tantamount to death. Right?"
509518, "Right, but how do you know all this?"
509519, "Look. When people thought a maneater was in the town, they locked their doors up. Only the brave ones didn't-and those who somehow knew that the rumours were all fibs. Got it?"
509520, "Not yet."
509521, "Whatever. Most folks just hid in their homes. Even those who joined the hunt locked the doors behind them, I checked that myself. Can't blame them-she managed to get into that Focus inside The Crucible after all..."
509522, "All right. So?"
509523, "And now some houses are standing ajar. They say there's moaning coming from inside. All in all, no one in their right mind would invite the disease to their home. I'd say that kind of welcome is a bad sign."
509524, "So you think I'm going to walk around pushing every door until one of them opens?"
509525, "What for? That's stupid. Even I wouldn't do that. There are other clues that set a dangerous place apart. Ask some guys around here. As for the girls, you can ask Grace and Capella. Not Murky though-her imagination is getting the better of her. She makes up a lot of weird stuff that gives me chills."
509526, "Thanks for your advice."
509527, "So the locals leave their doors open when there is no hope left... A nice custom. Quite useful."
509528, "A thought-provoking observation."
509529, "The capability of a mob to draw correct conclusions from incorrect premises would work as a great thesis subject... What are you hinting at?"
509530, "True, I've seen very few open doors so far. And?"
509531, "Yes... Georgiy is beside himself... However, I don't have the power to defy his orders. He is the eldest in the family. I'm doing everything I can to make him face the terrible truth. Simon wasn't immortal, but that neither entitles nor compels us to despair."
509532, "What can I do for you?"
509533, "Before you leave this place, please, save as many people as you can. I will reward you for every life you save. If only I could, I would get myself tools and medicine and walk around the town curing the infected."
509534, "I'll do everything I can. I've said this many times..."
509535, "All right. Anyway, how does one leave this place? I'm not talking about myself, just asking about the available means."
509536, "...Olgimsky owns the fleet of carriages and locomotives. Perhaps you'll be able to strike a deal with him. Moreover, a regular train with factory goods and provisions is due to arrive any day now. After unloading, it will head back immediately. Good luck."
509537, "I see."
509538, "This train must be allowed in, but cannot be allowed out. Don't worry, I won't leave your town until I make sure the disease has been contained."
509539, "I need to leave the town as soon as possible. Matters of great importance await me in the Capital. The people I'm responsible for there are in danger."
509540, ""
509567, "I'm sorry. How's it going, esteemed doctor?"
509568, "I'm not finished yet."
509569, "I've been informed today that you have received a direct order from your immediate supervisors. You are supposed to curb the epidemy at any cost and... as far as I understood, you are also our only protection from the heartless inquisitor sent here by the Powers That Be. Is that really so?"
509570, "Yes, it is."
509571, "Not quite."
509572, "Who told you that?"
509573, "Oh, I've got some metropolitan contacts... Come now. You are not the only outsider here."
509574, "What you're saying is there have been new people coming from the outer word recently, am I correct?"
509575, "Don’t look for plots and schemes where none exist, dear Bachelor. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. Do report to me as soon as you're finished."
509577, "I need your help, master Vlad. "
509578, "I'm listening."
509579, "I won't be able to finish the current task without a weapon."
509580, "Please do not overestimate my powers. My former possesions do not belong to me anymore. Since yesterday I'm nothing more than a manager serving the items required. I can only provide you with what I currently have."
509581, "Many thanks."
509582, "It's not enough. And so I'm once again on my own..."
509583, "I need antibiotics and antiseptic drugs. You're well aware that the stock has been plundered, but I've heard that you keep a strategic supply. "
509584, "I need a lot of money-at least according to my definition of 'a lot of'. The sum I require would be a tiny piece of nothing for an industrialist and a town-owner."
509585, "How do you get your mail, master Vlad?"
509586, "Just like you do."
509587, "And how do you send it? Do couriers leave the blocked town? Or do you send carrier pigeons to cover eight days' worth of travel?"
509588, "A witty answer. I couldn't have hoped for a better one."
509589, "The matter turned out to be more complicated than I predicted."
509590, "Find someone else to do the job, master Vlad."
509591, "I've heard that several noble people are endeavoring to snatch dangerous tasks from you. But their lives are a hundred times more at risk than yours... Still.. Pray forgive me... If you will be able to look their nearest and dearest in the eye afterwards... do as you please."
509592, "Don't worry, I'll deal with everything myself."
509593, "I just wanted to stress that I actually owe you nothing."
509594, "You've done my yesterday's work, haven't you, doctor?"
509595, "I've done what had to be done to thwart the danger."
509596, "I don't know if there is a point to it though... The absolute mortality rate is a generally recognized fact... Victor, dare I say, has even endeavored to prove it... Did you know?"
509597, "Yes. This is exactly what I've been working on."
509598, "Yes... There's no one to cure. The only thing we can do is trying to keep those who have dodged the Scythe safe. An isolation ward could have been useful, but... they say the Sand Dirt has rather unusual means of spreading... is it true that it bites at you as soon as you allow yourself to think about it?"
509599, "No. This is absolute rubbish."
509600, "Is that so... Anyway, dear Bachelor, I have a confession to make. You've given me enough hints to show that you already have a suspicion. It's hard, but I cannot allow myself to remain silent."
509601, "I'm listening."
509602, "The disease has infiltrated the Termitary. I'm still keeping it locked up. It used to be requisite to keep the disease out-and now I want it in, lest it spills into the streets. And I think you can fathom what that would entail..."
509603, "Just as I thought!"
509604, "Tomorrow we'll have a talk. I want to see it in person."
509605, "I'm a generally suspicious person, you know. Speak. Confession is good for the soul."
509606, "Indeed. Better me learning about it than an inquisitor. Their trials are swift, their executions-brutal."
509607, "Some conditions are more likely to emerge when the potential patient has a certain psychological predisposition towards them. Cancer, for example, is considered to be one of these."
509608, "No. Why would he do something like that?"
509609, "Talk to him, he'll explain his motives in detail."
509610, "I will."
509611, "So what?"
509612, "After a fashion."
509613, "I have obviously done the job no one else would."
509614, ""
509615, "So Doc, do yesterday's stiffs visit you in your sleep?"
509616, "I sleep like a log and never dream."
509617, "That's just how our bloody life goes, eh? You sin and you sin... You live quite a life teasing the devil, but when it comes to death? Won't scare it away with a knife, you won't. That's just how it goes, Doc."
509618, "Grief, I need a large warehouse. Like that one with the big half-round roof."
509619, "Why?"
509620, "State affairs, Grief."
509621, "Got you loud 'n clear, Doc. Your business is yours 'n mine's mine. Give me thirty grand, and the remote one is yours-lock, stock, and barrel."
509622, "It's a deal."
509623, "Thirty thousand? I don't have that much. Bite me! "
509624, "All right, twenty five then. Deal?"
509625, "Deal, you insufferable lowlife."
509626, "Make it twenty. "
509627, "No. It's either twenty five or get lost. Get back here when you've got the whole sum; otherwise, well... where nothin' is to be had the king must lose his right. I'm givin' the place to you at a loss, I am, out of sheer love for my dear Doc and respect for the art of medicine."
509628, "Fine. Let it be twenty five."
509629, "No. That's too much."
509630, "What's inside?"
509631, "It's anyone's guess, Doc! Think of it as a lottery. I can't recall what's in there myself, I swear it on my forefathers' bones. What if there's a weapon stash? Now that would be a steal!"
509632, "It's settled then. Twenty five it is."
509633, "Twenty. Whatever's inside, it's still a very hefty sum. You won't regret it, old fence."
509634, "Lock, stock, and barrel, you say? What's inside?"
509635, "I'm going to use it as a prosectorium. Newcomer surgeons are going to work there-and they shouldn't be interrupted by a single living soul."
509636, "Get your thugs back on the leash then. I bet if they hear this sermon of yours, the streets will get safer at once. Everyone has to die, can't argue with that."
509637, "You know what? You're right, Doc. You've got them smarts! I'll tell that to 'em, I will."
509638, "Atta good boy."

509650, "The theatre is closed by supreme command! The season's over. The troupe's disbanded. Follow the news on the poster columns."
509651, "Who ordered the Theatre closed?"
509652, "Vlad Olgimsky, better known as Vlad the Voluminous."
509653, "Olgimsky... I've actually come to relay his orders to you. From now on all you theatre folk are placed under my command. You will do whatever I tell you to."

509655, "Don't try your luck, beakhead."
509656, "Unfortunately, our most esteemed and graceful sir stage assistant has gone home with the keys. May it be known to you that he lives in the Chine district. As soon as it became known that a calamity is unfolding in the Chine, a tragedian went there, but we haven't heard from him since."
509657, "I'll find him."
509658, "If I find out you lied to me, I'll have you hanged."
509659, "Open the door."
509660, "Open the building. I intend to make some changes inside."
509661, "Why was it closed?"
509662, "It doesn't meet the health regulations. Yesterday some people tried to turn it into a conference chamber-use it to invite elected representatives from the common people to cooperate on the plague issue."
509663, "It's good that it was closed. Now open it up. I need to inspect the building and arrange to have it converted into a hospital."
509664, "The people demanded that? And were denied? By who?"
509665, "If you know what's good for you, you'll open it for me and smile in the process, too. A ruler's order."

509669, "Then please be so kind as to tell me what I can do for you."
509670, "I've been told that Immortell gave you the keys to the Theatre."
509671, "But he didn't order the Theatre closed! That came from above. They told us to keep people from gathering in one place by any means. Truth is, in times such as this, the theatre is the one place where people flock to in droves."
509672, "Stop trying to be smart. Give me the key."
509673, "Oh! You are our greatest, our most unwavering hope! Better it be you than a gallows-loving inquisitor!"
509674, "Follow me and stay in sight."

509679, "Quite."
509680, "I need your help."
509681, "I wish to thank you!"
509682, "What do you offer?"
509683, "The keys that I gave you, most excellent Bachelor, will become municipal property. They will be handed over to the person overseeing the hospital... or whatever facility you are going to turn our theatre into."
509684, "A hospital, yes."
509685, "You do have a sense of humour after all. Although the Theatre has always been a hospital in a way; we just used to mend souls rather than bodies there."
509686, "Then a hospital it will remain."
509687, "I'm listening, so keep talking. The keys will be handed over to the overseers-and?"
509688, "You'll be unable to visit the place at your own discretion. Somehow I feel it's going to become off-limits soon."
509689, "For everyone except myself."
509690, "Are you offering me key copies?"
509691, "So the legends of your mind-boggling prescience were true! Indeed. We actors do not wish to deprive ourselves of your company. We need an audience to stage our performances for; we need a volunteer to tell them their fate... But I was actually planning to offer you this bottle as a sign of our goodwill..."
509692, "Thank you, actor. I'll drink it to your health."
509693, "I do have the keys to those doors. I'll visit your rehearsals."

509702, "Forget it. Why were you looking for me?"
509703, "Oh, right. I have the keys to the Cathedral. Big Vlad told me you were going to turn it into a... ward?"
509704, "I am."
509705, "You know, our Cathedral... Oh, nevermind, I don't want to waste your time whining. What I wanted to say is this may be the only chance for it to fulfill its purpose. Perhaps it will finally host a miracle after all."
509706, "That's fine. Give me the keys."
509707, "Then I bid you farewell. It seems unlikely that I'll be able to get out of here at all; I have a bad feeling about it. But I wish you the best of luck!"

509713, "Money always works."
509714, "Can't say I'm a wealthy person. I'm almost broke, but I do have a small bottle of a certain precious beverage. Do you know what this is?"
509715, "Twyrine?"
509716, "The main issue with twyrine is its unpredictability. Drinking it suddenly boosts your immunity-and then after some time it's gone, similarly without warning... Sometimes there's no effect at all. But, well, it's not so well-loved for its effect; those helpful properties were only discovered after the plague broke out..."
509717, "Thank you."

509728, "Olgimsky's men locked it up. Lately, those armed servants of his have been acting like they own the place! He had ordered them to straight out kill anyone who tries to leave the Termitary-and, well, that order did nothing to improve their moral stance..."
509729, "Who has the keys to the Cathedral?"
509730, "My cousins have the keys. They both went to the Hindquarters on some business with Andrey Stamatin."
509731, "Very well. I'll find your cousins."
509732, "What business could they have with that thug?"
509733, "I don't know... They don't report to me. So how's it going? Have you figured out a cure already?"
509734, "No."
509735, "The sooner we are done with all this pointless scurrying, the sooner I will do just that. Do me a favour and mention that to anyone with any sort of authority whenever you get the chance."
509736, "Did he really give such an order?"
509737, "Yes. And they even executed-the order, I mean... oh... well. It happened more than once-I've heard there are thirteen people dead already. And you didn't hear it from me, but supposedly several runaways managed to escape and have gone into hiding. Olgimsky is offering a hefty two thousand for any information about each of them. "
509738, "Just information?"
509739, "Only if it proves to be true, of course. Some have already been caught."
509740, "How do I get inside the Cathedral?"
509741, "Fine. Who can open the Cathedral?"

509746, "A hole in any body is a very intimate thing. Even your natural orifices are better off closed or covered. Cover your mouth when you yawn, else the soul may fly out. Cower in the corner when you defecate. Cover youselves with sheets and darkness when you copulate. It's the orifices rather than people that make all those processes taboo."
509747, "Come on, this is drunken rhetoric... "
509748, "And the unnatural holes-don't even get me started! Who can tell if the body wants to be opened? How is it meant to be cut? A carcass only welcomes the touch of a master. The cut of a master follows the line that liberates the body from itself."
509749, "Haven't you ever... how did you put it? 'Created unnatural holes in bodies'? You seem to have mastered the art of knifing."

509759, "Pardon me? Since the head standing before me is celebrated for its inability to utter commonplace truisms, I can only assume that the wisest of bachelors is laughing at me. Or do they explain any taboo with this drivel in the Capital these days?"
509760, "Perhaps there might be some sense to what you're saying."
509761, "There's a beast sleeping in any of us-I'm not denying that. A beast startled by any orifice or hole."
509762, "Hats off to the fine guest. Do get intoxicated with us, you prisoner of science!"
509763, "Listen, why does any attempt to examine a dead body lead to so many complications around here?"
509764, "The bastards deserve to be exterminated. No one will punish you for killing a criminal. An official decree was just announced by Saburov's men."
509765, "So what, are you planning to get your hands dirty too?"
509766, "And why not? Muggers and killers hold nothing sacred-so they are exempt from sacred laws and traditions. They pulled their knives first. You're free to disembowel them, tear their arms off, and perforate them to your heart's content."
509767, "Glad to hear that."
509768, "There's no need to perforate anyone, be they innocent or guilty."
509769, "That makes my job easier."
509770, "If you care for your bodies so much, how come there are so many murderers roaming the streets? Am I not supposed to hurt them too?"
509805, "I don't see any reason to continue. The microbe does not live in a non-organic environment. It's a curious phenomenon... but it leaves us without a leg to stand on."
509806, "Really? Why?"
509807, "Because the quantity of the vaccine I can produce with what I am able to recover from my source is preposterously small. I will compound the solution, though. Truth be told, I've started the process already."
509808, "So you've managed to procure the living microbial culture? But how?"
509809, "Not really... Whatever weak specimens I've gathered from... the source I've mentioned... the culture is almost dead, even though I try my best to sustain it. The first samples of the medicine will be ready by tomorrow morning. It won't qualify as a vaccine... but it will offer some kind of protection."
509810, "This is most certainly better than nothing. Anything else I could help you with?"
509811, "You look like you could use some sleep, Bachelor. As for me, I am dog-tired, which is made worse by the twyrine fumes making any kind of mental focus impossible. Tomorrow I will try to find young Burakh myself. I also might be able to sneak into the Termitary to speak with the Kin."
509812, "Very well. I'll see you tomorrow. "
509813, "I hope the first batch of the vaccine will be ready tomorrow."
509814, "Do tell me more. What did you use on it?"
509815, "I've made something of the kind already. It's untested though... I'll try to find a volunteer tonight. I wouldn't hesitate to try it myself, but taking personal risks is hardly viable, what with the lack of medics or physicians in the town. If I die you will be the last."
509816, "Give the sample to me. I will have the vaccine tested."
509817, "This is not a vaccine, doctor. From your perspective it's more like some useless swill, of a kind a child would make. I wouldn't go about testing it if I were you. But, if you are convinced that you can afford the risk-take the sample. Do let me know if there are any meaningful results."
509818, "I am quite convinced, yes, and I will make sure to inform you."
509819, "I'm not sure I want the risk... Let us find a volunteer first. Then we'll see where it takes us."

509851, "Touch ahead if you find any, doc! Touchin' feels nice. Although I prefer the livin'... Why?"
509852, "I need the body of a sand plague victim to extract an infection sample."
509853, "Ah, you mean you wanna cut? No cuttin', doc, no way! Nope. Not allowed. I'm tellin' you as the materialst that I am, either them zealots'll tear your arms away from them sockets, or some ugly seethin' pest'll crawl outta Steppe. I'm sayin' that from experience, I am. My lot, they prefer stranglin' with a cord."
509854, "That's utterly barbaric."
509855, "Fine. Seems like it was a bad idea to begin with..."
509856, "Hear this-and the question is purely theoretical: who among your thieves knows how to cut a man dead? "
509881, ""
509882, "Executing the orders of our new governor. What a disgrace! Using your name as an excuse, Saburov has ordered my father to organize an isolation ward, a hospital, and something else at his own expense... I hope my father treats you well?"
509883, "Was that a joke?"
509884, "If anything goes wrong, do tell me. My father is truly a miserable man. Can you imagine how heavy the burden of his responsibility is? He is in charge of the lives of several thousands of people!"
509885, "My imagination is betraying me with this one, sorry."
509886, "I'm also responsible for the lives of several thousands of people now. Let us hope that your father will support me out of mutual respect, if nothing else."
509887, "Of course he will. You must know already that our family used to be very rich. I happened to find out that almost all of our resources went to the Capital-to bribe the officials and obtain drugs. Do not be too harsh on him."
509888, "And how in the world did he manage to transfer the money to the Capital? "
509889, "I cannot possibly guess."
509890, "Curious."
509891, "But I can. He did it beforehand."
509892, "Quite the contrary! I respect his actions and his choices-and I appreciate it that you love your father so much."
509893, "I'm afraid it might be I who mistreats him."
509894, "Tell me, when is your father planning to unlock the Termitary? "
509895, "Not until the specialized medicine arrives. Several thousands of people live there. They cannot be allowed to get infected."
509896, "Is it known for a fact that there are no sick people inside?"
509897, "It is known for a fact that no one gets sick in the Polyhedron. Not a single person has left it since the very beginning of the epidemic, and now the children are notifying their parents that they are all in good health. The parents themselves are begging the children to stay inside."
509898, "Can you honestly swear to me that it's the same with the Termitary?"
509899, "Mmm... I really hope so. Father knows what he's doing. "
509900, "All right."
509901, "Do your visions confirm it? "
509902, "It is naïve to assume that visions allow me to see through walls. It's not an eye-lens! A vision is like a ball of various temperatures. Information crawls inside you through your spinal cord, it's not even articulated."
509903, "So everyone in the Termitary is fine?"
509904, "Are you going to work with the dead yourself? Are you serious? Or am I mistaken?"
509905, "I don't really have a choice."
509906, "There are some butchers on the loose. It was not so long ago that I could have commanded them in my father's name, and they would have brought you anything. They have the power and the right to break the udurgh's bonds. But now, after the riot, our name doesn't really carry the same punch."
509907, "I've no right to disclose the place publically. I'd rather do everything myself. Like in the good old university times!"
509908, "The butchers are not known for their long tongues."

509918, "Don't, Lara. Save it for a rainy day. "
509919, "The train must arrive soon. I wonder why it's late. Sometimes I fear the delay may have something to do with the quarantine... I so hope it had departed before the quarantine was announced."
509920, "Let us all hope. "
509921, "Take care of yourself, Lara. "
509922, "Thank you, but you don't have to offer me anything. We're not man and wife."

There are but a few people in the Kin who can dissect a man: the Wardens, whose families have been keeping this right for many generations. Isidor Burakh was one of them. His knife's pierced many a body-and always with great success."
509929, "I don't need an autopsy. I only need to extract a blood sample. "
509930, "Still, dissecting the dead is taboo... it's not a rule, but rather a custom with its meaning long forgotten... Some people in Earth still preserve the memory of the terrible nature of this knowledge... Unluckily for you, the majority of the patrolguard volunteers are Steppe people..."
509931, "So I can give it a try, right?"
509932, "The few people whose fates are now bound to yours... will always be there to help you... Your fame is getting greater and greater by the day... They'll be eager to give you anything you might need... And offer their advice..."

Although I'm in no position to give such advice... I haven't been outside for a long time... I'm all about what's inside..."

509936, "Thank you."
509937, "I don't need advice. I need order in the town and a shred of common sense. "
509938, "You mean the patrol wouldn't just be passive, but would rather actively try to murder me for doing our common job? In that case, how are they helpful at all? Who can I rely on?"
509939, "That means I'll have to act at my own risk."

509942, "I do. What did you see? "
509943, "There is one more outsider competing with you. Like you, he's trying to wriggle his way inside the dead... He will be interfered with and most likely killed... He'd do better than you, but I doubt that would bring us relief... He may very well destroy your purpose, the sole thing you were born for..."
509944, "Who is this person? "
509945, "Young Burakh... Isidor's son is now looking for an answer to his father's riddle... Searching inside the dead is a viable attempt... But the path he's taken is perilous. He will inevitably make a mistake... Both Mistresses would have concurred."
509946, "Why does he look for it inside the dead? "
509947, "Why is this path perilous? "

509958, "I was helping my father. He was burying those who had died from the disease and I was sprinkling the graves with twyrine. I got sick. A girl named Murky brought me three powders. I ate one and got better. I gave another to my father and he survived too. And I still have the third one."

I've called my lads and we volunteered him a nice healthy thrashing. The bastard was lucky to get away alive! 'I'm a butcher,' he said, 'I'd never cut badly.' Yeah sure! A butcher! Just wait a sec, mate, let me kindly lay all my fucking guts open for you!"
509981, "Why did he say he was a butcher? "
509982, "Well, that's not actually what he said... He said 'menkhu', it's a Steppe word. These people aren't just butchers, they're kind of jacks-of-all-trades. General-practice rippers."

509984, "Tell me about this custom. "
509985, "I'm not an expert... it's the epitome of complicated. There's this local tale about an ayga girl and her beasts cooking gruel. They made gruel out of the girl in the end for not knowing how to cut a croup. So be cautious, surgeon. This tale is very popular here. As is gruel."

Rats are entangling her in a web of rat lies-and it is us who get the short end of the stick."

In days of yore women used to couple with bulls to extort mysteries of the future from them. But humankind is growing smaller and pettier... it's all surrogate."

510087, "Our small town has neither an isolation ward, nor a morgue, nor a clinic. You know that. The task was extremely complicated. Were we suppoed to look for an abandoned house? To evict someone to clear up the space? Fine, we went this far-but by the evening it turned out they had no water."
510088, "No water in an inhabited house? How is that possible? "

510092, "What are they afraid of?"
510093, "They are unsure as to whether these buildings will do... The sanitary conditions there are non-existent, and it's unclear how to prepare them. Doctor, they need your instructions. Just in case, I've ordered these places to be off limits for the general public and sent inspectors in. But I suspect they'll be rather... useless. Do help them, doctor."

510106, "What measures were taken yesterday?"
510107, "It all reeks of sabotage. "
510108, "These scurvy words would cost a life to anyone but you, esteemeed doctor. My people and even my family members went around the whole town, falling down from exhaustion. Some of them got sick and are now dying."
510109, "I apologize for having lost my temper."
510110, "You should have started with the public places! Who in the world thinks a residential building is a suitable place for an isolation ward? A hospital? A morgue?!"
510111, "We did well-though it was a challenging task. The so-called Wastehouse has proved to be an ideal location, so we've cleared it up to refashion it into a morgue. As for the isolation ward, it will be founded at the Ravels'."
510112, "How so?"
510115, "The residential property has no water access. You'll have to redirect your attention towards public buildings. "

510138, "What about the hospital?"
510139, "The hospital is almost ready to be opened. I'm not sure there's much sense to it though... unlike the morgue. Everyone has already admitted the disease to be... hmm... the Sand Pest. We've chosen one of the standard houses. You'll like it."
510140, "What? As far as I know, Lara Ravel was planning to turn her house into a small shelter for a few dozen people tops-and nothing more!"
510141, "She agreed to undertake urgent steps. You know how fast the disease spreads better than anyone. Too many people are striving for a safe haven."
510142, "Was it her own decision?"
510143, "An isolation ward is not a shelter. It's a sludge tank for the people hailing from extremely unsafe places-which under the circumstances basically means everyone who's been outdoors."
510144, "We've managed to find an understanding. Every person has their own sore spot. When you make an effort to nudge that spot a bit, well... they immediately become... compliant."
510145, "Hopefully no one was deprived of a roof over their heads, were they?"
510146, "Of course not. We wouldn't be so harsh as to drive people out of their homes-even in case of an emergency. Don't worry, doctor. There isn't a single soul living in that house."
510147, "Obviously it's not one of the houses that were infected yesterday, is it?"
510148, "Well... Actually, it is. Nevertheless, we've made a most peculiar observation: there isn't a single trace of infection in these houses today. We've learnt it by chance... thanks to marauders. They stalk these places with no antibiotics whatsoever. Victor Kain would like to discuss this matter with you."

510155, "I had to do it to protect the... privacy of certain information. The good name of a certain person... and most likely the life of another one depend on it. Surely that's reason enough? Forgive me, it's uncomfortable for me to talk about it."
510159, "Wait. You have no water? How is that possible?"
510178, "Three ends, actually... It can end in three different ways. The town has been teetering on the verge for far too long... Balancing on the edge... like a ball trying to choose one of the three pockets. If it doesn't fall into one of them soon, the edge will rip it apart... The body will rot with bloody mould, and plague will devour this land..."
510179, "Er... What? "
510180, "Simon has built a puzzle... Everybody he Bound were generally Utopians or Termites... But I insist that he's built the town as a triangle... and so I declare loyalty to the third idea-the faith of Humility! I am their Mistress. There's neither heat nor cold anymore; there is only Earth..."
510181, "What is to be, will be."
510182, "Please be so kind as to notice... there stands a girl. Her name is Clara, and it's within her hands to tie or untie our fate... It's fine if you don't want to help... She will make sure that the new balance that arises... is proper..."
510183, "How?"
510184, "This blessed girl has the power to decide... who lives and who dies. She has the right... My spouse and I trust her. She is the emissary of fate, a guardian angel... Not a harbinger, like I used to think... but rather a miracle maker... "
510185, "Wait a minute. So what am I supposed to do?"
510186, "What do you mean?"
510187, "Simon's woven equal shares of love and hate into this town... His genius kept the feelings of those who adhered to the three different principles in check... he knew how to derive benefit from their contrariety... Now discord has become meaningless. Like the town itself, the three-pointed taglur is frozen in a deadly stalemate... The town's fall is inevitable."
510188, "Keep in mind the three outcomes, please. The town is overburdened... it's filled with too many unnecessary things... So reconfigure the fates. Our future path will be decided by the new list of the Bound... as shall the future outlook of our miserable little world... Speak to the dazzling Maria about this, if you will..."
510189, "I will. You're scaring me."
510194, "So that's how it is. Clearly, Simon has not reached the end of his earthly path yet... "
510195, "Are you aware of Katerina's recent claims?"
510196, "No. What, did she decide to make herself heard again?"
510197, "Yes. She's made a prophecy-that I won't take seriously, of course. But you might find it interesting."
510198, "What was it? About the doomed ones? Probably so, since she must be seeing more or less the same things that I see, though from an entirely different angle. Katerina is older than me, but her visions are distorted by a prophet known as Morphine. Too much noise."
510199, "She spoke about a taglur that is smothering itself, and therefore requires a corrective intervention-involving blood."
510200, "Oh, my goodness... Clara will confound our plans. She is a formidable opponent. She will cause a public commotion; she will make people die. She'll be unstoppable. The important thing is to try to ensure the survival of those who have put their trust in you."
510201, ""
510202, "I shall see to it that the people of Gobo's Taglur, who will of necessity have to surrender their lives to me, will not have given them in vain. The new generation will not include mortal enemies. The new world will be built on universal love and concord."
510203, "Damn... So that's how you talk now. Doesn't sound like your own words, though."
510204, "Yes. We'll exterminate all those who try to play the antagonism of Day and Night, or of Reason and the Earth, to their own advantage. We'll exterminate those who've made the Olgimsky and Kain clans the banners of this war. We'll exterminate those who've used the powers of the Dream Mistresses and the will of the heads of houses to fan the flames of this meaningless strife."
510205, "So how are you going to... cleanse away the filth?"
510206, "They'll exterminate themselves. Everyone is at risk now, and death will more than once raise its scythe over many, and these days death is bound to raise its scythe above every link of the taglur. But since we foresee these moments, we'll mercifully save many from this terrible reaping."
510207, "...With your permission, I'll now leave. "
510208, "Someone may have seen something... I believe you've made some useful acquaintances in the town's slums. Not to mention we have all manner of lowlife here; could they know something? Speak to my brother Victor. He is much better than me where the practical side of things is concerned."
510209, "I'll let you know what I find."
510212, "How can I help you? "
510213, "Rubin's disappeared. His home has been infected and looted. Neither his body nor Simon's was there. Where could he have gone?"
510214, "I don't know. I haven't seen him. Do you suspect that Rubin is dead?"
510222, "How would you explain the absence of the body? "
510223, "It appears that once the infection began to spread across the house, master Rubin decided to remove the body. He must have taken it to some hidden location that he considered safe. However, since we still haven't heard from him, we can only infer that Rubin is dead."
510224, "The body was stolen, perhaps? "
510225, "I know for a fact that Rubin is alive and has the body."
510226, "What do you mean by that? "
510227, "He works in one of the abandoned Warehouses, but he hasn't finished examining the body yet."
510228, "I'm sure he'll let you know of his whereabouts any moment now, and you'll take your brother's body to the Cathedral with due honours. "
510231, "I don't have time for this now."
510232, "Something tells me that isn't going to happen."
510233, "Were you going to ask me for help? "
510234, "I don't know anything about that, I'm afraid."
510235, "Every hour brings us more trouble... "
510236, "I'm looking for your brother's body, Victor. Do you have any ideas on the subject?"
510237, "Do you know anything regarding Rubin's whereabouts? "
510238, "I do. If I were you, Olgimsky's son would be the first person I'd turn to. Young Vlad, nicknamed Charon. Rubin and he have had some business together. He knows places where Rubin may have taken the body."
510239, "Why? "
510240, "He is suspected of murdering his own father. Accounts of the bloody events of two days ago include a man whose description he matches. And I wouldn't rule out his involvement in what happened at Rubin's house."
510242, "Her-and no one else? "
510243, "There's also Burakh, hiding somewhere in the town. The younger one, of course."
510244, "That savage... "
510245, "Is he hiding? "
510246, "Have you already asked him? "
510247, "I've tried. But we are in a difficult position now. On the one hand, we are putting pressure on his father; on the other, we're asking him for a favour... "
510248, "Putting pressure? I was under the impression yesterday that we had managed to put an end to all disputes between the ruling families."
510249, "There can never be an end to disputes between our families; it's as impossible as reuniting day with night. But now I feel that Big Vlad's actions have a bearing on the root of all our troubles. I don't like this silence from the Termitary! Could it be there that the infamous murderer is hiding?"
510250, "Your brother succumbed to the disease. I thought we'd already come to terms with that."
510251, "A stranger has made their way into the town. Human or shabnak, it doesn't matter. We can't establish whether their involvement in Simon's death was direct or indirect, but the involvement is clearly there."
510252, "All right. I'll try to ask Vlad the Younger."
510253, "I'll talk to him. "
510256, "The thought has crossed my mind too. The Termitary riot coincided suspiciously with Isidor's return from the Steppe and the outbreak of the epidemic."
510257, "Vlad the Younger is a loyal son. He may be cynical, but deep inside he believes in the precepts of vassal ethics. He has no reason to conceal a crime-but he'd never help us knowing that we're acting against his father's best interests. Notwithstanding our respect for each other."
510258, "Why did he deny you help?"
510259, "Why?"
510260, "It has been revealed to Maria in a dream that the cause of Simon's death is hiding at the Termitary. I intend to find out why Big Vlad refuses so adamantly to open it. And you should ask Vlad the Younger if you get the chance!"
510261, "Perhaps I won't even need to."
510262, "I respect such adherence to principles too. "
510263, "Tell everyone in your household to remain indoors. If anyone had to be sent outside, don't let them back in."
510264, "What, abandoning them in the middle of the perilous night? "
510265, "No. Such people will have to go to the isolation ward first. Saburov promised me that the ward will be set up soon. "
510266, "I come bearing news from the Olgimskys. It has to do with the Termitary. "
510267, "Ingenious. Damn it! All right... So be it. If that's how he's spinning it, then I'm forced to leave him alone. For now! You can tell him that. It will only last until we find proof that not everything is in order inside the Termitary!"
510268, "I hope there's no doubt in your mind that I am obviously only doing all this to get the Olgimskys to reveal the location of Simon's body to me."
510269, "I haven't been wasting my time either in the meantime. The information my couriers have brought back is terrible: there's a ripper in the town. Fragments of human bodies have been found. It's either a stranger who doesn't observe our traditions, or... it really is someone or something sent by the Steppe."
510270, "Perhaps you might order your son to open the Polyhedron so that Olgimsky's agents could inspect it? That will give us the right to inspect the Termitary."
510271, "My son has long ceased obeying me. He regards me as an enemy. Only Nina had an influence on him. His beloved sister was someone he might have trusted, but now even Maria can't make him open the Polyhedron. And I wouldn't take the risk either. Let the children remain fortified."
510272, "I'd like to make sure that your confidence is not groundless."
510273, "I don't believe in Steppe monsters. Who could need dead bodies? "
510274, "Since the dawn of time, the beliefs of the peoples of the Steppe have forbidden them to dissect their dead. They who penetrate the mysteries of anatomy, penetrate the mysteries of creation. That is taboo. In these troubled times, a demon has come who broke it. The destruction of a body will put the Earth in pain."
510275, "Who is this stranger? "
510276, "Earlier, I feared that Big Vlad was sheltering him at the Termitary. It's clear now that that isn't the case. He is on the loose. I think he is the thief. Also I believe that he's the very man who's been accused of patricide. The cursed, wayward son of Isidor Burakh! "
510277, "What makes you think it's him?"
510278, "I haven't made up my mind yet. I just have my suspicions. The end times are upon us if sons have ceased to honour their fathers. They are turning the earth towards the void. Toppling what their parents built is what these wayward children are best at-but they never create anything in its place!"
510279, "I feel you're talking about your own son... "
510280, "You are entitled to your opinion."
510281, "How do we find this person? "
510302, "There are some very peculiar attitudes about the dead in your town..."
510303, "Yes. They are derived from pagan superstition. The body is considered to be the sum of all truths; the ligaments keeping it whole-to be the ligaments of the universe. It must not be taken apart without the knowledge of how those dissection cuts will reverberate in the makeup of the universe."
510304, "And you share in that superstition?"
510305, "I do."
510306, "Why should I suspect that?"
510307, "If Rubin were alive, he would undoubtedly make his whereabouts known. And he certainly wouldn't keep quiet about the pest getting inside the town. He's one of the few who have an actual understanding of what that entails."
510308, "Well, if neither Rubin nor Simon were in the dead house, that means Rubin has at least attempted to move the Keeper's body to another place. Otherwise we would have to surmise that someone has stolen two infected bodies with peculiarly obscure purposes. Wouldn't you agree?"
510309, "You're reading my mind."
510310, "There are several locations where Rubin could have taken the corpse. But I have no plans to reveal them to you until you do our family a favour in return."
510311, "So, what is that other place? "
510312, "Gladly-unless it takes up too much of my time."
510313, "I find it hard to believe that the body's been stolen. No madman could ransom it to the Kains and get away alive, and you could never find the kind of blasphemer who would defile it out of sheer malice. Rubin will make himself known soon, you'll see."
510314, "Look... Rubin's dealings with our family are... our family's business. We value his trust. I don't feel that disclosing the details to you would be the right thing to do-not unless I see that... hmmm... the family would benefit more than it would suffer from that exchange. Do you understand?"
510315, "And still I beg for your assistance. There is no doubt in my mind that you have a theory of your own."
510317, "In all honesty, I don't."
510323, "I do."
510334, "I managed to settle the matter. Victor will no longer insist on inspecting the Termitary."
510335, "I'll keep my word-honouring the venerable Simon's remains is our mutual goal. We are bound by the same grief. There's a ripper-perhaps even more than one-on the loose in the Knots. I think they're runaway butchers."
510336, "Runaway butchers? "
510337, "Why would they dissect bodies?"
510338, "Well, let's just say they use the innards for fortune-telling. The times are difficult; I think their desire to tell what fortunes the future may have in store for them is perfectly understandable."
510339, "...Or those few who were unlucky enough to find themselves outside when the Termitary was blocked off. Now they're hiding in the town. I believe they're stealing the dead to use their bodies for divination. They have their own future-telling techniques."
510340, "Where could they be hiding?"
510341, "Where can I find them?"
510342, "To be honest, I'm not sure myself... One curious young man managed to trace their path. It seems they have been carrying the dead to the Spleen district. I'll mark the house on your map."
510343, "Thank you."
510344, "If they resist, am I allowed to kill them? "
510345, "Not only kill, but take whatever possessions of theirs you may find in that house. Body snatchers are no longer protected by law, even if they happen to be butchers."
510346, "Very well."
510375, "Have you heard anything about the ripper? "
510377, "Yes... I've heard the rumours. Several bodies missing from the cemetery... Nevertheless, you must realize a single person couldn't have done it. There must be several people. One man just couldn't appear in several places at once over such a short night... but you'll have a chance to see that for yourself soon."
510378, "Could it have been young Burakh? "
510379, "Whom do you suspect then? "
510380, "The butchers, of course... It's a no-brainer. Even the sickest bastard wouldn't commit... a blasphemy like this. Some people are shameless enough to use a knife... But no one, except for butchers, would steal bodies... It's dangerous and pointless to boot."
510381, "Pray forgive me... No, it couldn't have been him. All this time young Burakh's mind was busy with one thing only... Isidor's death and his inheritance. He had no time for corpses, believe me... Besides, Burakh is a Steppe person, even though he was brought up elsewhere... He honours the rite. "
510382, "Fine. I believe you. "
510383, "Fine. I believe you. "
510400, "And what do you see? "
510401, "Maria! I need to get into the Polyhedron. "
510402, "You cannot. It is off limits. Especially to you, since you tend to plunge into the thick of the battle. Who knows what you might bring back on your coat... Yes, en-Daniil! I admire your courage. If the impression you've made on me is not fallacious, then you belong to the kind of people that the world is running out of."
510403, "Tell me, what's inside it?"
510404, "Children playing, Bachelor Dankovsky. Fifteen hundred children. It is their princedom, and my little brother Kaspar, styled Khan, is their uncrowned prince. That place is clean. No evil can enter those walls; it would bounce off them like sunrays... I can see it."
510405, "Aren't you afraid that the infection may have found its way inside?"
510406, "Never! Upon my word of honour, rest assured that no evil can ever make its way in there."
510407, "How can you be so sure? "
510408, "Not an hour goes by without me shuddering at the thought of that omnipresent evil creeping into the specular fortress of the Polyhedron. But I am watching the situation there closely. Trusting neither my gift nor my intuition, I get hourly updates from Khan."
510409, "Simon's Focus also appeared to be impregnable to any visitors. That didn't save him though."
510410, "Simon was killed by Isidor. I realize that with great clarity now. Simon himself had brought his murderer along into Focus."
510411, "I'd like to talk to your brother."
510412, "And yet?"
510413, "All right. Climb the Tower. Khan will confirm that I am right. "
510414, "And your father-is he also completely positive there's not a single sick person inside the Polyhedron?"
510415, "Yes. Any one of us-my father, my uncle, or my brother-would swear to you upon their honour and their earthly purpose."
510416, "I appreciate your trust. I won't let you down."
510417, "All right, I believe you. And so from today on, I will vouch for the truthfulness of your words on my own honour."
510418, "My feats are much humbler than they may appear. Tell me, is it possible that the infection has already struck at those who are hiding in the tower across the river?"
510419, ""
510420, "You wanted to speak to me. I'm listening."
510421, "I need to examine this structure. "
510422, "No, guest. That is impossible. We don't trust grown-ups. We can't allow the corruption to get inside. That's why we risk our lives guarding this place. Perhaps the pains we're taking will be convincing enough proof for you."
510423, "Who are you guarding your tower from? "
510424, "You. Your doppelgangers. Everyone who comes from across the river. "
510425, "I don't have any doppelgangers."
510426, "You do. Two of them. Also endeavouring to save humanity. At least that's what they say; every word they utter mirrors yours. And so far, they've caused nothing but harm."
510427, "What kind of harm? "
510428, "Our salvation lies in repose and silence. Our town must stay still now. Freeze, like someone who's stirred up a nest of venomous snakes. Then the disease will abate and burn up in its own flames. I was told these were your words. Were they? "
510429, "Close enough. But what do my, ahem, 'doppelgangers' have to do with anything?"
510430, "More like my thoughts, really."
510431, "They make people uneasy. It's because of them that no one stays put. Disturbed by the Haruspex's actions and the Changeling's barmy preaching, people start fussing and end up laying their lives upon the altar of the common good. We children will not listen to you."
510432, "Not a good idea."
510433, "Why? What did I do to lose the trust of children?"
510434, "I'm protecting our world. We were doing just fine without you. We can handle this plague even if it spells the end of the world. Did you want to check that this place is clean? Have a look around. It is clean. I promise you. But I won't let you in, wise Bachelor. No offence."
510435, "Are you sure? "
510436, "You may mean well, but you bring evil and destruction all the same. This town is too fragile for your thudding steps. Your heavy hand will crush us all-even if you were only grabbing us in order to pull us out of the abyss. Go in peace. Everything's all right here."
510437, "More allegories... Looks like it runs in the family."
510438, "Will you promise to let me know if anybody becomes sick? "
510439, "I promise. I'll be happy to talk to you anytime here at the Agate Pit. And if something terrible happens inside, I'll be the first to shout for your help."
510440, "That's reassuring."
510441, "I'll mention what you said to Victor next time I talk to him."
510442, "I've found the body snatchers. They were runaway butchers. "
510443, "Did you find the body? "
510444, "A body-dissected and disfigured. However, I find it hard to believe that it once belonged to your brother. I'll show you the building where I found it. "
510445, "I will send my people there at once! You have my gratitude."
510446, "Be cautious. "
510447, "Georgiy is infuriated. Why didn't you inform him of where you took the body?"
510448, "If this is the case, consider me swayed to your side already. No matter what anyone may say."
510449, "What about you? Do you possess this kind of privilege?"
510450, "Hard to say... my Master was planning to 'bind me with the blood of his kin'. In other words, I was to become his foster son. He never got to complete the procedure. As a result, I am formally allowed to perform dissections-but few people know about it. Most of them still see me as a soldier, rather than a butcher."
510451, "So you did military service?"
510452, "Not for long. I served in General Shoin's army until I was injured in the head by the Skerries. I was released soon thereafter."
510453, "I hear you... But from what I can see, not everyone in the town belongs to the indigenous population?"
510454, "What are the menkhu?"
510455, "Translated loosely as 'men who set apart the parts of a whole', the menkhu are the adepts of the Kin. Butchers, surgeons, prophets-any occupation that has to do with knowing the separate parts that comprise a whole..."
510456, "Fine, but I am definitely not a menkhu. So what am I supposed to do?"
510457, "How do you think the bacterium kills, Bachelor?"
510458, "It causes a massive contamination of the blood. In so doing it overloads the cardiac muscle. In all likelihood, the infected suffer a stroke. That is something we didn't know before! "
510459, "So, in order to acquire the potent, living microbial culture, we will have to get our hands on a still beating heart? This is borderline absurd. "
510460, "We can start to research your vaccine though. Don't you have that... unique source of yours?"
510461, "I do."
510462, "In any case, our work must no longer be delayed. Not after the new hope today has brought."
510463, "Could you please explain what exactly you are trying to say?"
510464, "Are you perhaps unwell? Your pupils are dilated..."
510465, "Why the big words? Or have I accidentally just overheard something not intended for my ears at all?"
510466, "I suggest you make up your mind... Simon's death untied the connections; people got loose like the stitches of a poorly-knitted sweater. You know of the three wills and the three ideas they adhere to... Someone will have to die, while another will live. Or will it be others? I suspect you will have a say in the matter... Bachelor Dankovsky."
510467, "I refuse to become anyone's death. "
510468, "I don't believe your nonsense!"
510469, "She will hardly have the time to do much evil. "
510470, "I don't want to play these games, Katerina. I am a scientist and an emissary of the Powers That Be. Spare me your leapfrog."
510471, "What I've just heard is enough for me. "
510472, "You need to have some sleep, Katerina. You have a fever. "
510473, ""
510476, "As you undoubtedly remember, our first attempt at making a vaccine involved a microbe that was already dead. To this, the organism produced almost no immune reaction. In our second attempt we had a... weakened microbe to experiment with. Weakened by... well, you know how. The third vaccine, then, should be made on the basis of a living specimen!"
510477, "The bacterium dies when extracted from a life-sustaining environment. Do we need to collect a portion of infected blood from someone who is still alive?"
510478, "Something along those lines... Brace yourself, Bachelor. We need a human heart. A heart that is still alive and beating! This is the meat that will make our curative broth."
510479, "Do you suggest we bring someone here to slaughter them where they stand?"
510480, "That won't do... The infection must have progressed to an irreversibly critical state. Whoever carries it would be in agony by the time. We don't have to cut the patient up right here, though. I believe we have about thirty minutes to bring the heart here from wherever it is obtained."
510481, "Burakh was going to dissect the people while they're still alive?"
510482, "I'd like you to know that he is set to achieve a rather noble feat. He wants to duplicate his father's success. While we are busy trying to protect the healthy, he wants to make a concoction that will enable him to cure the sick. He calls it a 'panacea'. Reportedly, he's made quite a bit of progress on it."
510483, "I'll try to find Burakh."
510484, "Please do! This is by far the best bet. I guess the Olgimskys would know where their protégé may be found. But, if you're unable to get ahold of him soon enough..."
510485, "Very well, you can count on me. However effective the vaccine proves to be, we have to try."
510486, "Blood again... I'm so sick of all this blood. The very earth here is seeping with it... for all the good it does."
510487, "If it doesn't, then we will do good, colleague! The vaccine is almost complete! You seem to underestimate our achievements; I'm actually a bit hurt. Forget about blood, focus on what lives within its cells. A Sand Pest microbe-that is our ultimate goal!"
510488, "You're right. Wait here for me."
510489, "What am I supposed to do if Burakh refuses to help?"
510490, "You'll have to keep an eye on him then. If he's discovered, he will have to run for his life-serving as an effective decoy. No one will concern themselves with what remains of his... seance. Sneak up on a corpse he cut, grab the heart and bring it to me as soon as possible. The blood has to be warm."
510491, "Well, what can I say... It does seem to be a unique opportunity."
510492, "Still, this is... heinous. Keep in mind, I will not be cutting anyone myself. So let us hope I find Burakh soon."
510494, "So he will have no reservations about cutting the heart out of a living person?!"
510500, "You are the only person I can count on."
510501, "I must say, I'd be of more use to you here. You're making me do an errand boy's job."
510502, "Who else can I turn to? As luck would have it, all my assistants are either dead or... not my assistants anymore. I was offered some help, I grant you, but it's clear that if I accepted, my self-proclaimed aids would have ended up dead. You know some of them, actually..."
510504, "You don’t say! I'd be damned if I allowed any of them to die in my place."
510505, "These are hard times. We can't afford to refuse anyone's help."
510506, "I'd make an exception for some of them, but that's just my personal opinion. But you, Bachelor! Are you not a professional?"
510507, "That I definitely am."
510508, "Our opinions clearly differ. Don't worry though, no one will have to risk their life."
510509, "I'm doing everything I can."
510510, "This is it, doctor. It seems we have exactly what we need! We have brought the bacteria into the light; this writhing horned abomination... We can look at it now, and maybe even give it a name? You won't have to go to the Inquisitor empty-handed."
510511, "So the last iteration was different from the previous ones?"
510512, "The vaccine will be ready by tomorrow morning. Where did you get the specimen?"
510513, "Burakh gave it to me."
510514, "That blood is unusual. Did you ask him how he came across it?"
510515, "I didn't have a chance to."
510516, "Oh! You know, Bachelor, it's strange... I think I've learned to tell the character of a person by their blood specimen. Here's the blood of an egotist; this one belonged to a poet... The owner of this blood was exhausted, and whoever gave that specimen was destined to become a great person... Well. This blood is extraordinary."
510517, "It's better than nothing."
510518, "I'll pick up the samples tomorrow and test them personally."
510519, "What matters is that you make the vaccine. I'll be back tomorrow morning."
510520, "Eh... The heart belonged to a young dancer; possibly a prostitute."
510521, "Let us name it after the Inquisitor himself. I cannot escape the feeling he will be a bigger problem than the disease."
510542, ""
510543, "And so we finally meet, oynon. Just a pair of pawns on this dreadful chessboard where each square is blacker than black itself. Are we friends or are we foes? Will one consume the other-or will we part, each striving for his own victory?"
510544, "How can we be foes if we're fighting a common enemy?"
510545, "I'm glad to hear you say that, oynon. It's a shame we aren't standing together. I lack your knowledge. I'm blindfolded and can only follow my heart and my intuition. Here's a piece of advice for you: don't trust those who volunteer to be your guides on the path to victory. But the real battle is still ahead of us both."
510546, "You mean the battle against the pest?"
510547, "I mean the battle against you. We may not be foes, but I have a strong feeling that we will end up opposing each other. Each of us will try to tilt the balance to his own advantage. "
510548, "It's too early to tell."
510549, "I don't know what you're talking about... although I can probably guess. Whatever the outcome, I will remain true to my conscience."
510550, "If you're allowed to. My freedom has already been taken away from me. Do learn from my mistakes."
510551, "I will."
510552, "And how in the world did that happen?"
510553, "We'll be parting as friends. Hopefully we'll meet as friends next time too."
510554, "That will depend on which side you choose when the time comes to decide who lives and who dies."
510555, "We'll see about that."
510556, "Goodbye, Artemy Burakh."
510557, "I know. I have my own issues with the Powers That Be."
510558, "I hope you aren't going to sacrifice our town to settle your issues."
510559, "I will do what I must."
510560, "I'm really not in the habit of rejecting an extended hand. But why do I constantly hear that you're getting in my way, jeopardizing the people I am trying to save?"
510561, "That is true, I will drown it in blood. It's been foretold. You know that I come from a Steppe kin. We value the words that tell the future of a Warden. Some people I kill-in order to save others. That is all I can say in my defence."
510562, "I have nothing but respect for you, but we're unlikely to get along. In you, I see myself. I see the hands of your fate hold you by the shoulder. You are a pawn; I am a player."
510563, "We'll see which of us is a pawn in the end. You can't just call yourself a player; you have to deserve this right. Farewell, Bachelor."
510564, "Wait a minute. I need your help."
510565, "We'll meet again."
510566, "I don't know about you, Burakh, but I'm not a pawn."
510567, ""
510591, "Bless your wits and wisdom, doctor Dankovsky! "
510592, "What's the happy occasion?"
510593, "You've provided people with a shelter. Everyone's gathering at the Cathedral... it's a Cathed-real Cathed-rally. Three hundred and fifty people have already agreed to come over from infected districts."
510594, "Oh really?"
510595, "Bachelor, the credit for all the lives saved today is yours. You've made a very wise choice."
510596, "My choices are always wise, young man."
510597, "Come now... No need to blow it out of proportion."
510598, "I hope they see for themselves how rational the solution is."
510599, "Please spare me your flattery. It doesn't sit well with me."
510600, "Get stuffed!"
510633, "Yes. "
510634, "So what course of action do you intend to take?"
510635, "I have considerations of my own. "
510636, "And the thing is, Katerina sensed her inhumanity! But still we approached her as if we knew nothing of her secret. I trusted Clara. She seemed to me an emissary of some benevolent power, sent to assist us in disposing of this atrocious plague."
510637, "And now you don't trust her?"
510638, "Supernatural powers do not distinguish between black and white. They do not share human views on good and evil. To the human eye, the border that separates earthly evil from earthly good is thin, thin and broken! That ancient logic is beyond our understanding."
510639, "If Clara is guilty, you are the most guilty of them all. Your spouse is quite skilled in seeing what's hidden. If you knew her from the start to be a messenger of the Steppe... "
510640, "I personally entrusted this girl with checking the suspicious. One thing I know firmly-she is absolutely assured that she is doing good. She only tried sincerely. I do not know what creature hides beneath her skin and what it brings into the world... But Clara knows even less. She thinks herself a saviour."
510641, "The Inquisitor will listen to these arguments, but will not consider them when he sends you to the gallows. If you knew that the cause of our misfortune may be hiding inside Clara, you'll have to bear responsibility."
510642, "This again, the reasoning of prehistoric hunters... Fine, have it your way. I 'll study her blood. Where does one find her these days?"
510643, "Where it is most dangerous now... Whoever she is, she still believes that she is here on a holy quest to improve the order of things and help the doomed. Of that there is no doubt."
510644, "It very well may be so."
510645, "I'll talk about this with Katerina."
510646, "The search for the carrier never stopped since day one. All suspects were cleared by you. How do you explain this?"
510647, "You are remarkably quick to demote your adopted daughter from angel to demon."
510648, "There are no angels and no demons in the Steppe, Bachelor. Only spawns of the Earth-that-Bears and the Earth-that-Consumes. These entities have a different nature. We call them spirits-but they are merely animated meat. They try to imitate humans, which only makes their forms even more gruesome."
510649, "So you assume Clara to be a malevolent spirit posing as a kind one to mislead you?"
510650, "You gave her tasks. Don't try to deny it-I know. And now you think a Sand Plague carrier has been running your errands. I reckon this is a fact worthy of Inquisitor Orff's attention.    "
510651, "Hermann Orff was dispatched here? That is dreadful... How do you know? "
510652, "Orff, Mann, or Karminsky. Each has drills for eyes, razors for hands, and a mechanical numerator for a heart."
510653, "I do not fear the Inquisitor, Bachelor. I am well accustomed to answering for my actions. I am treating Clara with proper awe. Unlike you, I am counting on the veracity of the local tradition. It is my duty to burn the source of the plague, even if it turns out to be Clara. If you won't help me to determine the carrier precisely, I'll have to burn all the suspects.   "
510654, "Don't worry. I will study their blood. "
510655, "Why burn? Isolate. Come to think of it, most townsfolk of note are already under lock and key credit to my efforts."
510656, "Last night showed that isolation solves nothing. "
510657, "More lunacy..."
510658, "Last night once again showed the authorities to be impotent. "
510659, "No matter. Consider this, Saburov-the noose around your neck is tightening. The only question that remains is who will knock the stool from under you."
510660, "I heard she treats Katerina and you almost like parents. Is that true? "
510661, "You are responsible for what she has been doing. Hence I'd like to hear your recommendation. What am I to do with your protégé? "
510662, "Katerina and I made it clear we deem her a gift from above. Katerina was even ready to adopt her. There was something that confused us, however..."
510663, "What?"
510664, "Her strange disappearances and the odd consequences of her actions, I presume?"
510665, "No. "
510666, "Yesterday some unknown creature entered the locked Cathedral where several hundred healthy people found shelter from the epidemy. Witnesses say she walked among the sleeping and spread some sort of liquid upon their lips. Then she ran out through the gates. /n"
510668, "Any suspects? "
510669, "There was a panic inside. The doors, however, were guarded just as you ordered. Feeling trouble, the guards locked the gates until hospital attendants arrived. When the gates was opened, few of this enormous crowd still could as much as move their tongue. Those we managed to question identified the carrier."
510670, "I was told they identified a young lady, one well-known here. One of those especially beloved by the townsfolk. So no one said her name.  "
510676, "So, Bachelor, I have some news for you: the bad and... well, you know. All news is bad these days."
510678, "The Inquisitor whom the Powers That Be have sent to resolve our... erm... supposedly hopeless situation is Karminskiy the hanging judge. The man whose lips and nails are always wet with blood. You know him better than I do though. "
510679, "What is the good news then? Or was that it?"
510680, "That was the bad one. Here's the good news: he is willing to respect your decision. Find the carrier for him, and Karminskiy will declare you the person who has done his job."
510681, "Sounds tempting... "
510682, "Well... As of now, he's in good graces of the Powers That Be, so he can afford to do that. And besides, as you are probably well aware, the inquisitors have a very strict internal code of honour. They'd never conceal the truth; that would equal death to them."
510683, "I know that."
510684, "Thanks for the news. "
510685, "Oh, really? As far as I know, an inquisitor would never pass an opportunity to put another victory on their record. Сompetition..."
510686, "I'm not even going to bother asking how you came to know this..."
510687, "I don't know him, and I don't ever want to. I'll have you know I've never drunk brotherhood with him."
510688, "I'm listening."
510689, "Does he now? So these are the consequences of yesterday's conversation. A domino effect, no less. To what do I owe the pleasure of your company then? Did you come to see me as a friend? Or in your, shall we say, official capacity?"
510690, "Do you know what happened in the Cathedral? "
510691, "Of course. A terrifying tragedy, but also a mere nuisance compared to the overall drama."
510692, "Be honest with me: were you there? "
510693, "I know they have found something that belongs to me in the Cathedral. Let us see: a white scarf made of silk, a set of silver earrings with tiny emeralds in them, a gold ring made in the shape of a squirrel biting its tail, a pair of suede mittens, and a twyrine flask adorned with a crude engraving of me. Is this all?"
510694, "They say that whoever it was in the Cathedral was offering people infected jewellery. Which they accepted, hoping to exchange it for food."
510695, "They do say that, don't they. Though, I feel more amused by something else. The rumours of a semi-transparent witch are obvious nonsense. But then, how did it get into the Cathedral? You have inspected everything inside, did you not? The building was hardly prone to an intrusion like this. Not a single person died there in two days."
510696, "Yes. The building was almost watertight."
510697, "This Cathedral is damned, Daniil. Your project required a miracle to bear fruit, yet no miracle would ever happen within this empty shell of a temple. Everything that has transpired was to be expected. The Cathedral was breached because there was no possibility it wouldn't happen. These circumstances were ushered in by causes of a higher order."
510698, "You might be right. I'm beginning to get used to your logic of concordance."
510699, "Still, do show me your hand, please."
510700, "I didn't examine it personally, but judging by the observations of those who did... "
510701, "They say that in their death throes, people were tearing the jewellery from the... the lady guest... while she was covering them in her deadly kisses."
510702, "How did your belongings find their way into the Cathedral, Yulia?"
510703, "I gave these trinkets to... someone whom I believe to be innocent. At least, this is what my calculations suggest. However, you have mentioned Saburov? This does not quite gel... Could it be a case of split personality?"
510704, "What are you talking about? Are you talking to yourself? This is a textbook symptom of mental disorder, you know... "
510705, "I'd like you to promise me that the person in question will not suffer your anger. Instinctive anger, inconsiderate fury... these are no good advisors on the matter. This is a very complicated case, you see, no matter how tempting the most obvious conclusions may be..."
510706, "Yes. I give you my word of honour. "
510707, "Her name is Clara. She is a little girl with quite a few peculiar thoughts to play with..."
510708, "Oh? A curious definition... I assume you know her well, and have had time to grow fond of her? They say she's a gifted hypnotist... "
510709, "No. They say it was either you or Lara. "
510710, "Tell me the name. At least I'll be able to ask this person a few questions. "
510711, "If you repeat these words to the Inquisitor, it would hardly gain you his favour."
510712, "Inquisitors are, first and foremost, intellectuals. Just like you or me, they crave to uncover the truth and reject personal symapathies and beliefs in favour of more feasible methods of investigation. Speaking of which, I'd rather not have anything in common with vultures like Orff or Karminsky."
510713, "Let's hope it happens to be somebody else..."
510714, "Yes. Any of them would kill and torture people in numbers no less devastating than the Sand Plague itself."
510715, "I've always been your friend, Yulia. What makes you ask something like this?"
510716, "I am on duty. I need to examine a sample of your blood. "
510717, "Examine it all you like. I have nothing to be afraid of."
510718, "Stretch out your hand, if you will..."
510719, "Something has just crossed my mind... I'd share it with you, if you think you will be able to keep your calm. After all, we're both reasonable people."
510720, "I don't like where this is going."
510721, "Does the Inquisitor need a scapegoat to appease him? Let him have it then! You must give me up to the Inquisitor, Daniil. This will not mean you have betrayed me insofar as I am asking it for myself."
510722, "That's out of the question. "
510723, "Don't be obtuse, Dankovsky; not when the victory is this close! Go back to the Capital. You have to finish what you have started. You must challenge death, even if you will have to fight it on a different field. You must avenge us! I know it is all over for us here, one way or another. Let the dead bury their dead."
510724, "Do you think I'd just give up? That I would be tempted by the opportunity of an easy victory? In this case, you don't know me very well!"
510725, "Not really... Truth be told, I knew in advance what your answer would be. Still, it seemed worthwhile to try. Forgive my regrettable lack of tact."
510726, "Come now. You're intoxicated by this wretched herb... Go sleep it off, Yulia. "
510727, "Apology not accepted. I've changed my mind. I will report you to the Inquisitor. "
510728, "In other words, instead of fighting to reveal the truth, you are suggesting that I flee with a bunch of useful lies... Yulia, I didn't even think you would offend me so greatly! "
510729, "... Fine. I'll do it then. I hope that you will share with the Inquisitor the specific circumstances that you've refused to tell me about."
510730, "You made the right choice, Bachelor Dankovsky. Don't thank me-I have my own reasons to believe that this is the most reliable way to uncover what is hidden. The Inquisitor and I have a lot to discuss with each other."
510731, "Your decision will not be forgotten."
510732, "I will also attend the interrogation. "
510733, "How could you think that I would do something so low?"
510734, "But why? "
510735, "Where do I start... Suffice it to say I am more guilty than you may suspect. Don't ask me to elaborate. Let the Inquisitor question me and I will explain the situation in great detail. I don't think I will be able to explain as much to you... "
510736, "Go to bed, Yulia. I will pretend this conversation never happened. "
510737, "What are you talking about? "
510739, "I've mulled it over-and here's what I think. Hand me over to the Inquisitor. I'll have to talk to him anyway. You have every right to do that, don't you? And most importantly, you won't be making a mistake."
510740, "Why? "
510741, "I've mulled it over-and, well... people must be right. The key to this mystery, the mystery of the disease, must have something to do with me. Even if I'm not the cause, I'll help the Inquisitor get to the bottom of all this. He'll find a way to extract the truth from me."
510742, "On a rack... No. Not going to happen."
510743, "Well, I never... Are inquisitors allowed to torture people?"
510744, "You didn't know that? You must have been born yesterday after all. "
510745, "Whatever I do, I can't avoid meeting him. So why don't we just fix it so that it will be you turning me in? That'd be a great victory for you! Wouldn't it? Why are you frowning?"
510746, "I do not accept victories as gifts. You are free to go to the Inquisitor if you so desire, but only after I tell him of your innocence."
510747, "And what would be the value of such victory? The real foe has not been identified yet. Or do you expect me to behave like they do? To engage in wishful thinking? Lie to everyone and to myself? Like those who are in charge of our fate and who I despise so much...? No. I refuse."
510748, "No, I'm not frowning. I'm glad you've made the decision yourself, Clara. Perhaps you truly are a saint, like they say... You will go to the Inquisitor with me. Dixi. "
510749, "You're a suspicious creature, Clara. Perhaps you're right, it would make sense for you to have a chat with the Inquisitor. But I won't be turning you in to him as culprit."
510750, "Do as you see fit."
510751, "Aren't you afraid? "
510752, "I've already told you, you are not the witch. Is my word not good enough for you?"
510753, "Good day, Daniil. I'm not offended at all, you don't have to say anything! Do you need my hand? My arm?"
510754, "I wanted to talk to you first. Where were you last night? "
510755, "I stayed in, just like you advised everyone to. I've found out about the Cathedral situation in my usual way, by listening to the shouting in the streets. And then my former milklady-she's still alive, can you imagine that?-knocked on my window and told me about my necklace..."
510756, "What necklace? "
510757, "I had antique jewellery-it was very dear to me. And not just me: Stamatin offered me ten thousand for it-a fortune back then! Especially for an ordinary kamain-tree necklace with dark metal lacework... I don't really think it was worth that much, although the carving was magical."
510758, "The beads from this necklace were found at the Cathedral... are you crying?"
510759, "The beads were in their mouths. These poor unfortunates were muttering that mara sprayed her tears over them; others said she kissed them; the rest claimed that she offered them water... People called these beads 'Lara Ravel's tears'. And now everyone will think it was my doing!"
510760, "l'll dissuade them."
510761, "Check my blood first. It's only fair. At least you won't have any doubts that you're telling the truth then."
510762, "Thank you, Lara."
510763, "Just don't let it get to you, okay?"
510764, "They won't. Thinking is no longer a commodity everyone can afford, and the streets are full of crawling beasts."
510765, "It's a pity it's gone."
510766, "You're above suspicion, Lara. Don't you worry about a thing. "
510773, "So there is no carrier? Then I must have been right... No one is to blame."
510774, "I think I've made a mistake. I just don’t know where."
510775, "I, on the other hand, think you've already won. You've done everything humanly possible. You will return to the Capital victorious."
510776, "No way. Neither the Powers That Be nor their envoys recognize partial solutions."
510777, "I made up my mind, Daniil. As soon as the Inquisitor arrives, I'll come before him and confess I was the carrier. He will believe me, since my words will be supported by Big Vlad... and the chorus of people who were prying my beads from the lips of the dead. Then I'll have to remain consistent, and that's all."
510778, "What have I done to cause you so much grievance that you're suggesting this vility to me?"
510779, "But I really am a carrier, Bachelor. That'll become the truth. There's something you don't know. Don't try to dissuade me. You've designed the plan that would become everyone's salvation, but it's missing the cornerstone-the carrier's head. Am I right?"
510780, "The real carrier's head!"
510781, "You don't see the things for what they really are. Everything has a hidden meaning, a double agenda. You've solved the problem correctly... almost. But you're missing the main point, you've failed to match the two pictures together-the second picture painting me as the culprit. Just take it easy."
510782, "No. You will not go to the Inquisitor. I forbid it!"
510784, "Well, Lara... The choice was yours. Make you confession tomorrow-and remember that you have my eternal gratitude. "
510785, "The theory that the source equals the carrier has not been proven yet... It's merely a theory. An obvious one, but a theory still."
510786, "...Why do you insist on being guilty?"
510787, "But why?"
510788, "Look out of the window. Does it look like a victory?"
510789, "This cannot be. "
510790, "Seems like it... I was so close, yet I took a wrong turn somewhere."
510791, "Who cares for my heart? No one can hear it beat under these rags... Even the children avoid me. They call me The Nail, get scared, and don't let me play with them. That's the right thing to do, of course... Children are smart, their guts never fail them."
510792, "Wait, are you crying? "
510793, "Stop mocking me, will you? Didn't you realize that it was me all along?"
510794, "...You were... what?"
510795, "Why the funny look? Me, it was me. The Sand Plague, the spirit of the Steppe. What, would you like me to bow? Kiss you on the forehead? That's enough... it's all fun and games-until... I'm tired, and I'm bored. Today I've finally sated my hunger... for the first time in forever."
510796, "Wait... I don' believe you. "
510797, "Oh, just don't pretend to have been clueless, okay? You knew all along-from the very beginning. I never even made an effort to hide anything from you... Well, even if you were really so gullible, the Inquisitor will be on to me in the blink of an eye. That's not the person to have dust thrown into their eyes... So that's enough. It's time to confess. "
510798, "Stop it! Were you truly 'a thing of the Steppe', you couldn't speak about Inquisitors so confidently. You're lying! Why?!"
510799, "Well... People say things... I only repeat what I've heard... Eh... So, was my confusion believable?"
510800, "You liar! And your manner of speech? The word choices? If not for these clothes, I would've assumed you were a girl from the Capital. What do you want?"
510801, "Hand me over to the Inquisitor, Dankovsky. It doesn't matter which of you two catches me, you or he. I'd rather it was you. You'll return to your home city triumphant, you'll win your laboratory back! Find yourself a place where people would truly appreciate the fruits of your victory-and live there! As for me, I don't want to live any longer anyway. I'm too tired..."
510803, "You're right. I don't know who you really are, but the Inquisitor will sort it out. Perhaps you are indeed the carrier."
510804, "No. Won't happen. I got you-you want to cover for the real carrier... and that means you know who it is. That's all right, I'll pry the testimony from you... later."
510805, "So you're the carrier? The maneater? The rag-wearing midget, the shabnak with nails under her skin? What else... the mara? The turnskin?"
510806, "And what do you suggest? "
510807, "So the disease is you?"
510808, "Are you saying what I think you're saying?"
510810, "That's all right. Sooner or later you will find a man that will listen to your heart."
510811, "Greetings, honourable doctor! Our job is almost done. Are you satisfied?"
510812, "It depends on how well you've done it."
510813, ""
510814, "A rough crowd... demands rough measures. I sincerely hope you wouldn't get it into your head that I'm enjoying this."
510815, "How come there's no water in the town?"
510816, "The town's water supply's been sabotaged and ruined! To be more precise, we've lost the purifying system on the water intake that supplies water from the Gorkhon to people's homes."
510817, "How did that happen?"
510818, "The local blockheads, egged on by some overly active taskmaster, destroyed the water supply to prevent infected water from getting into the town. Can you see it now? I'm telling you, the crowd is rough..."
510819, "Damn it... What shall we do now?"
510830, "What started the rumour that the infection is waterborne?"
510831, "Simple minds need no explanations; they need someone to cry wolf-and there you have it. Hysteria is the best justification for believing in any madness."
510832, "Very well. Other than residential property, what other options are there?"
510833, "Are there any places supplied with water at all?"
510836, "My compliments, dear doctor..."
510837, "I'm done. The Cathedral will serve as an isolation ward; the Theatre has become a hospital; the morgue will be located in a remote warehouse. Here are the keys."
510838, "You've given me a bloody world of trouble..."
510839, "Are you aware that the trouble your people went through proved to be absolutely in vain?"
510840, "Please do examine the Cathedral and the Theatre. Issue the appropriate orders. Bring me the keys. Then I'll be ready to confirm your findings and begin working on those places."
510841, "I am so worried about dad..."
510842, "Victoria, what has your father been up to lately?"
510843, "Do you by any chance know where the dead are brought these days?"
510844, "Would you like me to reveal the secret of a miraculous remedy for the Sand Plague? It's dangerous, mind you."
510845, "I'm all ears, Victoria. "
510846, "Have you ever seen antique boxes with chalky or bluish powder inside? It has already fossilized in some of them. Have you already heard of the powders-dubbed 'shmowders' sometimes?"
510847, "I haven't."
510848, "I've heard bits and pieces."
510849, "Tell me. I am eager to hear this story from someone as honest and reasonable as you appear to be."
510850, "The powders are secret remedies that some people have been keeping since the First Outbreak. Before it all started, one boy-his name was Crowfoot, he died later-inspired the children to play epidemic. They were making these powders."
510851, "What is the First Outbreak? "
510852, "So?"
510853, "Wait a minute... Are you saying they used to play epidemic even before the First Outbreak? "
510854, "Indeed... Whoa... I never thought about it like that! What a strange coincidence. Still, that's not important-we won't be able to learn anything from them anyway. The inventors of the game are now in heavens. That is not what I wanted to speak with you about."
510855, "Then speak, Victoria. I'm listening."
510856, "Five years ago a terrible disease broke out and engulfed several houses in the Crude Sprawl. They burst into it in a blink of an eye, like dry paper would. Every single inhabitant was infected immediately. Almost all of them have died, except for several children-who were courageous enough to take the powders. "
510857, "So what's so special about those powders?"
510858, "Some children stole various drugs for their game-they chose the prettiest ones, of course. Then they crushed the pills in a mortar, mixed them, and wrapped the mixtures into the fresh leaves of fragrant Steppe swevery 'for safekeeping'. "
510859, "Are you implying this, ahem, mishmash can help with the Sand Plague? "
510860, "Not always. Every child had a personal secret recipe. No one knows which particular drugs were used; each mixture was different. The most efficient ones were made by Beaker, Flanky, and Catchfly. Crowfoot's powders were also respected-because they were the prettiest."
510861, "Where are these powders now? "
510862, "This is ridiculous... Excuse me, young lady, but this is of no interest to me."
510863, "All over the place. Some are stored in caches in the houses where the children used to play infirmary. The powders were lethally dangerous, you see-if anyone was to take that much drugs, it would damage their health horribly. But the children beg to differ, like they always do. 'They helped once, so what if they do so again?' is the line of reasoning."
510864, "And what do you think?"
510865, "Some of them undoubtedly help. They poison the body, true, but they also poison the Sand Dirt out. I have no idea how it works-perhaps there are antibiotics in the mixture. Others are indeed lethal. And every single one of them is extremely detrimental to your health."
510866, "I have no doubts about that."
510867, "The thing is, the kids were recently reminded of one of the caches. They've pried it open, and now they cannot wait to test the acquired powders in an infected district. Loafer, Beaker's younger brother, has already gone to do the testing, the fool! "
510868, "Fine. I'll find the kid. "
510869, "So they have a whole cache of these powders stocked there, huh?"
510870, "They have probably only taken a few, but they know the places... So they will continue getting more-and getting poisoned again and again. It's a lottery-no one can remember which powder is which, what the recipe was... It's a be cured or die situation."
510871, "All right. We'll drag Loafer out of this. And perhaps I'll find a use for the powders too."
510872, "No, young lady. Not today."
510873, "All right, I'll find this Loafer-if it's not too late already, that is. Show me where he went."
510874, "To the Skinners, the district that's already wholly infected... But I do not know his exact whereabouts! When I banned the tests, they started avoiding me. "
510875, "Never mind. I'll find him. "
510876, "I've found the boy. "
510877, "Is everything all right with him? He's not sick, is he?"
510878, "He's not-he was lucky. I'll find the caches as soon as possible and retrieve the poison."
510879, "Do you know of any other places?"
510880, "Mmm... The only thing I know is that the caches were mostly hidden in suburban houses... but these houses could long have been inhabited by the people coming from the Termitary. I also know that two caches were called the Mild Dew and the Dovecot, but I do not know the locations. Wait, are you going to test them on your own?"
510881, "They might be useful."
510882, "Thank you. You seem to be planning to test them out youself... or am I mistaken?"
510883, "I already have. Apparently, the one I got was efficient..."
510884, "Next time you will not be so lucky."
510885, "We'll see. "
510886, "Soon we'll see who's a coward and who's not..."
510887, "Sticky, who are you after?"
510888, "Do you have any more lockpicks?"
510889, "Do you know how I call the queue for my lockpicks? No-Res-Queue. For me, that is. From the potential clients. It's the longest queue in the world."
510890, "I'll pay."
510891, "Nuts or pills?"
510892, "May I queue up?"
510893, "Isn't money good enough?"
510894, "Come back in two days.The day after tomorrow."
510895, "Very well."
510896, "It is, but I want a lot. Money is cheaper than paper now. How's ten grand for a lockpick? No, wait, that's too much... two grand. Final price. Those are some rare goods."
510897, "Fine."
510898, "No way, it's too much."
510899, "They'll cost even more tomorrow. I'm not here for charity."
510900, "Tomorrow I'll have the money."
510902, "Fine, you win."
510903, ""
510904, "Ouch... "
510905, "Loafer? "
510906, "Nothing! I meant well. I won't do it again."
510907, "Are you testing a powd-erm, shmowder? Tell me the truth! "
510908, "No. I mean yes. I'm a brave boy, aren't I? "
510909, "Let me check if you have a fever. Are you sick yet? "
510910, "I don't know. Doesn't look like it. I've been waiting all this time to fall sick so I could do the test. Nothing so far. Bad luck."
510911, "You nitwit! Spare the rod and spoil the child."
510912, "Give me the box. I'll test it myself. "
510913, "Oh! Actually, you seem to be right... I do have a fever. Let me take the shmowder, will you? "
510914, "Give me the box already, will you? I don't like the prospect of you poisoning yourself."
510916, ""
510917, "Are you here on business?"
510918, "Just looking around."
510919, "In other words, you've bullied her into this, right?"
510920, "Good. The hospital is my primary concern."
510921, "Do you consider a mansion to be an inappropriate place for this? "
510922, "I'll take a look at it. What about other facilities?"
510923, "Why, no... it's fine. As long as the minimal living conditions and the regular sanitary measures are provided."
510924, "I'm glad we've come to an agreement."
510925, "What about the hospital?"
510926, "Discuss the marauders? Exterminating them is Saburov's duty. And he seemed to have enlisted every person who can hold a weapon for the job."
510927, "I will examine the houses you have arranged for. If they meet minimal sanitary requirements, go ahead and start directing the sick there. Later I'll come back here to inform you when it's time to announce the hospital situation to the general public."
510928, "...That would be the people we could use to perform sanitary work... I'm no less annoyed than you. But no, Victor wanted to discuss the... blocked off districts. He seems to have grand ideas regarding them and is seeking your advice. "
510929, "Sure, I'll talk to him. Just do not rush to use the houses you have arranged for before I examine them. I need to be sure everything meets my requirements."
510930, "You seem to be mistaken, good sir; I'm not annoyed at all. I approve of Saburov's decision."
510931, "We didn't have much of a choice, esteemed Bachelor. If you find the results of our endeavors lackluster, then feel free to take our seat and aim for the better. I've no desire to listen to these... reprimands instead of the well-deserved words of praise."
510932, "All right.  Any objections from the current inhabitants of the hospital-to-be?"
510933, "And those special buildings do have access to fresh water?"
510934, "The Cathedral and the Theatre do-they are supplied with spring water. Perhaps you've noticed the small fountains there... The Town Hall is connected to the general supply line... as are other buildings. "
510935, "What about the Termitary? The intricate Tower? "
510936, "For goodness' sake!.. We've talked about this before, haven't we? Unlocking these buildings now would be... quite unwise. I really don't care for your persistence at all. Do you really insist that the streets of the town need a thousand unruly children... and ten thousand rebels scared witless?"
510937, "No. That is not what I want."
510938, "Then let's get back to the sensible discussion."
510939, "So what are your people waiting for? Go ahead and start making arrangements."
510940, "We are indeed incapable of that, doctor. With official authority comes direct responsibility."
510941, "Wait here. I'll be back with the keys."
510942, "There must be someone who can do that for me."
510943, "Fine. Let your people turn the Cathedral into an isolation ward and the Theatre into a hospital-that would even be somewhat symbolic. An appropriate climax of the general lunacy of this whole ordeal!"
510944, "....."
510945, "So what do you think?"
510946, "Keep it locked. Tighten the security."
510948, "Are those your scoundrels running rampant in the warehouse on the other side of the Gullet?"
510949, "They ain't! Must be Barley's..."
510950, "What are they doing there?"
510951, "So that must be the cunts' pesthole, it has to be. Can't you just go 'n off 'em, Doc? Eh?"
510952, "Oh how it hurts to have your neck strangled, it does! The Saburov asshole has ordered his patrols to make 'em Warehouses too hot for us lot, like we ain't no free folks. We're doin' the sufferin' for our fellow men's sins!"
510953, "Oh really? And you are righteous people, I suppose?"
510954, "My folks have never taken knives to the streets! So we had a gatherin' yesterday. Here goes me sayin', 'Anyone knife-hungry is welcome to get the fuck outta here, you ain't no brother to us! We don't want no blood on our hands.' So Barley the Barber did, got up 'n got lost. The cunt went away to slaughter honest folks, and some of us lot went away with him, too!"
510955, "Who's Barley?"
510956, "A filthy bloodsuckin' butcher, that's what he is! He's got one joy-killin' 'em folks. Nothin' is sacred for the cunt. And the rest of 'em bloodthirsty skunks have gone with him, they have! So 'tis for their misdeeds that we endure persecution! 'Tis for their sins that Saburov sets his rabid mongrels after us!"
510957, "I can see that he's hit a raw nerve in you."
510958, "They multiply by the hour, they do, every low fuck in the town wants in on Barley's deal. If only you could find their pesthole and kick them out of there! Eh, Doc? They've cut a dreadful lot of 'em folks, that's where all the innocent blood flows from! I'd do the supplyin' part for you then, you'd be swimmin' in bullets 'n monies. Nothin's too good for a holy cause. Let the cunt bleed dry!"
510959, "We'll see."
510960, "You've got enough sins on your conscience to suffer until the end of days. Stop complaining, thief. "
510961, "Your men aren't much better though, wouldn't you agree?"
510963, "I'll kill them. Both ammo and money would be greatly appreciated."
510964, "Ah, you kindest soul! I swear to you, I won't forget that in forever. As soon as the deed's done, come back here, 'n I'll shower you in gifts. Do I have your honest truest best word?"
510965, "You do. Keep the fee at hand, I'll be back soon."
510966, "I'll tell you when I'm done."
510967, "We'll see about that. I'm not a cutthroat, you know. "
510969, "I need that warehouse."
510970, "It's over, Grief. Your former buddies are no more."
510971, "Now that's what I call a job well done, Doc...! I'll remember not to get on your bad side."
510972, "Fine. I'll kill them. You go ahead and study my modus operandi. Perhaps then you'll know better."
510973, "You promised me something."
510974, "My word is solid, it is. I promised to shower you in gifts, so I will. Here are them monies."
510975, "Do not grieve for it, Grief. Your money will find its way back to you in no time."
510976, "Cheers."
510977, "How do you even picture it? If any bum could come in here and live at your place for a day... they'd drag the infection in with them!"
510978, "A day is too much. The Sand Plague symptoms don't take that long to become apparent, so very few real infected people will be able to make it to this place. They say it's fast as a burn."
510980, "That remains to be proven."
510981, "It's tough, but if that's what has to be done... Then that's fine, I'll make do. There won't be too many patients, even fewer of them strangers... But we're out of water! We need to arrange for it to be delivered. Vlad the Younger can help with that, he knows the local water supply chain like the back of his hand."
510982, "Lara, this is suicide. I'll issue an order to relocate the isolation ward to an abandoned house."
510983, "Don't. It's me who wants the isolation ward to be here. Then people will remember this house and connect its good reputation to our family's name."
510984, "I don't understand..."
510985, "Fine. Have it your way."
510986, "Tell me."
510987, "No! Enough questions, please. I've already told you more than I should have."
510988, "Fine. Have it your way."
510989, "Well, it's not running anymore. I don't know why. The pipes are empty. They produced rusty clotted liquid of reddish colour for a while, but then it was gone too."
510990, "That means no isolation ward in this house, not unless we figure this out. Water is essential for maintaining the proper sanitary conditions."
510991, "Perhaps Vlad the Younger could be of help. He's been making himself busy with waterpipes, wells, and the likes for years... I think it's personal. He treats water as if it was liquid gold-and procures it just as eagerly."
510992, "Who can sort this out?"
510993, "All right, I'll talk to him about it."
510994, "Okay. And hear this: if the Olgimsky couriers come knocking on your door, slam that door in their faces. There will be no isolation ward here as long as there's no water. That's an order."
510995, "Lara, I'm afraid we're about to have a rather difficult talk. Did you know that the water supply has been damaged deliberately?"
510996, "Heavens, no! Who would even consider that?"
510997, "That's what I want you to tell me. With whom did you talk about the water before the supply was cut?"
510998, "I'm not entirely sure... There were many people. I talked to everyone who was helping me with The House of the Living. I must have asked someone to deliver water, of course."
510999, "Who was that?"
511000, "Let me see... Perhaps... Right, I talked about the water with Daddy Yaklakh. He used to be a taskmaster in the Termitary... then he bought himself out and became a patrolman. I did indeed tell him that he should boil water before using it... that it's risky to drink natural water just like that. But I didn't mean any harm!"
511001, "How about the stinking clots? Did you tell anyone about them?"
511002, "The clots? No, I didn't... But, just so that you know, there was this odd clingy lady in Earth terrorizing everyone with questions about bloody clots in the water... Perhaps she may know something?"
511003, "How about you give it another round of thought? Malicious gossip has it that the people that have destroyed the town's water supply did so at your instigation."
511004, "I know. Her name is Aspity. It was she who claimed that you were the person to inspire some simple-hearted fool to destroy the water line."
511005, "Well, that's a no-brainer, a newborn baby knows that. No one could have gone rampant destroying the town's water supply chain because of this rather straightforward information."
511006, "He also asked me whether one should boil the rags and bedsheets that the infected were dying on. I remember it weirded me out a bit-why would he ask me about bedsheets? He's a patrolman, not a laundry person... "
511007, "What did you tell him?"
511008, "Why?"
511009, "Of course I told him he should do that! He's from the Kin, you see. He had to be explained the benefits of boiling water. So I did my best to describe to him how that is useful-and essential to hygiene."
511010, "Makes sense. You did nothing wrong."
511011, "You really shouldn't have."
511012, "Sounds weird indeed. I feel like I come by Aspity once more..."
511019, "What does the local water supply look like?"
511020, "It exists; there even is a water supply system-which is in itself quite amazing, don't you think? It was constructed after the fire, at the same time as the Termitary. The water pumps you've doubtlessly noticed in the streets are also connected to it. But that's not all."
511021, "What else?"
511022, "There are several springs inside the town and in the surrounding Steppe. They all have beautiful names in the local language. Three of them are in the town: by the Cathedral, by the Theatre, and... well, the third one was ruined during the construction of the Bull Project. It dried up."
511023, "There must be some wells too."
511024, "What are their names?"
511025, "The Stone Yard spring is called Golgur. The etymology of the word is unclear, but it means something along the lines of 'a smooth mouthful'. The Spin-a-Yarn Square spring is called Typkhe, which simply means 'a well'. The ruined spring was called Sugagh Khadugh."
511026, "I see. So the three of them are still supplying water, right? Or is it only two?"
511027, "When Sugagh Khadugh was crushed, it flowed underground, but then returned to the surface. The locals maintain that it was angry with people, so it's chosen an evil place to do that. Popped out like a varicose vein in a place dramatically unfit for producing drinking water: by the cemetery, the Rotten Field, and the Khato dead pile."
511029, "What about the wells situation in the town?"
511030, "Sadly, no wells; that's another local taboo that is most likely going to make your work harder. This is all quite unfortunate, wouldn't you agree? But well-digging is forbidden around here. The consequences can be very harsh."
511031, "That's... unique. What is this thing before me then?"
511032, "Why?"
511033, "This is a secret. And I seem to be close to unravelling it."
511034, "Do many people know about your well?"
511035, "In theory, no one, but I suspect that in practice many do. The only reason I haven't been buried inside of it is the lenience of the current Foreman of the Abattoir. But father has a stranglehold on him, which is quite a feat in itself."
511036, "Very well. How do you propose to solve the water supply issue?"
511037, "What are you expecting to dig out?"
511038, "Oh, you'd definitely make fun of me if I told you, so don't even try to guess."
511039, "Gold?"
511040, "Of the liquid kind."
511041, "Surely it's not oil?"
511042, "Earth's blood? You could put it that way. Like I said, do not guess, doctor. This has nothing to do with our current problem."
511043, "Fine. Let's get back to that."
511044, "Am I really the person who is supposed to solve it?"
511045, "I'm counting on your assistance."
511046, "Not you, of course. Your father."
511047, "Oh. That changes everything. My father and I are one and the same. At the very least, you can always count on me when it comes to his duties before the town."
511048, "So what do you think?"
511049, "If I were you, I'd seize the Cathedral and the Theatre as soon as possible; those buildings have access to spring water. Although, with dangerous zealots popping up, the town's springs are to be feared for as well. Who knows what those idiots will think up next... Are you planning to find them, by the way?"
511050, "Of course."
511051, "Let Saburov handle it. Chasing outlaws and halfwits is his job."
511052, "Water deliveries clearly need to be arranged. But since we need to set up a hospital... and all those plague facilities... I'm afraid we can only carry water from the Sugagh Khadugh spring. Yes, that would be a bit better than trying purified water from Gorkhon's tributaries."
511053, "The Sugagh Khadugh spring?"
511054, "All right, far be it from me to insist. So what shall we do?"
511055, "They're very likely to be hiding in the same dens as the runaway rebels-which does, by the way, give you food for thought... but nevermind that. In any case, it would make sense to speak with Aspity... It would be rather disappointing to die of thirst while everyone is busy dying of the Sand Plague."
511056, "Let's do our best to make sure nobody dies of thirst."
511057, "Everything's in your hands."
511058, "I'll order to start arranging water deliveries and post guards at the Sugagh Khadugh spring. It won't be enough for the whole town, but it's better than nothing. You should hurry up and seize the springs at the Stone Yard and Spin-a-Yarn Square-that is, the Cathedral's and the Theatre's springs."
511059, "Not just find, but properly punish them too."
511060, "Agreed. Those who would doom the town to die of thirst are bound for the Bone Stake. Whoever is behind this atrocity, there shall be no mercy for them. Not even if it turns out to be my own sister."
511061, "Where do you think the criminals could be hiding?"
511062, "Let's do it then."
511063, "Thanks for your help."
511064, ""
511065, "Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat... Can you hear the kids running around?"
511066, "Aspity, you know already I'm not a man to be trifled with. Who destroyed the water supply?"
511067, "Oh look at me, trembling with fear! Do you think, serpentongue, that trifling with you is any fun? So the guy lost his temper, big deal. It's not his fault! He's a simple worker. He was put up to do this."
511068, "By whom?"
511069, "Well... A lady of some importance. I don't think it would be too wrong to assume that's she's hiding her real face from the majority. It definitely wouldn't be too wrong to assume that the lily-white daughter of the executed captain Ravel knows the answer."
511070, "It's you who are the serpentongue. An asp that spits poison with every word she utters."
511071, "Are you trying to say it was Lara who's... inspired this..."
511072, "Who is that man? I want to see him."
511073, "Who cares. I want to know the name."
511074, "I don't turn people like him in! What's this new fad of yours anyway, attributing the sins of the malignant and the smart to the speechless and the mute! It's engineers, politicians, and prophets that come up with the ways to invite evil into our world, yet somehow it's the scum that simply cannot withstand the temptation that has to take the consequences. How is that fair? Huh?"
511075, "Don't try to pull wool over my eyes. Who's destroyed the water intake?"
511076, "Go ahead and interrogate Lara the angel. As for me, I'm done here! I'm hungry myself. It's a pity that I won't see you drive the poor poor sufferer into a corner. Oh how I hate this tender dove type! If only I could sink my teeth into her slender white neck!"
511077, "I can't imagine Lara putting anyone up to do that."
511078, "Everyone will get the punishment they deserve."
511079, "What a bitch you are! Slandering an innocent person! Where's Yaklakh? "
511080, "Clara the thief, on the other hand, turned out to be a saint! Huge loads of miracles she performed yesterday, a ton of people healed by her hands! Unbelievable, isn't it...? See? I am willing to admit the virtues of blessed girls-as long as they prove their sainthood with deeds done."
511081, "We'll sort this Clara out later."
511082, "Everything happens..."
511083, "Ha ha. I slandered no one. Have I said a single bad word about Lara? I told you she'd drop you the name-and she did. No one said the lady of importance was her. An orphan, a captain's daughter... I didn't mean her at all, you hear me? And fancy that, calling me a bitch! Compensating for something with the strong language, are we?"
511084, "I need the taskmaster."
511085, "So who's the lady then?"
511086, "I'm telling you, the taskmaster is not to blame. He tried to do the good thing. It was explained to him loud and clear that the disease comes from water. It was a good deed! No one should drink that water! How many times do I have to tell you? Do you think I'm joking? It's bloody and poisonous!"
511087, "I'm not gonna tell you. I'm not a snitch! And it's too late anyway. Everyone overreacted. No one had malicious intentions. The Gorkhon's water is bad, and I'm glad it won't be drunk. We'll make do with the springs and the water we've stocked up on. Let them poison themselves with twyrine, it will all end soon enough anyway."
511088, "I'm asking you for the last time. Where's Yaklakh? I won't hurt him, I only want to ask him a few questions."
511089, "I'm asking you for the last time. Where's Yaklakh? I won't hurt him, I only want to ask him a few questions."
511090, "He's back in the Termitary. I helped him escape your anger. He was terrified thinking you'd find him and torture him to death. You may not be completely aware of this, but you instill terror in many people instead of love and respect."
511091, "I know. It's a pity."
511092, "Not a big deal. Terror is respect."
511093, "Go make a try, perhaps you'll catch up with him. The Termitary appears to be unlocked-but it won’t stay unlocked for long. Run, fast Bachelor, run... Catch him by the tail!"
511094, "It's not the last you see of me."
511095, ""
511097, "Tell me. This is of special interest to me because of the ongoing search for buildings that could serve as sanitary wards."
511098, "Indeed. You're reading my thoughts. The Skinners have died out. Supposedly, it has become entirely free of infection. The streets, the walls, the various objects and even the corpses; everything is clean. People can safely touch bodies that only recently were a very strong source of infection..."
511099, "How is this known?"
511100, "The news was brought from looters who have been all over the district grabbing... abandoned property. I've already given the orders to deal with them, but only you can ascertain that the homes really are disease-free."
511101, "Well, let patrolmen deal with the looters."
511102, "If these rumours are true, we'll start making the abandoned homes ready for their new tenants. I can foresee us soon needing to find room for refugees from other infected districts. We'll give them provisional lodging at the vacant houses. I'm sure you understand that in order to make such a risky decision, I must be absolutely certain..."
511103, "Why are you interested in these rumours?"
511104, "Yes, that does seem to fit with the discovery I made yesterday..."
511105, "What can I do to help?"
511106, "Take a look around the Skinners. Check inside the houses. If they truly are clean, find something that could prove it. And of course, you may use any abandoned property as you see fit. Better you get it than the looters."
511107, "Yes, that's promising. I'll be back with a report."
511108, "It's dangerous. I'll take my time to think it over."
511109, "I don't wish to think that we are being eaten alive... But given how fast it's spreading, that just might be true."
511110, "I've decided to inspect that boarded-up district after all."
511111, "Thank you. I'll await your verdict."
511112, "I'll be back soon."
511113, "I have inspected the district. I'll take it upon myself to confirm that the rumours are true. The district is clean. And a little freer of looters now."
511114, "Good tidings! This will help ease the fate of the epidemic's latest victims."
511115, "Even better than you think. If we can prevent unnecessary commotion and keep the healthy in isolation wards, we'll stop the disease. It will burn out like a forest fire."
511116, "Are you now certain that the disease doesn't stay dormant in an infected person for a while before revealing itself? I dare not doubt your expertise... However, until we have established the origin of the infection, it's too early to declare the enemy defeated."
511118, "Yes, you're right. But the ward will become operational soon. I hope you won't be offended, but it's going to be set up in the town's Cathedral. I have very high hopes for the facility."
511119, "Indeed? Well, it was conceived as a shelter for those in need. Now it can finally fulfil its intended function."
511120, "Those who enter may potentially be carrying the seed of the corruption in them. But only the clean will leave."
511121, ""
511122, "Every single day brings me closer to the solution."
511123, "I visited one of the boarded off quarters."
511124, "Any new developments?"
511125, "I have modified my initial compound. Regrettably, I have to keep working with the same microbial culture-and it's getting depleted... But my medicine is getting more potent all the same. It's a pity I cannot test it on someone. Observing its effects would have confirmed that I am moving in the right direction."
511126, "Give me a sample. I'll test the solution."
511127, "Well done! Did you find anything there, apart from marauders and looters?"
511128, "The worst of all criminals was nowhere to be seen. The killer has disappeared. Vanished into thin air."
511129, "So our hypothesis is supported? The killer is indeed a bacterium, isn't it? There is hope then. You were right."
511130, "Indeed. The microbe cannot survive in a non-organic environment. The walls of infected buildings and sometimes the ground itself were covered in some peculiar organic matter that was dying as fast as it was spreading. I would be very interested to study this filth at a laboratory."
511131, "Sadly, all we can study now are these... half-dead scraps. I don't think that what we can observe is reflective of how a full-fledged bacterium will behave. The best we can do is guess... but there will be a day when we nail down the culprit and grip it with an iron fist!"
511132, "I hope it doesn't take long."
511133, "Yes... Just our bloody luck!"
511134, "How about I don't touch you? You do, I can feel it from here."
511136, "I've changed my mind. Is there any way we could help each other? Any ideas?"
511137, "You're influential with Olgimsky. Use that influence. Tell him to stop persecuting the runaways. It's no longer a revenge situation-but he's still all too eager... Takes the guy quite some time to calm down, huh? "
511138, "Fine."
511139, "It's not over yet."
511140, "Indeed."
511141, "I doubt anyone apart from me will agree to help you. What should I do?"
511142, "We need the body of someone who succumbed to the Sand Pest, or at least a part of it. Talk to the governor-he will advise you how you can gain access to a dead body. I have no doubt he will trust you more than he would anyone else."
511143, "Very well, let us try."
511147, "Anger is a poor companion for a noble man..."
511148, "This house has long become the secret shelter for the Bull Project workers that have angered Vlad the Heavy somehow. Runaway butchers go there too..."
511149, "I'll keep that in mind, Judge."
511151, "The first step is appropriately idiotic... I need to inform the governor of my plans. He has to give me official permission to perform post-mortem autopsy on the victims of the disease."
511152, "Aspity is willing to sacrifice three butchers, provided that boös Olgimsky grants pardon to the rest of them."
511153, "Come nightfall, a Steppe creature called the Albino will appear here."
511154, "Mark invited me to come by."
511155, "Father doesn't hesitate to damn those who have sinned, but he can grant pardon just as easily. I can beg him to forgive Stamatin."
511156, "An all-too-curious urchin called Loafer is looking for trouble somewhere in this area."
511157, "People like your father are the last to get exposed to danger. It's the poor who die first."
511158, "SILENT HOUSE KEY. This key matches the lock on a certain infected house. Can definitely serve as proof of the threat of an epidemic."
511159, "CORPSE BLOOD. This blood must be analyzed, although the current conditions make any thorough analysis impossible. There's a high chance that it contains a sample of the harmful microorganism."
511160, "I've found the boy... but got infected in the process... "
511161, "I warned you! Didn't I?"
511162, "Yeah, I should've listened to you..."
511163, ""
511164, "We will bring order to this place with an iron fist!"
511174, "I hope so."
511175, "Crime is seriously getting out of hand! Where are all those scoundrels coming from? It's as if their numbers double every hour... Knives everywhere! It's time to put an end to them. We should catch Grief and have him executed. Make an example of him for challenging the new order."
511176, "What did Grief do to upset you so?"
511177, "His men are murdering civilians in the streets. All the crimes commited in the town right now are commited under his consent; some-under his direct orders."
511178, "So who's going to do it?"
511179, "A group of patrolmen attempted a raid this morning, but they failed to catch the thieves off guard. Grief's gang managed to fight them off. I can't gather a new party immediately-there's not even enough men to cordon off the infected districts and curb looting."
511180, "So what's keeping you from going after him?"
511181, "So who's going to stop them?"
511182, "Any brave soul who manages to put a stop to their rampage will receive a sizable reward. I shall pay thirty thousand for such a feat. If this keeps on, I'll start giving rewards for every dead criminal. At any cost, by whatever means this bloodbath needs to be stopped!"
511185, "I'll deal with them myself."
511186, "The patrols will deal with them sooner or later."
511187, "Grief insists that he has nothing to do with it. The murderers are misfits that he cast out of his community."
511188, "Are you sure?"
511189, "He swears that he has forbidden anyone who is still loyal to the ancient tradition of their brotherhood, from touching a knife. The murderers are not warehouse men, they're allies of some Barley the Barber."
511190, "Yes, I've heard that name. His men ambushed and slaughtered the patrolmen near the boiler house. We need to hunt him down and kill him, then. Better yet-hunt him down and thoroughly interrogate him. See if he confirms Grief's words."
511191, "Barley will be killed."
511192, "Let's leave Grief alone for now. Order your patrolmen to track down this Barley's hideout."
511193, "Are you sure they're his men at all?"
511194, "Are you sure they're his men at all?"
511195, "What's your plan?"
511196, "Tell me more about the fight."
511197, "There was a group of about thirty patrolmen. That's a lot, considering how valuable every volunteer is. The number of killers grows by the hour, while noble people are harder and harder to come by... The gang suffered heavy losses. But they ambushed my people..."
511198, "I thought few locals would dare take up a knife."
511199, "That's correct. This lack of authority is bewitching to them. This violation of an ages-long taboo. It's like a mass hysteria."
511200, "This need to be stopped."
511201, "Do something then!"
511202, ""
511203, "I'm glad I see you're still alive..."
511204, "Where did all these bandits come from? Were they hiding before or something?"
511205, "I'm mortified myself.... This epidemic turns people into bloodthirsty monsters... But I don't think Bad Grief has anything to do with it... Though my spouse won't listen to me... He thinks I'm only saying this out of... false compassion..."
511206, "This has to be stopped."
511207, "Punitive measures are unlikely to help... You can't beat evil with evil... That's a textbook maxim... Only the courage of the volunteeres can hold back the abusive behaviour... of the desperate cowards..."
511208, "They deserve to be killed. The sense of security and the freedom to do anything is exactly what drives this kind of people nuts."
511209, "Fair enough."
511210, ""
511211, "How's it going, chief?"
511212, "Do you know where Barley the Barber is hiding?"
511213, "We’ve found their lair, but I'm not telling you where it is."
511214, "Why?"
511215, "You want to deal with them on your own and get the reward Maria promised, don't you? It's written all over your face. Well, we want the reward for ourselves. Maria's favours don't grow on trees. She's Khan's sister, after all."
511216, "So what are you intending to do?"
511217, "We'll storm Barley's lair and take all his loot! And we're not going to be punished too. Those who dare to cut up bodies aren't human; they're worse than shabnak. A good way to mess with that Grief sod, too. Let him owe us. So it's a win-win. We're not telling you where Barley is hiding."
511218, "As you wish. I'll find him anyway."
511219, "Don't even think of attacking them on your own! You'll be better off just running head first into a wall."
511220, "Yes, she is Khan's sister; what of it?"
511221, "We're at odds with Khan. His friends don't like my Soul-and-a-Halves, and the feeling is mutual. I like Maria though. Khan, by the way, would jump through any hoop on Maria's order. Do you think I'd miss a chance like that? The only person who can control Khan owing me? "
511222, "I see. "
511223, "I already know where it is."
511224, "Like hell you do. You must be thinking it's in the Warehouses, right? That's where the barbers' main den is, but Barley himself is hiding in town. He made himself a hideout far away from here. The stolen money flows all the way there."
511225, "Well, it's up to you to decide."
511226, ""

511229, "They're filling the streets like earthworms after rain. And no one, not a single person dares oppose them... Disgraceful! If someone were to end them, I would grant a wish for that person on a Sunday! People that know me realize how much that entails..."

511251, "So who is doing the checking then?"
511252, "Are you implying no one is? You are wrong. Brother has found some people who have agreed to test the new drugs. Lara was in charge of it, Anna agreed to help her, so did Yulia, and finally Eva volunteered as well. All in all, they are all busy with it."

511259, "I'd rather you didn't. The best assistance you can offer is not taking risks."

511261, "My god, I'd turn myself inside out for you!"
511262, "Aren't you afraid?"
511263, "Sure I am... You know, they say the disease is actually sentient. It doesn't merely spread-it acts as though it was a living being! It covers its tracks, conceals itself, lies in ambush, attacks the weak and the unprotected-and steers clear of the strong and the courageous. Or dares not attack them staight away at least. I'd rather be among the courageous..."
511264, "What makes you say that? "
511265, "Have you noticed how few lethal cases there were among the patrolmen? Or those... funeral attendants who borrowed props from the Theatre? Almost none of them are dead! Death only comes after those who are trying to hide! It knocks on your head, knocks from the inside... having appeared within you... it's not an external affliction. Is it?"
511266, "Stop talking nonsense, Eva, please! You're acting like a little girl."
511267, "I'm confused... So why did they?"
511268, "Vlad the Younger found commoners willing to test old Isidor's drugs-supposedly he took those for protection before entering moulded houses. The ladies were put in charge of the whole affair, entrusted with keeping an eye on the experiment. And then here they go-claiming they are going to do just fine without anyone's help. Can you imagine that?"
511269, "I'll be damned! I have personally forbidden anyone to take risks! This whole thing has to be cancelled."
511270, "So what's the catch?"
511271, "The catch is they're waiting for you! They picture you running your feet off to appreciate their last hour. And I'm sure that deep within their hearts they can't wait to see you come, forbid any risky attempts on their part and offer to test the pills yourself."
511272, "Oh no, I knew you would say that... What can I do to make you forget it and stay here?"
511273, "They're absolutely right then. This is exactly what I'm going to do."

511320, "I don't think that a positive outcome falls within the range of reasonable possibility. There is no point whatsoever in trying to attain it. All we can do now is wait and hope that, by some miraculous coincidence, the epidemic will pass us by. "
511321, "Do tell me, how exactly are you planning to test these... antibiotics?"
511322, "Oh, so you know it already? I need to contract the disease first, and then try to cure myself. I have three kinds of pills, you see. Conceivably, any one of the medicines may curb the sickness at a certain stage of its development. An exciting experiment if I ever saw one; not quite unlike the feats of power they had in times long-forgotten. A trial of fate!"
511323, "Still, Yulia, why are you so intent on doing the testing personally?"
511324, "Didn't I tell you before? I am testing one of my theories; a hypothesis that destiny may be manipulated. As adventurous as I may be, I am anything but irresponsible. I am much better equipped to conduct this kind of research than that poor tanner may ever hope to be. I will be able to keep a journal of my observations, my physical sensations, the change of my body temperature... If nothing else, I won't mix up the medicine."
511328, "Nothing revolutionary, I assure you. The experiment is, fundamentally, getting myself infected and using the three medicinal formulas one after the other. Besides, the Olgimsky girl provided me with a 'shmowder' that I am to use if neither of the pills has effect. Absolutely precious, these shmowders. Extremely detrimental for your liver, but also certain to remove the infection. Everything will work out just fine, I hope."
511329, "What medicine were you given?"
511330, "Here. It is called feromycinum. The most powerful medicant they had in stock, as well as the most hazardous. Known to purge the bacteria by means of destroying all manner of microflora; harmful and otherwise. If it proves to be of use, the Olgimsky family will distribute it throughout the town."
511331, "Is that all?"
511332, "There's two more medicants; neomycinum and monomycinum. Reportedly, both are much weaker than the first, but each one has useful characteristics of its own. I wouldn't know what kind of characteristics these are; pharmaceutics is not my field of study."
511333, "That's enough. I'll do this myself."
511343, ""

511346, "Anna, tell me, what's the deal with this drug testing of yours?"
511347, "We were made to test some strange pills. Yulia, for example, is supposed to enter an infected house, get sick there, and die! How's that for a test, huh?"
511348, "I seem to be missing the point of such a test."
511353, "She's supposed to test some sort of antibiotic. Her task is to become infected and then treat herself with it. If the drug fails, her only option is to cure herself at the last moment with a diabolical concoction, that mismash children's thing. The one that works best if you need to send an adolescent to an early grave; Capella's almost done it twice."
511354, "And what's your task?"
511355, "Oh, I'd never have the guts to take part in this mad effort! But those poor souls... they'll soon come by here, and then they'll go to yet another infected house to face certain death. They'll be held in there for several hours under lock and key, taking some sort of drug that will supposedly protect them from the infection... if it's good, that is."
511356, "How will you know if it's good or bad?"
511357, "That's precisely the madness part! Vlad made the death-seekers promise that if they do get sick, they'll let us know through the morticians-you know, the fellows who have been walking around in theatre costumes. And if all goes well, they'll inform their contact-and for some reason that's me. What do I have to do with it?"
511358, "What kind of drug did you receive?"
511359, "I've been given three different drugs. They all ruin your health, but each does that in its own spectacular manner."
511360, "Give them to me-I'll do the testing."
511362, "I wish you the best of luck. Hopefully everything goes well."
511365, "What antibiotic? Show me."
511367, "'Made to'? Vlad told me you volunteered."
511368, "Yes, made to! It was all fixed by the Olgimskys. Vlad is secretly plotting to ruin me and Yulia; he's fond of Lara though, so she's got something silly and non-threatening-morphine, I believe. It doesn't even require testing! Morphine doesn't have anything to do with the infection!"
511369, "But why are you so scared? It's the volunteers who will be doing the real testing, right?"
511375, "...And now Anna has urgent business to discuss too..."
511376, "Are you still looking for the body? I'd like to help you with the search."
511378, "I promise."
511379, "When the house of Kains faces trouble, Victor is the person to deal with the practical side of things. He has already collected the data that may help me find the body."
511380, "Victor believes Vlad the Younger could provide me with some clues. He did business with Rubin-so perhaps he might know where Stakh could have taken the body."
511381, "*****"
511382, "Yes... "
511384, "Victor should leave the Termitary be for the time being and stop demanding an inspection. Then Vlad the Younger will disclose the possible body-snatcher hideout."
511385, "Let's take a look at the Polyhedron, shall we? If that enclave is in order, then the symmetrical Termitary enclave should also be fine. That's the Olgimskys' reasoning anyway."
511386, "I can inform Vlad the Younger that the barter went through successfully. The Olgimskys have left the Polyhedron be, and the Kains have stopped trying to get into the Termitary. Everyone's happy."
511387, "Anna, the current owner of the Willows, knows where to look for the proof of an outbreak."
511388, "Capella knows everything that the fidgety children stumble upon. And they seem to have stumbled upon something disturbing... "
511389, "This is where a boy named Sticky lives. Together with some friends he has found some foul place. I really hope it's not a house stuffed with dead bodies..."
511390, "Olgimsky must acknowledge the authority of the new governor."
511391, "Georgiy Kain must acknowledge the authoruty of the new governor."
511392, "Okay, I've made up my mind. Let's get out of here!"
511393, "Then hurry up and tell Andrey! Or else he'll drink himself cockeyed again and we won't get any help from him."
511394, "Wait here."
511395, "They say you saw some significant success yesterday. So random antibiotics really can help against the Sand Fever?"
511396, "How is the distribution of drugs going? Why is there still no medicine in the town?"
511397, "The drugs we confiscated two days ago turned out to be outdated; moreover, many are expired and now harmful. Many are probably useless. We will check every drug today. Those that actually prove effective will be put into distribution immediately."
511398, "How will the tests be conducted?"
511399, "I've found some people with a death wish... Those are desperate people on the verge of a nervous breakdown. And so I have tasked several young ladies, whom you probably know, with supervising the tests. They are Eva Yan, Yulia Lyuricheva, Anna Angel, and Lara Ravel. They'll report the results tonight."
511400, "Why haven't you told me anything?"
511401, "You were very busy yesterday, and we spent the whole day inspecting and writing down the requisitioned stockpiles. Today, as you can see, I'm informing you of my plans... Don't worry, Bachelor. This is the best possible course of action. Or do you have a better one?"
511408, "I sincerely hope you don't, master Vlad."
511409, "Couldn't you supervise the experiment yourself?"
511410, "The young ladies offered their help voluntarily-with the task that I believe to be the least dangerous. I doubt they'd prefer to test the drugs themselves instead of sending death-seekers into infected districts."
511411, "And if they will?"
511412, "Woe is us then. Maybe there's still time to change their minds. But Bachelor, if they do conduct the tests on themselves, we can at least be certain of their failure or success."
511413, "You're not an easy man to read, master Vlad. Don't worry. I'll handle it all myself."
511414, "Then why entrust them with such an important task?"
511415, "Don’t worry. Trust the young ladies-and me. Even if something goes wrong, we will only lose a few hours."
511416, "But we don't have an hour to lose."
511417, "I'll distribute the pills among the tradespeople all right, but what if they return to me all infected? Come on, this is a conveniently roundabout murder-and nothing else. Those poor souls were also picked from death row. That's what I call 'Olgimsky-style'!"
511419, "I still don't understand what you three have to do with this. Why can't Vlad see to the volunteers himself?"
511421, "That does sound strange..."
511422, "They're getting back at me for refusing to hand over my pills back then... As if I was obliged to, as if it was in any way fair to make me! Perhaps they even think I knew about the disaster beforehand? That I'm behind it?"
511423, "Wait. And why did you have such a hefty stockpile of pills of all shapes and sizes, Anna?"
511424, "Show me what you've ben given."
511425, "Just in case. What's it to you? I could've just as easily been stockpiling water."
511426, "Someone stockpiling water is probably expecting to get very thirsty very soon..."
511427, "Mind your tone, or this conversation is over."
511428, "What drugs have you got?"
511429, "So... What does the process that you have in mind look like?"
511435, "Tell me, are you really planning to test antibiotics? "
511436, "No, I'm not."
511437, "Vlad the Younger claims that he asked you to test some dubious remedies."
511438, "I wanted to try the antibiotics, but... I wasn't allowed to. I'll have to work with painkillers. Vlad the Younger says they're closer to my line of trade anyway; if I'm to host The House of the Living, I'll have to handle them often. They ease pain, but also make you drowsy and apathetic..."
511439, "How exactly are you planning to test them anyway?"
511440, "I know how they work. All I need to do is find a man whose line of work naturally leads to being wounded frequently. I was planning to distribute the drugs among the patrolmen, but I could rather give them to you if you wish... If you have any success testing each of the three types, then that means they're still fine. Then the Olgimskys will begin giving them out to the population."
511441, "Fine."
511442, "You know what? There's something else I want to ask of you. Please put a stop to Yulia's efforts and support Anna! Yulia has her own motives, yet I have a terrible suspicion she may have given up to despair... and poor Anna doesn't deserve this either. I'm absolutely positive that she isn't planning to offer the medicine assigned to her to the test subjects-she's too compassionate for that... but she won't go anywhere herself either."
511443, "What's wrong with Anna?"
511444, "She is certain the Olgimskys are only doing this to get to her... and to have her dead. She might not be all that wrong."
511445, "Oh really?"
511446, "I don't think it's Big Vlad... Yet the Olgimskys are definitely a threat to her! There isn't a shade of doubt in anyone's mind that one of them will become the death of her. "
511447, "I see. Okay, now please hand over the painkillers-they'll be of use to me."
511448, "More fortune-telling... Go ahead and distribute the painkillers among the patrolmen."
511449, "That's fine, they'll be of more use to the patrolmen."
511450, "Hmm... Have I been misinformed?"
511451, "And who told you about me?"
511452, "Olgimsky."
511453, "Yulia is the one to test the antibiotics. She'll administer them to the infected and watch the recovery process... or rather the battle inside their immune systems. It's very dangerous! She's even been provided this horrible children's powder-in case she accidently catches the disease and the antibiotics prove to be useless."
511454, "What are you going to test then?"
511455, "And how exactly are you planning to conduct the test? You're completely healthy!"
511456, "Nonsense. These don't help; they kill. Anyway, where are you going to test them?"
511457, "They identified another infected house last night. The building was locked down and cordoned off. From what I know, the plan is to test immunity boosters in the environment conducive to infection. There is some kind of mildew all over the house, I have heard, or some manner of sporiferous mould..."
511458, "Show me the antibiotics."
511464, "Neither is it mine, I'm afraid. I wish you the best of luck."
511467, "Much obliged. I am almost not afraid at all."
511468, "Nevertheless, I'd send a suicide tester, if I were you."
511469, "Nevertheless, Yulia, I'd rather step in for you. Give me your capsules."
511470, "Thank you. For some reason, I fail to muster up the courage..."
511471, "It's only natural."
511472, "Even if there is indeed no hope, admitting that is a crime."
511473, "Give me your pills, Anna. I'll go to the infected house myself."
511474, "Oh, but you'd be all locked up there! You'd have to spend a lot of time inside... and it's not like it's obligatory! Just distribute the first portion and check on the outcome... we'll live and see just how effective they are."
511475, "Weren't you saying they're dangerous? No, I will not have that. Please kindly hand the pills over."
511476, "I've changed my mind. Please do hand over that morphine of yours-or what was it? It'll provide useful for me today."
511477, "It's not just morphine, there are also etorphine and novocaine. Take them."
511478, "Thank you. And remember, no going outside!"
511479, "And nothing ever will, don't worry."
511480, "Unfortunately, they're quite useless."
511481, "Lara has provided Olgimsky with a place for a public isolation ward-her own house. I need to inspect the building."
511482, "According to Olgimsky, this abandoned warehouse will become the morgue."
511483, "Vlad the Younger is more knowledgeable about the local water supply than anyone else in the town."
511485, "BREAD. A piece of stale bread. Hard as rock, but with no signs of mould. Unlikely to be dangerous, but rumour has it that it can be."
511486, "So who's going to stop them?"
511487, "I need to talk to Bad Grief about the thieves' rowdiness. The governor is planning to end their abuse shortly and swiftly."
511489, "I've seen what's happening in the streets. There's truly no escape from the robbers. You're right. I will help you crush them."
511490, "Wonderful. Do not hesitate to kill them. I can't give out a reward for every outlaw killed-my coffers are almost empty. But your reputation will only benefit from this, of that I assure you."
511491, "I need a weapon."
511492, "Everybody's asking for weapons! I've already told you that we don't have any. Even a knife will cost a fortune now. I can only issue to you what little our valiant patrolmen can requisition from the populace."
511493, "Give me anything you have."
511494, "This Barley is hiding somewhere in Earth, among the factory buildings. There aren't so many warehouses there... I'll find this lair of lawlessness-better late than never..."
511495, "The barbers' lair is destroyed. Everyone I found there is dead."
511496, "Good! We shall root out crime with extreme prejudice!"
511497, "That won't be enough. Many say that there are now hundreds of robbers. That one in five leaves their home knife in hand at night."
511498, "They're driven to this by despair and the lack of order. There are plenty of bad examples turning townsfolk into killers. Fear shall be our weapon. When those family men see how mercilessly we deal with murderers, they'll think twice before touching a knife."
511499, "If only it were that simple..."
511500, "I wish to reward your heroism. I hope you will accept this money-perhaps it will at least partially compensate the unavoidable expenses that come with your dangerous work."
511501, "Yes, I will."
511502, "No. I don't need anything."
511503, "One of the local ladies, Aspity, has been saying peculiar things about the local water supply for a while now."
511504, "Aspity suggests that this insane sabotage could have originated from Lara herself. I can't believe this..."
511505, "No, I can't hear anything."
511506, "Aspity was mocking me! Of course Lara is innocent-the uneducated mob has merely misinterpreted her words. But why did she do it?! It's like she was trying to buy time... for what?"
511507, "I need to inform Olgimsky about the sabotage. It brings all his efforts to naught."
511508, "Perhaps there are other public buildings-apart from the Cathedral and the Theatre-that might suit our needs?"
511509, "Like the Termitary? Or my factories? "
511510, "Like any other place."
511511, "Speak to my offspring. He knows these matters better than I do."
511512, "Why not?"
511513, "I'm tired of talking this matter over and over. Unlocking the Termitary means dealing a death sentence to several thousands of people. You have my word."
511514, "Word of honour?"
511515, "Word of honour. "
511516, "Fine. I believe you."
511517, "I already did."
511518, "Then there's nothing else I can do for you, I'm afraid..."
511519, "As usual."
511520, "CATHEDRAL KEY. Now the building can be inspected and appropriated for sanitary needs if it really does have water. Hopefully, it won't be seen as sacrilege-the Cathedral doesn't seem to be functional... Maybe this is why things turned out as they did?"
511521, "THEATRE KEY. Now the building can be inspected and appropriated for sanitary needs. The Theatre is the heart of the town. Its transformation into a hospital will be symbolic in a way. Instead of solemn Mask plays it shall now perform guignol."
511522, "The keeper of the Cathedral keys hangs somewhere around the backstreets of this district."
511523, "The keeper of the Theatre keys hangs somewhere around this ruin."
511524, "Vlad the Younger has commissioned Yulia to organize drug testing. Nothing good will come of it..."
511525, "Lara Ravel agreed to partake in the drug testing. A very questionable choice."
511526, "Vlad the Younger has commissioned Anna to test dubious medicine. A misguided decision if I've ever seen one."
511527, "You're here at last! Damn my position... I have no choice but to hide from the townsfolk, see? I understand their anger, but they have armed search parties to hunt me down, as if I were spreading the plague rather than trying my best to stop it!"
511528, "Any good news?"
511529, "Oh yes. We won't be able to produce a full-fledged vaccine in these conditions, true, but with a little bit of luck we'll succeed to make a reliable preventive formula. Admittedly, the effect of the injection won't last longer than ten hours or so... Still, if it proves effectual, many lives will be saved!"
511530, "What exactly are you planning to do?"
511550, "So now what?"
511551, "Now I'll begin to produce the vaccine. I wonder how many hearts it would take to make enough doses...?"
511552, "The technology itself is what matters. We'll report our findings to the Inquisitor and let him get the components. After all, is it not the reason he was delegated here...?"
511553, "Fair enough. Come tomorrow, early in the morning. Or even tonight; the vaccine should be ready for testing."
511554, "How is it going to work?"
511555, "I don't know yet. The solution needs to be tested. However, given that it's not really a vaccine, but rather a preventive medicine, I would expect its effect to be temporary. It won't protect the inoculated person forever."
511557, ""
511558, "My girl has grown up... I pray she survives this hell..."
511559, "Do you know where Burakh is hiding?"
511560, "Oh, I thought you two didn't really get along... Are you looking for him?"
511561, "Yes, I sorely need to find him."
511562, "Then you'll be most unhappy to learn that he's been seized on Saburov's orders. I was informed by Lara Ravel about it. A witness of Burakh's arrest came by to her place."
511563, "Seized? Why?"
511564, "A groundless suspicion. Many innocent people were arrested and thrown into the dungeons of the Town Hall last night. Barley and his barbers caused quite a stir yesterday-a stir that has made quite an... ahem... impression on Saburov. And so he resorted to harsh punitive measures. Everything goes exactly as expected; this is his first step towards autocracy."
511565, "What is Burakh being accused of?"
511566, "I don't know, but I have absolutely no doubt it's a false accusation! Artemy has been accused of every possible villainy lately. They call him the Ripper. They cry bloody murder while he works his fingers to the bone trying to save us all. But no one cares about it at all!"
511567, "I'll demand that Saburov let him go."
511568, "Give it a try, dear doctor. Artemy deserves it. Even if he has taken it upon himself to break a law or two, we need him alive. Perhaps if you vouched for him, the fierce Saburov would let him go... Oh what a grave mistake it was to grant him full authority! Your mistake, doctor..."
511569, "I'll do my best."
511570, "I need to get inside the Termitary."
511571, "What for? I can verbally describe everything you can possible see there. Just think of a ward full of demented people, multiply it a hundredfold, add the Sand Plague-and there you go... that's the... Termitary."
511572, "I'm bound by duty."
511573, "No, doctor, even if the Sand Plague is merciful to you, the inhabitants of the Termitary will not extend similar kindness. You are our last hope, the only doctor that hasn't succumbed to despair and is still fighting. Risking your life would be the last thing I would do-even if that meant becoming the next victim of Saburov's abuse."
511574, "I'm not the last to keep on fighting."
511575, "All the rest are doomed. Rubin? I can imagine the fate he has chosen. I know whose precious blood he is draining for his vaccine. Rubin will pay his price, fully and very soon. It doesn't take a prophet to see that."
511576, "Artemy Burakh is still fighting."
511577, "I'm afraid young Burakh doesn't have much time left. He has been labelled an outlaw. It seems that everyone but I thinks him to be a monster. And he will never be left at peace after what happened today."
511578, "It's not like I can avoid risking my life anyway."
511579, "The Termitary is a graveyard of its own. An educated risk is one thing; lying down into a grave and giving an order to start filling it up is different. Although the latter seems to be the safer option... than delving into the Termitary."
511580, "I will get there sooner or later anyway."
511581, "Better later than sooner then, for every spare hour will add to your chances."
511582, "One day you'll be forced to."
511583, "No one will force me to unlock the Termitary. Definitely not Saburov, that's for sure. Even if he tries, I would rather accept the blow. No, doctor, the doors of the Termitary shall not be open to you for as long as I'm in control. Just accept the fact, dear doctor."
511584, "You've got a ready tongue..."
511585, "I want to get a girl out of there. The little daughter of the deceased commandant of the Termitary."
511586, "Clara is still out there fighting. The psychic girl."
511587, "Oh yeah, Clara... The changeling... I don't like her. My daughter doesn't like her either-and my daughter's opinion is more important for me than any tangible proof."
511588, "I'm sure she's already been inside the Termitary."
511589, "I am rather fond of your daughter myself."
511590, ""
511591, "We did really well last night!"
511592, "They say you've arrested Burakh. Is that true?"
511593, "Absolutely. That villain was seized as well. Like I said, the night was bountiful: the patrolmen killed more than fifty armed thugs. Fifty more were arrested. Soon they're going to be tried by our military court."
511594, "Was Burakh caught red-handed?"
511595, "If he were caught red-handed, he'd have been executed on the spot. Just like anyone else who was caught in the act. There's a whole lot of accusations against him though. Mark Karminsky will expose his crimes easily."
511596, "Let Burakh go, governor! He must help me with fulfilling my duties!"
511597, "Never. Burakh is accused of a dozen murders at least, including his father's, violation of sacred customs and desecration of the dead. He's the most dangerous criminal of all who have appeared in the town in these horrible days. I won't ever let him out even if you vouch for him."
511598, "Where do you keep him?"
511599, "So there were many arrests yesterday?"
511600, "There were. And you can already see the result. The number of crimes has halved since last night. At this rate, no one will be cut down tomorrow. There is too much death around, no need to multiply it by taking the few lives spared by the Sand Dirt."
511601, "What has Artemy done?"
511602, "Karminsky? The Inquisitor?"
511603, "Exactly. Don't you know the Powers That Be have sent him here? He's a virtuoso of finding evidence and solving the most complicated cases. I'm sure a two-hour chat with him can make the Ripper confess to everything."
511604, "Until Karminsky arrives, you'll have to let Burakh go."
511605, "You'll regret that, governor!"
511606, "Why do you ask?"
511607, "I need his expert advice."
511608, "I'm sorry, Bachelor, but you've managed to find out who murdered Simon, without examining witnesses or seeing the crime scene or even inspecting the body. Which makes me sure that you can do without that savage's advice this time as well. I wish you the best of luck."
511610, "Fine then. I'll find another way."
511611, "Sir, a lot of innocent people were falsely accused yesterday! I demand you set them free!"
511612, "Who told you they were innocent? They were arrested on suspicion of robberies, murders, and thefts."
511613, "Who made the charges?"
511614, "People I trust as much as myself. The patrolmen who selflessly serve to maintain order and keep townsfolk safe from violence caused by that out-of-control scum. "
511615, "Prove it then. There is this thing called the presumption of innocence. Is it no more one of the basics of criminal law?"
511616, "Not since a state of emergency was declared in the town. As you can see, I have executed no one. All of them are waiting for the Inquisitor's trial."
511617, "You've made people angry! It was hard enough for them to keep from violence when the situation prompted them to! Now they're furious since their virtuous restraint was penalized rather than appreciated!"
511618, "We can't take any chances. We have to catch every suspicious-looking person, in order to avoid further murders."
511619, "If you keep doing it the way you do it now, mark my words, you won't prevent further murders, you'll cause them."
511620, "I guess you feel obligated to be a humanist, Bachelor. Do you really think the arrests will provoke the people? Don't. We're past fearing popular unrest. The most terrible things have already happened. It can't get any worse."
511621, "You're wrong! The Inquisitor will make me responsible, not you."
511622, "I'm not a humanist. I don't care much about those people's sorrows. But what you've been doing here is suicidal. I'm telling you this because I care about what will happen in the streets tomorrow!"
511623, "Oh... that changes everything."
511624, "The infection has reached the jail, governor! The inmates are panicking. Set them free, or, I swear, you'll be the one to answer to the Inquisitor! I'll make sure of that."
511625, "I can answer for myself just fine, Bachelor. By the way, if you expect the Inquisitor to show more mercy, then you know nothing of Inquisitors. Especially not the one sent here by the Powers That Be."
511626, "I've found out who the prisoners are. They are not murderers."
511627, "I can tell you as well. They are criminals! The ones who destroyed the water supply. The ones who looted the blocked districts. Suspicious-looking armed scum who were caught near the Wastehouse!"
511628, "And who would that be?"
511629, "We aren't sure yet, but it's already clear that it will be either Orff or Karminsky. I can't tell which one is worse."
511630, "I'm ready to bail the innocent ones out. How much do you want for each one?"
511631, "I'm ready to bail the innocent ones out. How much do you want for each one?"
511632, "They're not in debtors' prison, Bachelor! They're accused of robberies and banditism, and should be put on trial. No bail. Better death sets them free than your money."
511633, "Damn you to hell!"
511634, "You're making a mistake."
511635, "Of course you did."

511641, "I'm beginning to feel that the wheel of my fortune... has finally touched me."
511642, "Please convince your spouse to set Artemy Burakh free. He was arrested on a false accusation."
511643, "This cannot be... I do not dare to interfere with my husband's decisions."
511644, "Don't you care about Burakh?"
511645, "Of course I do.... I dislike this man... If my intution doesn't fail me... he's bound to cause much grief to our town. And I know that my intuition is correct... My star has finally ascended. I've never sensed the threads of the future as clearly as I do these days."
511646, "Yet you've foretold my death-the death I have safely avoided."
511647, "...Have you now?"
511648, "I'm alive."
511649, "I don't know... It's very unclear... Sometimes people consider themselves alive when they're already corpses..."
511650, "I don't think I have to dispute the obvious."
511651, "Can you even imagine what it's like in the local jail right now?"
511652, "We don't have a jail..."
511653, "Where do you keep prisoners then?"
511654, "In the Town Hall's dungeons... I'm listening... to what goes on there... Fear... hatred... revenge... the desire to kill, to kill as many as possible... A concoction of emotions-and not a tiniest shred of thought... That's what I sense."
511655, "Is Burakh held there?"
511656, "Very unlikely... The whole Town Hall is chock-full of arrested bandits, though the building was never designed to become a jail... It was founded as a book depository... No, my spouse keeps the beast in its own lair. Or maybe by the lair... so forget your pointless pursuit..."
511657, "Why would he keep him 'by' the lair? It would be way easier to hold the beast under arrest at his own place."
511658, "Mmm... Perhaps it's because there was less noise across... the place-it was very quiet. He'd rather have the clanking of iron, so no one would hear the screams or shouting... No one would come to the rescue... How cold... I'm shivering..."
511659, "Pity."

511664, "You mean the Harpist. He's dead."
511665, "What were his words?"
511666, "That his only final wish was to eat a handful of large raspberries."
511667, "No... I meant about Burakh's arrest. Did he say anything about where he was taken?"
511668, "He saw them escort him, nothing more. It was by the Rail Bridge. He was seized by Saburov's patrolmen-there were three of them, and yet they barely managed to keep him under control. When they were crossing the embankment, Burakh broke loose, so they knocked him to the ground. The Harpist said he also thought back then that they wouldn't be able to take him anywhere far. And then he felt sick."
511669, "Why are the Saburovs doing that to him?"
511670, "I think he got into Clara's way somehow. This Clara girl seems pretty scary... I guess Artemy must have disrupted her plans-and I doubt she was planning to do good. As for Burakh, on the other hand, his noble intentions are apparent."
511671, "How is she scary?"
511672, "I can't tell if she's a healer or a killer... It's so confusing. But she's definitely unkind. Everything about her is just so suspicious... You know, sometimes I think it was she who made the Harpist die-the man who brought the news of Burakh's arrest."
511673, "So you hold him in hight regard?"
511674, "He... He turned out to be a very impressive person. The semblance to his father is so strong! I can't help thinking about him... Indeed. He is an honest and brave man. You two would have made good friends."
511675, "So Burakh's lair was at the Works?"
511676, "Somewhere in a suburbian area, in Earth. As far as I understood, the place aws industrial. I'd suspect the Termitary... but that's obviously impossible. Somewhere at the Works, perhaps? Try your luck there."
511677, "Are there living quarters at the Works?"
511678, "I don't know. I've never been there. Although... Isidor did have a hideout or a secret lab at the Works... I remember him complaining that he was too old to climb over the embankment ten times a day and that railroad noise could be rather distracting."
511679, "Do not mourn your loss, Lara. We all have to go some time."
511680, "Did he tell you where they took Burakh?"
511681, "Did he have business with Burakh?"
511682, "He got it into his head that he's supposed to help Burakh in any way he could. He only came by here to grab the bare essentials-and said Artemy was the only person worth giving one's life for. But in the end his body just gave in..."
511683, "What about you? Do you like Burakh?"
511684, "Is that why they haven't taken Burakh to the Town Hall dungeons?"
511685, "I don't know... The Town Hall is chock-full of prisoners... dozens of people were arrested yesterday on various allegations, you know. Saburov probably wants to keep Burakh as far from the light of day-and anyone's eyes-as possible."
511686, "Why?"
511687, "I suspect it was Katerina's whisper in his ear that became his inspiraton... they're playing a dark game."
511688, "What's it all about?"
511689, ""
511690, "No trespassing."
511691, "I'm not a trespasser-just a passer-by. What about you? Are you, by any chance, the infamous dangerous offender?"
511692, "What's in it for you?"
511693, "I command you to set him free."
511694, "I'm here to convoy Burakh to the governor's office."
511695, "An order came through to transport the prisoner to the Town Hall."
511696, "If this were the case, people of lower rank... and heavier build would have come. We know who you are, doctor. You are kindly joking, aren't you?"
511697, "I'm not. Bring the prisoner here."
511698, "I was strictly ordered by governor Saburov to guard the prisoner with my life. There was a special order too: if the prisoner dies of the Sand Pest, we ain't supposed to bury him or give the body to the undertakers. We're to inform the governor in person and await further instructions."
511699, "Don't you think that's a bit too strict?"
511700, "Strict my ass! We put almost seventy people behind bars yesterday, on suspicion, of course. Killed loads of folks too. Must've been thugs and cutthroats, the ones we've killed. I've heard their thug friends are all up in arms, planning to take revenge on us... But they're out of men-and out of luck."
511701, "Is that so? I think you'd better stay alert, kind sir. The underground world has its ways of keeping its real power disguised."
511702, "I hope the inquisitor gives the arrested thugs what they deserve."
511703, ""
511704, "Many a one says ill that sleeps well."
511705, "Grief, how would you like to kill a few patrolmen? You won't be held accountable for this sin."
511706, "Who's to guarantee me that? You?"
511707, "Me."
511708, "They've caught Artemy Burakh. "
511709, "Eh... So what? I mean I'd like to, I would, Doc... Like I'd ever pass on the chance. But, eh... the honey's sweet, but the bees sting. Them patrollin' bees are much worse than them worker bees, y'know, they hit hard and without a shred of pity, organized too. They'll show us no mercy, they won't. Their orders are, we deserve no mercy. We deserve bein' strangled, exterminated, 'n buried alive."
511710, "I need your help. Set Burakh free. I'll cover you."
511711, "This is the dear kind of help, dear Doc. It won't come cheap."
511712, "Name your price then. Like I could ever expect anything else from you!"
511713, "Avenge your dead, Grief. It's a good opportunity. Bring the patrolmen down. They'll get what they deserve."
511714, "Why would I, Doc? They ain't no fuzz, y'know, they used to be our lot. They're doin' their job just fine-'tis their duty to hold the pest back, it is..."
511715, "Indeed. But the exact persons I'm talking about have abandoned the community service for the favours from the higher-ups."
511716, "Bring us ten grand-I'll bail out my hawks, arrested on filthy slander and false accusations, myself. Their only option's a noose anyway, it is, so we'll bail 'em out 'n send 'em to extinguish them enemies of yours. Doin' some good for our good Doc!"
511717, "Fine, I'll set them free myself."
511718, "No, dontcha even think about it. Like they'd ever care which of 'em jail meat is our lot and which are just random folks! You'll bail out the wrong ones... 'N then what? Eh? Now for the love of what's holy, dontcha go to Saburov with that... I know my way 'round them corpsebringer guards, all right? Ten grand, Doc. That's all that's required from you. And no bargainin', 'tis not a good time to bargain. I've said my word 'n shown you my price tag."
511719, "I'll think about that."
511720, "Anna, the precious lil' singin' bird of ours, has been so lively 'n so kickin' lately! Now she wants to bail my villain folks out of jail-and the bail's supposed to be real fat, it is, so she must know where to get a lotta monies. Ten lives are worth at least some coins, eh? Even them villain lives. The lovely beaut must be in a serious need of a hit on someone, I figure."
511721, "What villains are you talking about?"
511722, "Our good lads are doin' the languishin' in the Town Hall. They got the wrong people yesterday, they did... missed the point completely. And Anna, the dove of love that she is, is all up and ready to pay real gold for 'em captive villains-only to have 'em do her biddin'. And the dove of love is right, she is! We'll dance to the tune of the lad-or lass-who shells out the coin. That is what gratitude means."
511723, "Let them just serve the time there for a while, what's the rush?"
511724, "So rumour has it there's an inquisitor up 'n comin' straight towards our lil' town, eh? Well, I don't have the guts to stand up to an inquisitor-and I definitely won't have any after he's done with us lot. Neither will my lads. We'd rather die of an honest bullet straight between our eyes than expire on a torture rack after a week. Whaddyathink?"
511725, "I think that there's always punishment after a crime."
511726, "How about I bail your villains out?"
511727, "You'd have our most eternal gratitude, Doc, kind services on our part included. We'd rather do your biddin' than die tryin'... to execute the stupid wench's revenge."
511728, "How many thieves do I need to bail out?"
511729, "Ten thousand, Doc. I'm doin' you a favour here, 'tis just half the sum-I'll pay the rest from my own pocket. Human life comes kinda cheap these days, dontcha agree?"
511730, "I'll get back at you when I have the sum."
511731, "That's too much."
511732, "No bargainin'. 'Twasn't me who set the price, 'twon't be me who lowers it. If you're in, come with your hands full, otherwise it's bon voyage to you."
511733, "Fine, have it your way."
511734, "I've collected ten thousand. Here you go."
511735, "Wait for my villains. The attack begins just like that, no warnin'. Be prepared, 'twould be a pity for you to miss out."
511736, "I'll be ready. Don't touch Burakh. Do you know what he looks like?"
511737, "We know everythin', Doc, we do. Little birds tell us every single thing. Now shush, go to the ambush, and wait for us."
511738, "Fine."
511739, "That's for sure."
511740, ""
511741, "Tonight the patrols were grabbing anyone who looked even remotely suspicious; two dozen people were arrested just for having a knife or other weapon in their possession. Many were taken for not giving out Yaklakh's accomplices. Others-for looting the dead or their homes."
511742, "How many people have been arrested?"
511743, "What will happen to these people?"
511744, "I don't know for sure, but since the Town Hall's cellar is stuffed to the brim, I'll hazard a guess and estimate the number to be around a hundred. The cells are so crowded that there's no room to lie down."
511745, "Almost all of them are innocent; there's no direct evidence that prove otherwise. They're awaiting the judgement of an inquisitor, who's bound to arrive here very soon-tomorrow night, I think, or early on the next day. But since it's going to be either Orff or Karminsky, I wouldn't expect much lenience."
511746, "How do you know this?"
511747, "Why are you so sure of their innocence?"
511748, "There are Executors guarding them. Distributing water among the prisoners and the like."
511749, "What do you personally make of all this?"
511750, "Because the patrolmen would have killed anyone proven guilty-however tenuous the accusation-during the arrest. If they didn't feel in the right ending those people's lives, then the arrested are innocent. Perhaps a few of them might just happen to be robbers, but that's pure coincidence..."
511751, "This is a disgrace! Rest assured that I will speak with Saburov about that."
511752, "The situation is tough, and it requires definitive measures. The patrolguard did the right thing."
511753, "I want to bribe the Executor guards and free some of those people. Would you be willing to help me?"
511754, "With pleasure. An unexpected gesture from you, though. What's your motive?"
511756, "Duty. I don't readily sympathize with people regardless of which side of the bars they're on, but I feel responsible for any acts committed by those with power. It is my duty to undo and compensate at least a fraction of the damage inflicted by the law enforcers' incompetence."
511761, "I doubt Saburov will approve of your actions when he finds out."
511762, "Very well. I'll collect as much money as I can."
511764, ""
511765, "The devil take a governor like that... Although I'm not sure what I would have done in his place. His position is far from enviable."
511766, "That can be said about every one of us. "
511767, "Will you help me free the innocent from jail?"
511769, "I'll present Saburov with an ultimatum. Soon he will see for himself how pointless and pernicious his idea has turned out to be. He thinks he can terrorize the people, but all he'll accomplish is to turn the people into a gang of armed thugs. By tomorrow I'll have pressed this matter and freed the innocent."
511770, "They may not survive until tomorrow morning."
511771, "What are you talking about?"
511772, "There was an infected person in one of the cells. The fever had already spread in there. The Executors can't even separate the sick from the healthy-so tightly is the jail crammed."
511773, "What are you suggesting?"
511774, "The Executors guarding the prisoners happily take bribes when the governor isn't looking. They want ten thousand per person."
511775, "We have barely any money left. Fifty five thousand-that's all we have left right now... Try intimidating the Executors; namedrop the Kains! Tell them we know all about their schemes. That they themselves will end up behind bars unless they let these people out of jail! "
511776, "They are masked. No one has seen an Executor's face."
511777, "I don't think they're going to listen. These masked people are suicide volunteers. They are not of this world. They fear nothing."
511778, "Fine... Take twenty five thousand. At least bail out someone, several people. And I think I will still draft that ultimatum to Saburov. If we survive the epidemic, he and us, I swear we'll remind him of all this!  "
511779, "I thank you."
511780, "I myself intend to frighten him with the prospect of the Inquisitor's wrath. He will have to account for his actions to superior authorities one way or the other."
511781, "Several dozen innocent people have been thrown in jail. An even greater number have simply been killed in the streets. But those, at least, were robbers and looters... These poor other people got locked up just because patrolmen didn't like their faces! "
511782, "Who is in jail?"
511783, "First there were mass arrests because of yesterday's act of sabotage. They took everyone who had taken part in breaking the water supply-even those who they thought could benefit from the act in some way. That is how several selfless volunteers ended up in jail for distributing water..."
511784, "As if the rest wasn't enough."
511785, "You'll be even less pleased to find out those people were arrested on your authority. It was claimed you were the one who had discovered the roots of this conspiracy, and that those roots turned out to be quite sprawling... "
511786, "This is absurd..."
511787, "And finally, they arrested poor souls caught searching dead bodies-and the buildings already gutted by marauders. Including brothers taking lockets from their dead sisters, and homeowners returning to the ashes of their homes..."
511788, "I've heard enough. Saburov will pay for this dearly."
511789, "I'm sure patrolmen abusing their power are to blame. Saburov most certainly knows nothing about this. I will talk to him and restore justice."
511790, ""
511791, "I guess I'm going to see my brother soon enough."
511792, "I'm sorry I couldn't set all the prisoners free."
511793, "Ah, that's what is troubling you... Frankly, I think you shouldn't have interfered, no matter how merciful and compassionate your actions were. These victims of false justice are now besotted by what has happened to them. Not to mention those affected by the echo of the persecution-all these exaggerated, distorted rumours of the governor's abuse of power..."
511794, "Is there some double meaning to this?"
511795, "You think riots are coming?"
511796, "I'm positive that a law-abiding citizen who was falsely accused of robbery will soon reach for the knife. There's nothing left for him to fear... The townsfolk spend their every waking hour in waiting for a seed of painful death to sprout within them. Do you think these people will be scared of the truncheons carried by the town guard?"
511797, "I don't think they've lost respect for any kind of authority."
511798, "There is no authority today, apart from that installed by the rule of Fear-and this tyrant will empower the townsfolk to take up arms and use them without prejudice or hesitation. And they will do just that, I assure you. Yesterday's arrests went a long way to advance this hazardous instability, even though it would have set in time regardless."
511799, "I suspect that's your grief talking."
511800, "Perhaps. The people whom my brother loved and took great care of are no longer human. The Sand Dirt rots them alive; it turns them into abominations in the face of human nature. Every passing moment more murderers, more robbers and looters are created by hunger and fear. There is no salvation from this pestilence... "

511803, "Feeding my starving children by having pulled a knife on someone has been an enticing option all along-and all too long I held back! Well, not anymore I won't. Paying for your honesty by being locked up in a prison cell together with the Sand Plague-or becoming a marauder? I'd rather prefer the latter!"
511804, "You'd rather not. Marauders to a town are like bacilli to a body-and deserve the same treatment."
511805, "They're already arresting innocent people, so we don't have a choice! We'll gang up to make patrolhounds think twice before even approaching us. And to hell with anyone who gets in our way!"
511806, "Watch out, kind sir. The law is the law-even now."
511807, "There is always a bigger power."
511808, "This line of thinking does you little honour, however angry you are."

511892, "Why?"
511893, "He will suspect... If I approach him, he'll think that I'm after a certain child-a child he actually owes me... It's like a debt that is yet to be paid off... Hard to explain, really... Look, it's our business, okay? The Caravan used to have its own code of conduct-and according to this code, I have no right to ask anything from the man."
511894, "Or else he'd demand your rights to the child back, wouldn't he?"

She's not his biological daughter though; he kidnapped her from a family of poor weavers eight years ago, planning to fashion her into a dancer, but at the eleventh hour he changed his mind and adopted her. And now he adores her! So, she's disappeared, huh?"
511902, "So she's a dancer?"
511903, "Yes. Try your luck asking around in the pub. She used to have a side job there-nightly, keeping it secret from her foster father. The new outbreak may have caught her right there; perhaps she was unable to get home before dawn like she usually does..."
511904, "You told me he's filthy rich. Why didn't he give her pocket money?"
511905, "She did this for pleasure, you see. She enjoyed dancing naked and drinking the thick twyrine which flows like water there. I doubt the Hunchback would allow her all this."
511906, "Well then, I'll ask around in the pub."
511907, "The Hunchback has given me money in advance, but I couldn't save the girl. She has caught the infection accidentally... and then the Ripper's knife got her. The only consolation is that she didn't really have a chance to make it; the Ripper wouldn't have cut her otherwise."
511908, "Does that mean Willow's dead? Are you sure?"

511922, "No resemblance to you then?"
511923, "You find it funny to mock a grieving old hunchback, kind sir...? No. Not even a slightest shred of resemblance, not in the appearance. She... she took after her late mother."

511925, "I dunno! Everywhere! She might be in an infected district-or maybe not... Oh, what if she was murdered... slaughtered... seized by them patrolmorons and thrown into jail? I've been to the Town Hall though... No sign of my little girl..."
511926, "All right. I'll try... Though I must tell I don't feel like I'm likely to succeed."
511927, "Here. Have some money. In advance. I've got more where it came from. This is criminal money, illicit money, earned through baddoing; it's time it served a good purpose. Those thugs, those robbers...! I've always hated them! Even Nina couldn't take my daughter away from me... How can this be happening now? Huh? After all those years of having her here?"
511928, "Wait for me here."
511929, "Where is she likely to have gone to?"
511930, "Oh, I don't need that to make you shell out the money. How would you like to have your Caravan past known to the public?"
511931, "The Caravan... Why? Why wouldja do that?"
511932, "To make you pay. Did you say a hundred and fifty thousand?"
511933, "You evil toerag! D'ya think this is the time to have a laugh at my expense? D'ya think I'm all worked up 'bout keeping my precious sweet life? I'll rip your throat out with my teeth, you little dweeb!"
511934, "Cut it..."
511935, "Well?"
511936, "I've found your Willow all right. I'll bring her here after nine o'clock."
511937, "I've come bearing grave news. Brace yourself."
511938, "Where is she? I gotta go after her!"
511939, "She's sick?"
511940, "I can't tell you that. I've given my word to the owners of the establishment she's hiding at."
511941, "What es-table-shment? What owners? What are they afraid of?"
511942, "You, I presume. And I can't blame them."
511943, "Why didn't she come with you right now?"
511944, "She's conscious that she might get infected on her way here. They victims of the infection are everywhere, ready to jump passers-by, begging for help."
511945, "Scum! Burn them, burn them, burn them to ashes to keep them away from fresh flesh! Fine. Bring her back as soon as you can. The second half of the reward will be waiting for you."
511946, "What about the first one?"
511947, "She's dead."
511948, "What?! How? Did she get infected?"
511949, "Probably."
511950, "......It's not your fault. But... someone's fault it is! Eh? Someone's been touchng her, holding my lovely thing with their pestilent pesty hands. Kissing her with their hollow black mouth, a pit of a mouth! Things are going south! Oh, no pity for the pitty-mouths, I'll avenge the sweet thing. We'll find the person that's done this to her, we'll find them all them pitty-mouths. I shall found a brotherhood of zealots and we shall burn them all to ashes. Oh, it'll be fun, big great fun..."
511951, "The streets are filled with zealots even without your help."
511952, "Here it is. A deal's a deal."
511953, "All right, give it to me."
511954, "I know... They're killing normal healthy people. We're gonna burn the pest. I'm praying to have a chance to burn the pitty-mouth, the person that had touched her tender knees last... I pray I get the chance to burn that person alive before the Sand Plague burns them from the inside! The Plague that's snatched my girl away from me... I'll burn it burn it burn it. Burn it to ashes! Burn it to the ground!"
511955, "This is the most idiotic way to fight the epidemic I can think of."
511956, "Big Vlad provided patronage to Isidor Burakh's son, that foolhardy surgeon. He has to know where to find the man."
511957, "Burakh has been arrested by Saburov. But the governor will have to lend the man to me for a day..."
511958, "Perhaps I should check on Katerina... to make sure she's in good health, if nothing else."
511959, "A patron of the House of the Living has seen Saburov's people seize Burakh. They can tell me more."
511960, "We are-and we'll keep on going. Don’t be sad."
511961, "Haruspex"
511962, "LIVING HEART. The heart of a person infected with the Sand Plague."
511963, "CELL KEY. This key was taken from one of the patrolmen guarding the imprisoned Ripper."
511964, "Do you think so? And have you met Clara yet, Bachelor?"
511965, "Who is that?"
511966, "Clara really does possess unusual abilities. It's true that she can inspire love and trust at first sight. It is also true that her touch is imbued with... a remarkable energy. A healing power. However, the nature of that power remains a mystery to me."
511967, "You sound as if you knew all that firsthand."
511968, "I have long been paying special attention to that girl. But, I repeat, I still know nothing about her despite having talked to her throughout the last few days. And I cannot explain the facts that I have witnessed. It would be interesting to hear your opinion... "
511969, "It's curious. Somehow I knew you would want me to run into her at some point."
511970, "I just wanted to find out how well you know her. "
511971, "I hope I've satisfied your curiosity. "
511972, "I don't know her at all. "
511973, "I've heard some rumours. And I know by now what local gossip is worth. Not to be ignored, but not to be taken literally either if one cares about one's sanity."
511974, "Why did you mention Clara at all?"
511975, "What's your own opinion of her?"
511976, "Yes. Just had the pleasure. Isn't the girl a bit of a megalomaniac?"
511977, "I've heard her described as a zealous person with a mesmerizing voice and hands that can heal any affliction. So it's true?"
511978, "Your wife says the strangest things..."
511979, "This is the end... This is what the Inquisitor is going to see tomorrow!"
511980, "Is Clara with you? "
511981, "No, Bachelor. Clara is not with us. Too much evidence says that she is not who she pretended to be. It is possible that she is indeed Simon's murderer and spawn of the Earth. We decided to banish her from our home and withdraw our protection from her."
511982, "They told me she was like a daughter to you..."
511983, "Everything has changed. We have no daughter now. She is a murderer, a liar, and a thief. Everyone has renounced her. That silly halfwit Grace is the last person who still associates with her. "
511984, "Where can I find her? "
511985, "Her place is at the Bone Stake. I hope that soon enough everyone who seeks her will be able to find her there."
511986, "I see."
511987, ""
511988, "Why are you giving me that look?"
511989, "Is Var the Hunchback your father?"
511990, "Did he send you?"
511991, "Yes. He's worried about you. Come with me. The streets are unsafe, but I'll make sure that you get home in one piece."
511992, "But I don't want to go! I'd rather stay here. My stepfather is a burdensome custodian-and I've had enough of it."
511993, "Don't you love him?"
511994, "That's a very complicated question. When I was a child, he kidnapped me from my real father, and when my father came to rescue me from the Caravan, Var killed him. He did it because he loved me. I only found out about it yesterday. So what am I supposed to feel?"
511995, "All right. I'll just let him know of your whereabouts then."
511996, "No, please! Don't do that. He has no idea where I spend my nights! If he ever gets even the slightest hint of suspicion of how I choose to spend my leisure time, he'll tear both the owners and the patrons of this lovely establishment to pieces... But that's all right, I will speak to him. Personally. I'll tell him I've had enough."
511997, "What do you mean, you've had enough?"
511998, "These are the last days of my life, and I intend to spend them like I want to. That is to say, here. But I'll be the person to tell him that; I'll be waiting for you at nine o'clock in the Blind Backyard. We'll go see him together. Will you stand up for me if he resorts to physical violence?"
511999, "I will."
512000, "All right. The Blind Backyard, nine o'clock."
512001, "Why not go right now?"
512002, "There is still something I have to do here. We'll meet at nine o'clock, when it's dark. I'd ask you to pick me up, but that would be impossible. I can't be seen picked up by a man."
512003, "Just be careful."
512004, "No. I want to get you out of here myself."
512005, "So he's not your father?"
512006, "Come with me."
512009, "Yes, what is it? "
512010, "I wanted to ask you about Rubin. What do you intend to do with him?"
512011, "No, nothing. "
512012, "Say what you will, doctor, but I'll adress the matter as I see fit. Rubin is going to give himself up to me of his own free will. Say your farewells. From now on you are the only one able to save us."
512013, "Have mercy for him."
512014, "I'm looking for the carrier, Judge. The one who most likely was, after all, Simon's murderer."
512015, "Cruel irony! Why on the exact day I found out that my brother wasn't murdered and my awful suspicion is proven true-you acknowledge the existence of a killer! No, doctor. I thank you, but... I have no more desire to hunt murderers."
512016, "But I do! If we give over the murderous carrier to the Inquisitor, he will be appeased. This will grant us respite from further oppression."
512017, "I doubt that. You don't seem to understand the nature of the inquisitors too well, my dear doctor Dankovsky. Trust me, they will send Karminsky or Orff here, and both are well known for their remarkable ruthlessness. They will happily exterminate the carrier... but one execution won't suffice to appease them."
512018, "What happens now?"
512019, ""
512020, "And so... my life has come to an end."
512021, "What do you mean?"
512022, "Nothing, apart from what I'm saying. Any crime warrants punishment. And what I did was a crime, regardless of what good intentions I may have had. Here, take the vaccine. I'm going to see Georgiy."
512023, "That's suicide."
512024, "I did what had to be done, but I won't spend the rest of my days trying not to look the Kains in the eye. Come on, take it-I want you to have my treasures. I won't need them anymore."
512025, "All right, give me the vaccine-and go. I'll make sure to put in a good word for you."
512027, "Do you know what happened in the Cathedral? "
512030, "Yes. Saburov insists it could have been either Lara or Yulia. I'm sure both are innocent though; either Anna Angel or a criminal harbourer called Aspity must be the culprit. Am I correct in assuming you must be familiar with both of those ladies?"
512031, "That doesn't feel right."
512032, "Well, you've got your ultimate proof-a specimen of infected blood. Go ahead and compare it against their samples."
512033, "What are your grounds to suspect them?"
512034, "They are outsiders. They wish us ill."
512035, "I'll check their blood up, but this is nonsense."
512036, "So yesterday you managed to capture this disease? Or so I've heard, anyway. The town is abuzz with horrifying rumours of people being dissected alive... obviously, I don't believe those. The more dangerous kind of rumours are, it turns out, those about you acquiring a sample of infected blood..."
512037, "How so?"
512038, "An Inquisitor arrives tomorrow. It seems to me that someone wants to dispose of several young women before his coming. Presently the sword of justice hangs suspended above Yulia and Lara. They have been arrested, on Saburov's authority. But Vlad Olgimsky hasn't been idle either. If the girls survive until tomorrow, the Inquisitor will establish the truth, but... someone is eager to get ahead of him."
512039, ""
512040, "I've found the carrier! Tracked the carrier down! Go, go there at once-or you'll miss everything!"
512041, "Who is it? "
512042, "I told you to stay in!"
512043, "Ohh... There was a fight in the Ring-the one at the edge of the Crude Sprawl. I just couldn't keep myself from having a peep... Five men were fighting there against two butchers. There was bread at stake. The butchers won and started tearing them losers apart. And then, bam, one of them falls down clutching his belly, and then another! "
512044, "The shabnak! The lucid-skinned ghost, I told you before! This is it, I'm sure this it is. It's kind of bodiless-and it killed a man just by looking at him. We have to catch it! "
512045, "Where did it go? "
512046, "It's somewhere near the Abattoir! I was going to run looking for you at once, but luckily I stumbled upon a courier. Right now it's probably heading east, towards the Rotten Field! "
512047, "Killed a man by looking at him? How did that happen? "
512048, "What does the carrier have to do with this?"
512049, "The pale shabnak, glowing like a ghost, was hiding by the Abattoir, staring right at them butchers. It just... radiated hatred, you know! Its mug was all twisted with spite... Then it started digging around. That was it, for sure! And it's still hiding close about! Go catch it or it'll get away! "
512050, "And how am I supposed to catch it? "
512051, "All right, I'll go have a look at your ghost... "
512052, "So, have you caught the carrier?"
512053, "Do you know where Clara is? "
512054, "But that's exactly who I'm talking about! Except she turned out to not be Clara at all. Clara's a saint, and that shabnak's just a twin of hers! So you didn't catch her... I think this is your turn-tail moment. You have to run. She's looking for you. "
512055, "Why would I run from her? It's she who seems to be running from me."
512056, "No! She's looking for you-she told that to Grace and Murky. I'll find him, she said, and there'll be no mercy... That's the exact words, 'no mercy.' She can kill you with a single stare. You look into her eyes-and an hour later you're sick. Like, bam-and there you go."
512057, "Rubbish. Where can I find Clara? "
512058, "It's not a good idea, I'm telling you... All right. If you want to see her that bad, just wait a bit-and she'll find you herself."
512059, "My place of residence is an open secret. I'm not hiding from anyone."
512060, "No, I haven't."
512061, "Who told you all this nonsense? Huh? "
512062, "It's common knowledge that demons kill by gaze and touch-and so does Clara. You ask anyone, there's been a ton of witnesses. She's killed a whole bunch of people since morning. "
512063, "I've heard precisely the opposite: that she has a healing touch. How would you explain that paradox?"
512064, "You got me there... But none of the people I've asked has ever seen her heal others. They've seen her kill though."
512065, "Where can I find her?"
512066, "So what do you think, is that shabnak still hiding near the Abattoir? I should go have a look..."
512067, "That's just your imagination, Sticky. Stay home. "
512068, "Umm, I doubt that... but can't hurt to just go and check."
512069, "I'll go check then."
512070, ""
512071, "What do you want? "
512072, "Who are you? "
512073, "I was just searching for a body. I'm hungry... I'm tired. You don't need to hunt me. "
512074, "Are you really who they say you are? A Steppe creature?"
512075, "Are you dead? Are you a ghost? "
512076, "Did you start it all?"
512077, "Yes... "
512078, "You're going with me. "
512079, "Where is the girl? Why didn't she come to take me to the other side? "
512080, "I'll take you there myself-right now! "
512081, "Do not hunt me. Feel the skin of your face; you're dying already. Go away. I want to see the little one. Where is the kind girl?"
512082, "What's your name? "
512083, "Stop! "

512085, "..."
512086, "Tomorrow, everything will change."
512087, "Is something bothering you?"
512088, "I feel a powerful surge of lifeforce. How strange! I expected to be overcome with it on the first day-when Simon died. But it's only happening now... Time to begin! "
512089, "What are you talking about? "
512090, "Nothing of importance... I love seeing how unexpectedly, peculiarly, and precisely every omen, prediction, and foretelling comes true. It's time for me to begin fulfilling my duty. Seems like my time has come, Bachelor Dankovsky!"
512091, "What are you going to do? "
512092, "Oh, I don't know yet... It'll become apparent soon. For now I want to stay alone. I'll be sleeping. I want to dream about mother and Simon. I want to ask them questions."
512093, "Sleep. "
512094, "Yes. Everything will change tomorrow."
512095, "The firestarters are planning to attack the Termitary! Did you know that?"
512096, "Why?"
512097, "They want to burn out the infection-they believe that is where it's crawling from. You can hear most horrible rumours about the Termitary these days. And my father doesn't even want to move a finger! "
512098, "He could probably take advantage of the arson if someone was to set the Termitary afire."
512099, "Do not say so! Oh, I really, really want to believe that... that Father has nothing to do with this terrible plan."
512100, "How did you find out about it? "
512101, "My brother somehow did. He seems to care-truly. He is dying to stop them personally-but he doesn't yet know how. I only hope there will be no dying..."
512102, "I'll talk to him. "
512103, ""
512104, "The exterminators are planning to storm the Termitary. Stop them!"
512105, "How?"
512106, "What exterminators?"
512107, "The arsonists who have been terrorizing the town. Mad fanatics gathered by Var the usurer. He's a former fire eater or firefighter or something; it didn't take him long to gather a bunch of similarly insane maniacs. He's sworn to burn the disease out with fire."
512108, "Well, you can't stop the assault itself. But the informers who reported that to my... to me, said that at ten o'clock Var the hunchback and a few others will be around there to scout out the area and look for a way to pry open the barricaded entrance."
512109, "Did you mean to say they reported to your father?"
512110, "No... to a partner of mine."
512111, "Somehow I still think you meant your father. The informers told him of the upcoming assault and he agreed to turn a blind eye on it. Is that correct?"
512112, "Yes. But it's no concern of yours."
512113, "To find out who killed the immortal Simon Kain? The dead man's own family may not want it more than I do! I have an abiding desire to punish the murderer, to eradicate them, no matter if they were acting on their own account or at the behest of the Powers That Be! Whoever they were, they picked the moment far too well..."
512114, "My gentle associate, my selfless advisor Isidor Burakh was the last person to see Simon Kain alive. If it wasn't for Burakh's guidance, I never would have come to this backwoods domain. All the more reason to start my pursuit with him."
512115, "Isidor Burakh was murdered. The local authorities have sealed off his house. Alexander Saburov, the head of the Saburov family, has taken control of all proceedings regarding law and order in the town. The Saburovs are one of the three families that govern the town and Alexander was the person to take immediate measures after the discovery of Isidor's body."
512116, "If this Yulia Lyuricheva is genuinely capable of rational thought, then she is more astute than the majority of her contemporaries in this town. There are those who would believe that if I am unable to pinpoint the murderer by nightfall, then I am destined to become the next victim. If my encounter with death is so inevitable, then I should prepare myself for it. As ludicrous as it may be, the thought sends a chill down my spine."
512117, "It is unlikely that Simon's murderer had broken into the thespian's house. Her gaze may be unkind but she isn't guilty of killing Simon either. If I am going to help her dispose of the body, I will have to come to a covert agreement with Grace, the cemetery caretaker, and hope that she is a child capable of keeping a secret."

512120, "*** She who gives shelter to runaway workmen will lead the butcher deep into the Steppe. May this be comforting enough for kind-hearted Eva."
512121, "*** I was unable to fulfil Eva's request."
512122, "*** I had to kill the butcher. Olgimsky's son, Vlad the Younger, will surely appreciate this turn of events."
512123, "*** Killing people serves no purpose. Even if it is requested by someone who belongs to a family in power."

512126, "What kind of games are the local children playing? Lara is worried about them. Or she is worried about the mysterious 'shmowders' they seem to have discovered. It would put her mind at ease if I could get my hands on it and wrest it away from them. I know where they keep it. I can see the stash from my window in the Stillwater; in a house by the staircase ruin."
512127, "The children had already looted the cache. Now the poison is out on the streets; dozens of packages of it. I've got a sample of the 'shmowder'. Lara would be happy to take a look at it."
512128, ""
512129, "*** The 'shmowder' turned out to be a lethal mixture of powerful medicants. Lara was smart to burn it, but I can't help feeling like I should have kept it. The children were adamant that these shmowders are absolutely essential in some cases."
512130, "*** I decided to keep the poisonous 'shmowder' for myself. I have a strange feeling that it might be useful soon enough."
512131, "I am following in Isidor's wake, certain that the trail of his footsteps will lead me to the Crucible. There is little doubt in my mind that Isidor was well acquainted with each and every family in power, but it was Olgimsky that held Isidor's leash; a relationship rooted in unbreakable familial loyalty. It is with the Olgimskys that I must make my next destination."
512132, "The ruling families should stand together in the face of a common threat. Saburov should be granted the full extent of governing authority, but the families are not yet convinced that the plague is spreading. This obstacle is not insurmountable, however. If only I knew what it was that scared Anna Angel so much..."
512133, "In addition to tales of 'the maneater', the streets are rife with rumours of strange places and suspicious houses. It occurs to me that the children-swarming in the gutters and listening in from the shadows as they do-must learn of these places firsthand. It may be worthwhile to speak with their confidant: Victoria Olgimskaya."
512134, "Victoria told me of the dubious endeavours of Sticky, a street urchin. Apparently, the little rascal was quite distressed by the yield of his own exploits. If I can get my hands on him, then maybe I can shake out the location of the 'Silent House'."
512135, "I have to enter the 'Silent House' if I am to confirm that the disease that killed Simon is spreading. Who other than Bachelor Dankovsky is qualified to make that kind of verification to the local authorities? Of course, I must be careful. Rubin told me that the local drugstores are running out of immune system medication."
512136, "What is this house? What is the nature of that filth, and of the inflammation that covered the poor woman's body? If the rulers require proof, then this is it. I will present Saburov with the key; a grisly memento that unlocks the secrets contained within this diseased place."
512137, "My hypothesis was true. However two-faced the Powers That Be may be, their information was correct. There is an outbreak of highly contagious disease in town. Georgiy Kain and Vlad Olgimsky are at the head of the ruling families. They will need to be notified before anything else, and then I can take up my duties."
512138, "*** For the time being, the power struggle between the ruling families has ceased. They have appointed Alexander Saburov as Governor and granted him full civil and judicial control over the town. As such, he has declared a state of emergency. They will quarantine the town-and now everyone is looking to me to suggest a further course of action."
512139, "I should flee the town while I still can. Andrey Stamatin, the architect from the Capital, is the man who can help me escape."
512140, "A man of class... It was a pleasure to meet someone of my own standing here, and it would be twice the pleasure if he would agree to join me and leave this place together. It is nothing short of remarkable that the creator of the Cold Hall turned out to be my former University peer. Nonetheless, I doubt he would ever go anywhere without his brother."
512141, "I will need to find a gun and enough ammunition to last me through such a long and perilous journey, if I am ever to escape this place. Rumour has it that goods of this kind-the illegal kind-can be procured from the ringleader of the local outlaws. His name is Bad Grief."
512142, "It is done. The only way out of town is to sneak through the quarantine. If we can make it to the railway station, we can escape. The meeting is set to happen at ten, an hour after dark."
512143, "*** Our attempt to flee the town has failed. Someone compromised our plan and the patrolmen had blockaded all possible routes out of town."
512144, "*** The escape was a failure."
512145, "Lara reads too much classic literature. She wants to create a shelter where her friends and intimates will be safe while the outbreak is seething through the town. Vlad the Younger, Maria Kaina, and Yulia Lyuricheva are willing to provide the wherewithal to buy all the necessary provisions, but it comes down to me to source them. I need to buy several loaves of bread (3), a few bundles of dried fish (3) and some legs of smoked meat (3)."
512147, "'Help yourself...' The prices have indeed soared beyond reason. Even so, I have to get the provisions to the shelter. It's a necessity, and any price is a small sacrifice."
512148, "*** The House of the Living will be established in Lara Ravel's mansion. From now on I will always be able to get room and board here."
512149, "*** Even though Lara's request was nothing more than a grocery list, I wasn't able to help her."
512150, "If I am to eradicate the enemy, I must study its habits and capture it. This will be no mean feat. As is customary, we will need to perform an autopsy on someone who has already succumbed to the Sand Plague in order to procure a specimen of infected tissue. First and foremost I need to secure Saburov's consent, lest any of the usual complications linked to working with dead bodies should arise."
512151, "If I can reach an agreement with the concealers then the runaway butchers might help provide dead bodies for my autopsies. I have heard rumour of a house here, somewhere in Earth, where the criminal workers of the Abattoir go into hiding."
512152, "They have no great regard for human life, it seems. Three lives were given in exchange for Olgimsky's promise to cease the persecution of the runaway tradesmen."
512153, "The Skinners district is contaminated. I hope that one of the three butchers that Aspity dispatched there is able to return with a suitable specimen. There is no time to procrastinate."
512154, "The body that the butcher had cut open was taken to the cemetery."
512155, "The dissected body is still at the cemetery. I need to get to it before the new detachment of patrolmen arrives."
512156, "*** The tissue extracted from the corpse did not contain the microbe; it perished together with the host. I have come to the conclusion that it may be possible to curb any spreading of the disease. Full isolation will be essential. Mere walls, perhaps, may offer some kind of protection. Glass walls in particular."
512157, "*** I wasn't able to examine the tissue."
512158, "The disappearance of Simon's body seemed to greatly trouble the Kains. Could it be that a powerful, burly man like Rubin fell victim to some mysterious body-snatcher? Maybe Victor would have some insight into where I should start my investigation."
512159, "Vlad the Younger may have some more information. I need to know the place where Rubin took the body, and the locations of any other such places. I also need to ascertain whether the son of Isidor Burakh-widely known as 'The Ripper'-has anything to do with it."
512160, "The young Olgimsky-being a respectful son, as he is-has a cunning way of concealing his failures. He has agreed to provide the information I need, but only if the Kains withdraw their demands from his family. Meanwhile, Victor insists that I investigate the Termitary as soon as possible."
512161, "In all likelihood, the runaway butchers are hiding the body they stole in the house pinpointed by Vlad."
512162, "The body has been found. Is it Simon?"
512163, "*** It is a bitter errand to be the bearer of bad news. Although the body has been discovered, it had been mutilated beyond all recognition. Georgiy would be thankful for any news at all, however dire it may be. Yet something does not feel right..."
512164, "*** I was unable to help Georgiy."
512165, "Сapella requests that I find the little boy who ran off to the infected district. She wants me to take the 'shmowder' from him. It is reasonable to assume that the child is to be found somewhere close to the Silent House."
512166, "Apparently, I have no other choice but to test the 'shmowder' myself."
512167, "*** The shmowders are extremely detrimental to one's health, but they do eradicate the infection. Is this a mere coincidence, or did the children compound a cure? We will never find out..."
512168, "*** I was unable to help Capella."
512169, "Defending the town is the primary concern. Olgimsky had plenty enough time to create several safety zones. Nonetheless, he thought it better to use Lara Ravel's mansion to isolate those who ventured into the infected areas of the town."
512170, "Lara told me that the town waterworks ceased to function last night. Perhaps Vlad the Younger will be able to shed some light on the situation. He seems to be the man in the know when it comes to the town water supply."
512171, "Some of the larger buildings draw their water from natural springs (the Theatre, the Cathedral). I should investigate the sanitary viability of these buildings as they may be my only available choice. If they meet the most basic requirements then I am empowered to use them for medical purposes."
512172, "*** The Cathedral and the Theatre will be used as an isolation ward and as a hospital, respectively. The beak-headed Executors have taken up their duties. The masks will take care of the distribution of medicine as well as any postal deliveries. Furthermore, they will supervise compliance with the quarantine and the isolation of infected townsfolk."
512173, "*** The volunteers were acting on my behalf. Until further notice, the buildings will be repurposed for necessity until the state of emergency subsides."
512174, "Vlad the Younger will inspect what is left of the medicine supply. He has delegated the testing to four women; Yulia, Anna, Lara and Eva. I wonder if he appreciates that one of them may decide to test the solution on herself?"
512175, "Hardly a surprise. What else could have possibly occurred to them? From here on, I will handle the matter myself. I should test the pills in a contaminated house chosen by the Executors."
512176, "*** These medicaments are to be taken in volumes that could hardly be considered safe for one's health. Further to this, their effect is only temporary. The protection granted by immune system stimulants is insubstantial at best, whereas the antibiotics can slow the development of the disease and may, in some cases, destroy the infection altogether."
512177, "*** I was unable to test the medicine. There is no choice but to go along with whatever conclusion the girls have reached."
512178, "The governor has failed to stop the spree of outlaws that rampage the town. However, Alexander is certain that Bad Grief, the head of the warehouse smugglers, is responsible for organising their movements."
512179, "Bad Grief insists that he is innocent. Even if there is not a grain of truth to it, we will be able to use the villains feud for our own ends. In the meantime, it wouldn't hurt to tell Saburov about Barley's secret hideout."
512180, "The confrontation was a failure; the patrolmen suffered a brutal defeat. However, they did succeed in slaying many of the barbers in the attempt. The underworld is awash with blood. If there was ever a perfect moment to storm Barley's lair and emerge victorious then this may well be it. Taking advantage of all this chaos may just give me the leg up I need. My little ace in the hole, so to speak."
512181, "We have laid waste to the den of Barley's outlaws and extinguished what remained of the barbers. Now it will be easy to deal with Alexander and Bad Grief."
512182, "*** It remains to be seen whether these measures will curb the escalation of robberies and killings. A punishment like this is bound to give pause to anyone considering murder as a means of making a living."
512183, "*** I failed to put a stop to the criminal outbreak. An impossible task for one man."

512267, "I don't understand."
512268, "Long story short, I am going to die. But what my death will accomplish is that the memory of my brother will persevere and protect the town forever. I will die so that anyone can come to the hall of mirrors and partake of his immortal spirit. Not quite unlike the communion they take when they visit the church."

Disregarding the opinions of theologians and philosophers, and ignoring serious studies on the subject, he worked out a doctrine of his own. Try to imagine our shock when it turned out to be true."
512282, "Tell me about it."
512283, "We don't understand it ourselves. This necrosophy was probably the only area in which Georgiy had surpassed his great brother. No one knows why, but his recipes for communicating with the dead did work. All this terminology-'Memory', 'the Focus'-is of his coinage."
512284, "Go on... What is he planning now?"
512285, "The Focus of The Crucible doesn't fit Simon. It's too small. Simon cannot live in there for long, and there is another circumstance... Well, it's no longer important. The Focus of The Crucible is like a house chapel. While what Simon needs is a cathedral."
512286, "I don't suppose you're talking about the town's Cathedral-or are you?"
512287, "Of course not. I'm talking about the Polyhedron. Georgiy intends to transfer his deceased brother's soul there. He will have to die himself in order to achieve that. Your imagination must already be painting horrific and mesmerizing images-of dead Georgiy walking towards the Polyhedron, hands outstretched, dragging his feet, driven by Simon's spirit..."
512288, "You've guessed my impression very well. "
512289, "Perhaps that's what it would look like in the higher spheres. In the world of ideas, if you will. I will, however, disappoint you. It will happen quietly and inconspicuously. No one will see a thing. Georgiy will be lying in his room throughout the process. Simon's Memory will be transferred to the Polyhedron with the power of his mind."
512290, "Of his imagination, you mean?"
512291, "I meant exactly as I said. I would even risk supposing that Georgiy will die from the collosal strain that this work will have put on him. From the concentration of will, intellect, and all his mental powers."

512293, "The Termitary demands a closer inspection. We need to find out whether there are secret entrances to the Bull Project-and I mean the heart itself, this neolitic slaughterhouse. I mean, there undoubtedly are; I just want to know where they are located."
512294, "Do you think the inhabitants of the Termitary know?"
512295, "I'd like to check this on my own... Hovewer, right now I'm rather preoccupied with the data you collected yesterday. The statistics, the observation data from those watcher scoundrels... I think I'm beginning to see a consistent patters. Which is to say, I'd rather have you do the dangeroud part of the job."

512300, "You would have made a brilliant general. Had fate seen it fit for your venerable father to have had it his way, we could have been fearfully expecting you right now-rather than this nutjob Block."
512301, "Nutjob Block?"
512302, "Oh, haven't you heard yet? I'm not the only boon that the Powers That Bee have decided to bestow upon you; there's another surprise in store. The Commander leading the troops that are to turn this place upside down-and, more importantly, inside out, to raze it with heavy artillery-is none other than the renowned Alexander Block himself."
512303, "No way... I thought he was at the frontline?"
512304, "He's not. As soon as the Powers That Be found out about the epidemic, he was transferred to the rear. Now, considering what happened to both you and me, it wouldn't be a stretch to see this place as a mass grave for the celebrities non grata, so to speak... Which gives me reason to suspect that Block has annoyed someone either."
512305, "Curious."
512306, "Makes it no easier for us, though. He harbours little love for his new... workplace. Unlike me, he lacks the imagination required to fall in love his future scaffold-and so he is going to be ruthless. But it's not the subject at hand. Would you be willing to help me out?"

512423, "Yes, I've heard these stories."
512424, "As you can plainly see, there's no water in my well. It's empty. No one dredged up handfuls of poison from it. You can inspect the earth from the pile. The topmost layer of it belonged to the deepest underground one. It's just earth. Nothing out of the ordinary."
512425, "Then what did you need it for?"
512426, "Show me."
512427, "The earth was dumped into a ravine that, for a long time, used to serve as the Guzzle's embankment. That was actually precisely when and how the enbankment was built."
512428, "Oh, all right. I lied to you. Obviously I'm not endeavouring to find oil here. The well is my first step towards a lifelong dream; an archaeological excavation. I'm interested in the ancient culture of the Steppe peoples. I'm studying strata. Layers."
512429, "By the way, where did the taboo come from? Why is digging wells forbidden?"
512430, "So what are you looking for?"
512432, "It's not exactly taboo... According to a local legend, it's simply pointless-you won't find any water. 'The blood of the earth is hidden from the people.' That's from one of the local myths. And it's true: we've dug about a hundred meters down and found no moisture. Fascinating, isn't it?"
512433, "Where do the springs come from then?"
512434, "Oh, it's another curious phenomenon; I can't claim to be a specialist in this, though. But the builders, the ones who erected the Termitary and the stone houses in Earth, maintained that the springs are somehow enclosed in layers of solid compacted clay with sand deposits, through which water is supplied as if through pipes."
512435, "But why the artificial wells then?"
512483, "Move along, doctor. The prisoners are not available for communication."
512484, "Shut up."
512485, "I'm in. Here you go."
512489, "I've changed my mind. I'll help you find your daughter."
512490, "Nothing new."
512491, "Here. Have some money. In advance. I've got more where it came from. Just bring my Willow back, bring her back!"
512492, "Wait for me here. "
512493, "Is there any way to stop the assault?"
512494, "Why won't your father handle this matter?"
512495, "Enough! I've told you already-whatever my father does, I refuse to call his decisions in question. He is troubled enough as it is. Particularly troubled by something that is actually supposed to be your job; the search for the carrier. If the impending assault stirs your imagination so much, go ahead and talk to my father in person."
512496, "So what is it that you want from me? "
512497, "They're going to gather at the Termitary's entrance after dark. When the hunchback approaches the hallway, he needs to be shot. I think it would be best to lie in wait right there. All this time I've been looking for someone brave enough to do this for a sizable reward..."
512498, "A reward from your father?"
512499, "...No. From me personally. Ten thousand. "
512500, "All right. I'll talk to your father. "
512501, "Look somewhere else. "
512502, "Bachelor? "
512503, "Do you know the arsonists are planning to attack the Termitary? "
512504, "Let them plan. I hope they'll do without me wishing them good luck."
512505, "Don’t you want to stop them? "
512506, "Even if they had catapults, they wouldn't be able to damage these walls. The Termitary can withstand straight-line artillery bombardment. "
512507, "What if they get inside? "
512508, "Then they'll regret it bitterly. For goodness sake... Why don't you get back to looking for the carrier, doctor? If we figure out who the bitch is, tomorrow you will leave the town a winner, and the inquisitor will take the townsfolk's lives into his skilled hands. Including the lives of the Termitary's inhabitants."
512509, "What you're saying is you're planning to do exactly nothing, am I correct?"
512510, "I won't move a finger. And what could I possbily undertake? All my servants, mercenaries, and household members who still have the courage and the strength to meddle with this sort of affairs... well. Some of them are dead, others have joined the bandits."
512511, "Bandits? This is new. "
512512, "My household is not the only source of those-the Kain's fellows have started a gang, too. They're mugging marauders. Despair is making everyone grab their knife. They're fighting each other already..."
512513, "Is that so."
512514, "I bid you farewell, boös. "
512515, "Honourable Bachelor? "
512516, "The hunchback is dead, master Vlad. You were right, without him the arsonists didn't dare to act."
512517, "Yes, the one and only. Are you surprised?"
512518, "You... our family shall never forget this, doctor. It was a matter of honour. Here is the promised reward. Aside from that, the Olgimskys'... younger generation is forever in your debt."
512519, "Very well. What's done is done."
512520, "I'll kill this hunchback arsonist all right. His crowd is starting to become... annoying."
512521, "And the reward will be forthcoming, kind doctor! I beg you to stop the assault on the Termitary! I understand that it's an incredibly dangerous undertaking that will demand that you..."
512522, "Oh, stop it. I know the risks involved. In the past few days I've learned to handle a pistol no less nimbly than any regular gunslinger."
512523, "My heart is uneasy... "
512524, "You are too sensitive, Victoria. "
512525, "I've talked to him already."
512526, "I failed to stop the hunchback. Fortunately, the Termitary still stands."
512527, "Do you know that for sure? Would you vouch for it?"
512528, "How can one vouch for anything these days?"
512529, "I've found the carrier of the disease; I've tracked the carrier down! Come at once, while it's still relevant!/n/nSticky/n/nP.S. I went outside 'cause they brought me yesterday's vaccine... Otherwise I wouldn't have left the room, I swear! Sitting tight now..."
512530, "Sticky's Note "
512539, "I'll find you, Burakh."
512540, ""
512541, "You've got no business around here. Move along."
512542, "I have the right to go anywhere I want."
512543, "I've killed that creature. What was it? A golem... or something?"
512544, "I don't know! I wish we could find out... Was there no way of capturing it alive? "
512545, "There was no way I was going to even try. It still gives me shivers..."
512546, "I spoke to that creature of yours. It talked to me."
512547, "Holy cats... And then what?"
512548, "It seemed harmless to me. "
512549, "I'm innocent... Get me out of here! The disease is getting closer!"
512550, "Just wait some more."
512551, "It's here! The Sand Plague is already in the left wing! We're working our beaks to the bone taking the dead out! But the hungry jaws of the Sand Pest are rustling..."
512552, "Let the uninfected out! Quickly! "
512553, "It's futile. Although... half an hour ago a certain kind person provided us with a display of true goodwill and compassion. He'd bought out several dozen people."
512554, "I'd like to buy out the rest."
512555, "Get the cash on the nail. Even if Saburov refuses to take your money, we won't; we're not the scrupulous type. Ten thousand per person. Sixty thousand for the whole batch."
512556, "A bit too much, isn't it?"
512557, "We don't know for sure if those people are truly innocent. What if there are thieves, murderers, or looters among them? What if we let an unspeakable villain out? The price includes the risk-taking."
512558, "Can't you tell a murderer from an honest person?"
512559, "Of course we can't! It's not like the patrolgoons cared about the paperwork when they were collaring these poor souls. Who are they? What have they done to deserve this treatment? Hell if anyone knows now! Eh, forget the poor wretches. Let it go-unlike us, you can do it for free... There's only a handful of convicts left in there anyway."
512560, "Here's the money. Now you can let them go too."
512561, "You're one corrupt arsehole!"
512562, "Esteemed Bachelor?"
512563, "I've got the money. Take it."
512564, "At ease."
512565, "Well... Let them go then! Oh, we're going to miss the poor sods... although I'm pretty certain the governor will soon provide us with new company."
512566, "Oh, I hope you're not prone to missing things-that would look bad on your newly-acquired working record. I'll make sure the governor assigns you to clean up infected houses."
512567, "Here. That's not the whole sum. I don't have the time to collect sixty thousand. Take what I have."
512568, "Who could have thought that the esteemed Bachelor is also an esteemed money-grubber! That's not how it works, mate."
512569, "And you are going out of your way to fulfill it, you bastards!"
512570, "I've bailed out all the survivors."
512571, "How may were left?"
512572, "Before the day is out, all of them will likely provide plenty of reasons to lock them up or even send them to the gallows on perfectly legal grounds."
512573, "Being locked up in jail equals being sent to the gallows in the current situation. Both spell imminent death."
512574, "The Executors demand ten thousand per person."
512575, "Twenty thousand is the best I can do. Hopefully, this will restore at least a shred of the lost faith in authority."
512576, "It's a very... lump sum. Thank you."
512577, "I've paid for several people. By the time I got to the jail, there were only six prisoners left."
512578, "What about the rest?"
512579, "It's entirely possible."
512580, "Unfortunately, you are correct."
512582, "Willow"
512583, "Hunchback"
512584, "If the new governor carries on like this, strife will certainly be unavoidable. This is a judicial temper tantrum! A result of total impotence on the part of the authorities."
512585, "I already know everything. Young Olgimsky wants to bail several people out. "
512586, "I know, I've talked to Victor Kain."
512587, "He is a good man, this Vlad the Younger. Sometimes I regret that he's not in charge of the Bull Project. He is more humane than his father."
512588, "Who are these innocents?"
512589, "Such a bloody shame."
512590, "I see... Anything else?"
512591, "Secondly, in went everyone who was armed. Alarmed, people had been preparing for fights with the savage Barley's barbers. Many had armed themselves with knives and even pistols in order to protect themselves and their loved ones. "
512592, "I bailed out six. Several dozen more were bailed out by someone who chose to remain anonymous."
512593, "Young Olgimsky, perhaps?"
512594, "I don't know."
512595, "Well... We've done a good thing."
512596, "Oh? And what does he say?"
512597, "He thinks the innocent deserve to be freed."
512598, "They were bailed out by an anonymous benefactor. I actually suspected it was you..."
512599, "No! Damn it... several dozen... It wasn't the hunchbacked usurer, was it?"
512600, "I don't know."
512601, "Hmm... When those people were arrested, they were law-abiding and decent. One day later, they're criminals and rebels. Now it would only take a single word of dissent for any of them to abandon all laws except the law of survival."
512602, "Why are you so worried?"
512603, "The rest are dead. There were only six survivors."
512604, "Who was that?"
512605, "He looked remarkably shady. Dressed in a special overall and a beakmask-the nerve! How can you tell anyone's features in such clothes?"
512606, "I'm going to buy out the rest. "
512607, "I don't have that much."
512609, "These people are about to die. Waste some more of my time, and you won't get a single coin for any of them. So instead of drinking my cash away in a pub you'll find yourself in the middle of the cemetery digging graves."
512610, "Grave-digging is our direct line of work. It's our duty."
512611, "Albino"
512612, ""
512613, "Yesterday young Burakh drew someone's blood swarming with the pest. Did you see it? "
512614, "I did. I studied it myself. "
512615, "But Burakh has disappeared once again... The only person he's having relatively regular business with is Fat Vlad. But he's denying the fact. He says Burakh comes when he pleases and doesn't keep him in the loop. So whose blood has Burakh taken?"
512616, "I don't know. Any ideas?"
512617, "The governor got it into his head that Burakh has found the maneater. They had a meeting yesterday. Saburov said that he's been trying to evaluate the suspects all these days-to no avail. Big Vlad believes Burakh's efforts to have been of great service; they can compare blood samples now and find the carrier."
512618, "Whom did Saburov evaluate? I didn't hear a thing about it."
512619, "He would hardly dare publicly announce the name of the person whose decisions he's relying on so completely. It's that deranged girl. Saburov thinks she's a saint. Katerina has adopted her."
512620, "I'll talk to Saburov. "
512621, "What can I do to help in this situation? "
512622, "Another manhunt?"
512623, "It's not human blood. "
512624, "Really? Whose... what blood was it then? "
512625, "Honestly, I cannot imagine what kind of creature it could be. The working conditions prohibit me from testing anything properly."
512626, "I don't believe there is a maneater. People always want to find a whipping boy-and always end up whipping the innocent. The circle of suspects has already been established. Don't let them decide anything without your consent! Okay? Tell them you need to personally check anyone they're planning to kill."
512627, "I'll try to if I have the time."
512628, "Fine. "
512629, "It was bull's blood... maybe. I'm not entirely sure. I need to double-check it by studying a sample of bull blood."
512631, "I've seen the analysis results."
512632, "See what?"
512633, "The blood. Or maybe you've seen him extract it? They say it was a girl..."
512634, "Here we go again... Are they still so intent on trying to apprehend the plague-carrying witch?"
512635, "If they survive? What do you mean?"
512636, "Have you heard about these zealots, the exterminators? They are bent on burning the town clean of the disease, shouting something about the purifying fire. If someone passes names of these young women to the mob, they're doomed. They will burn in their own homes."
512637, "What can be done to help them?"
512638, "The Olgimskys claim they can prove the girls' innocence. Perhaps they already know who the real culprit is. Somehow I have no doubt about that. I've heard the criminal is being kept inside the Termitary."
512639, "I see. I'll talk to Olgimsky."
512640, "Who are these young women?"
512641, "Lara and Yulia's names are mentioned-and for good reason; their personal items were found on some of the dying people at the Cathedral. At least this is who governor Saburov intends to hand over."
512644, "Strangely hurried, isn't it?"
512645, "Saburov is frightened. All his measures have abjectly failed. It is clear now that he is incapable of maintaining order in the town. The Cathedral tragedy was the last nail in his coffin. Under the circumstances, he has no options but to press harder."
512648, "Did you order to arrest Lara and Yulia?"
512649, "Don't be so quick to accuse Lara. I know how to find the carrier. "
512650, "Do you already know what happened in the Cathedral?"
512651, "I'm going to. If we fail to establish which one of the two it was, both are going to the dungeons, to wait for the Inquisitor's arrival."
512652, "How?"
512653, "Yesterday I got an opportunity to study the carrier's blood. I'll simply compare the samples."
512654, "Then I will not hurry with accusations."
512655, "Wait for me to return."
512656, "On what grounds?"
512657, "Most solid. Items belonging to them were found inside the Cathedral. Lara was even identified-those few who were still able to speak mentioned her name."
512658, "She is the prime suspect."
512659, "Tragic. But at least it makes our jobs easier. The maneater rumours turned out to be true. If we catch her, things will get better. I don't want to believe that it's Lara or Yulia, but the evidence is too obvious to just let them walk, isn't it?"
512660, "Don't be so quick to accuse Yulia. I know how to find the carrier."
512661, "That's not enough."
512662, "Whatever shape this maneater takes, I will unmask her. The anonymous person who bailed out the murderous criminals and emptied the jail yesterday-that too was a woman. She came there twice. And the disease broke out in the left wing of the jail after her first visit."
512663, "But why do you think that it was one of the young women in question?"
512664, "Who else could have bailed them out? "
512665, "Anyone. "
512666, "I will check on them if an opportunity presents itself. I don't believe they are guilty, and I assume the governor has no illusions on the subject either."
512667, "Lara? Or was it Clara, maybe?"
512668, "Don't be so quick to accuse the young ladies."
512692, "What makes you think so?"
512694, "I'll do just that."
512695, "So the culprit was identified? "
512696, "Some of the dead in the Cathedral were clutching expensive items. Infected, of course. Some belonged to one, some to the other..."
512700, "I feel that unless I interfere you will kill all of them. Fine. I will check their blood."
512701, "I don't believe it."
512706, "All evidence points to the culprit being one of your charming lady friends."
512707, "What evidence?"
512708, "Yesterday she visited your isolation ward... That is, our Cathedral. How did she pass the blockade? A mystery... After her visit the Cathedral turned into a morgue. The disease spread like wildfire in a dry forest. But the woman slipped away. The gates locked from the outside she opened from the inside. "
512709, "Was she identified? "
512710, "Some of the dead in the Cathedral were clutching expensive items. Infected, of course. Some belonged to one, some to the other..."
512711, "Anything else? "
512712, "We know that it was she who entered the Termitary two days before your arrival. Examine them, Dankovsky. Look into their blood! You are now the only one who can tell the differenct between the human and the nonhuman. Point at the offender, and the others live."
512713, "I will do just that."
512714, "I feel you're going to kill them all unless I interfere. All right. I'll test their blood."
512715, "Little is known about her then. Where does the list come from? "
512719, "Ah, how I wish to give this place the laugh. The sooner, the better..."
512720, "Do you know what happened in the Cathedral? "
512721, "Anna, you are accused of what happened in the Cathedral."
512722, "It wasn't me! It's Clara! It was her, it's all her doing! Even the Saburovs have acknowledged it. They're horrified, I've been told; torn apart between affection and duty. Katerina has torn her clothes to pieces, hair unstrung, wallowing naked at her husband's feet, begging to spare her daughter!"
512723, "Clara? Why Clara? "
512724, "Because no longer than yesterday afternoon she bragged she knew a secret passage into the Cathedral. Moreover, she was planning to get inside. Go ahead and find her! It's her doing! Why is it that every time something ghastly happens in this town there's always a finger pointing at me?"
512725, "I need a sample of your blood. "
512726, "My blood? That's news! Do you think my blood is of different colour and thus deserves your most careful scrutiny?"
512727, "As for that, we'll wait and see. Perhaps until the autopsy."
512728, "Same here."
512729, "I've started to miss you already."
512730, "Your blood is strange, even though there's no horned bacteria in it. Still, you know more than you let out. Your heart is black... "
512731, "Aspity, you are accused of being a maneater. They'll come for you soon. "
512732, "Oh, you're just reeking of suspicious things!"
512733, "Yulia, you stand accused of a crime. Saburov wants to publically announce that it was you who visited the Cathedral. "
512734, "Your blood is clean, Yulia. It looks like I was wrong..."
512735, "Good day, Lara. The governor believes it's... "
512736, "You're clean. Now you know for sure that there's no reason for you to hide your eyes."
512737, "So? So? Have you met the Changeling already?"
512738, "Who?!"
512739, "Changeling! The Changeling! She's the spitting image of me! Only she's a ghost, a demon, she is not at all-not human in the slightest! A foul, evil killer-pretending to be me on purpose! I'm looking for her, looking for her everywhere! It was she who brought the disease. On purpose!"
512740, "What in the world are you talking about?"
512741, "Yes, yes! She spreads the disease from house to house! That's how it gets through walls, people open their doors to her willingly! Those gullible children, they think it's me! I only found out today! People are attracted to her, they want her to lay a hand on their lips, on their heart, they want to touch her..."
512742, "You're talking about yourself! Stop trying to pull the wool over my eyes!"
512743, "Ask anyone-she's everywhere, she follows my every step, pretending to be me! Every time I get home I even have to prove myself to my dear, my lovely Katerina! That thing is an evil demon moulded of spit and bones! She'll kill us... she'll kill us all!"
512744, "What the hell... They threw you out, and now you are here? "
512745, "I have-just now. Come closer, sweet girl."
512746, "Shut up! "
512747, "Stop shouting, will you?"
512748, "Hi doctor. "
512749, "If you so much as move, you little tramp..."
512750, "I've taken a look at your blood. It is the strangest blood I've ever seen... but it doesn't contain the thing I was looking for. Could I have lost this battle?"
512751, "And who are you then? "
512752, "Cut with the gabbling!"
512753, "I am Clara, the instrument of the miraculous power that is beyond the realm of humans. They call me the Harbinger Angel!"
512754, "There is no such angel. "
512755, "How do you know? Who are you to speak of high heavens, you, the man that is stuck in the dimness of rebellious arts and the horrors of heretical teachings! Step away from me, Bachelor! By the power that's been bestowed upon me, step away!"
512756, "You have no power over me. "
512757, "Oh, come on."
512758, "All right now, calm down! You're hysterical! "
512759, "Give me your hand. "
512760, "Please, please catch this loathesome creature! She's scared of you! She knows you've already almost killed her... Help us... "
512761, "Don't make me resort to brute force. I'm going to take a look at your blood now."
512762, "But you don't have a single needle... How are you going to puncture my arm? "
512763, "You're right... How in the world did this happen?"
512764, "I don't know... I didn't take anything... I'm not a thief, never have I ever taken anything that didn't belong to me... But if you find some-do come, do come back to me. I'll be waiting. I'll show you my blood. Just catch and destroy that creature!"
512765, "Fine... But don't you try to avoid me."
512766, "Epileptic, are you... You're staying here on the responsibility of governor Saburov and his spouse Katerina."
512767, "Yes. Will you kill her? She's after you too! And about to get you... You only managed to avoid it until now due to a single little mistake!"
512768, "'She' who?"
512769, "Hi Clara."
512770, "I hope this Changeling gets caught soon! What a despicable creature, a product of the Steppe's insanity... made of bones and clay."
512771, "Do you know that the suspect is one of the young local noblewomen?"
512772, "Who is it standing there?"
512773, "The girl? That's not her. How could you think that! Don't you see? This is my foster daughter, Clara. "
512774, "That's the one I'm looking for. "
512775, "But she's not guilty! Don't you know? She is a saint. She is helpful and kind. She heals people. She's already dragged more than a hundred men out of their graves!"
512776, "She was at the Cathedral."
512777, "It wasn't her-it was some changeling that walks around under the guise of our sweet girl. But we drove her out, and she crept to the cemetery-the proper place for this creature! She nestles there, under the wing of the insane Grace. Our daughter can't stand her as well. "
512778, "I thought you were fond of Grace-weren't you, Katerina?"
512779, "I need to take a sample of her blood. "
512780, "Grace has gone mad. I am still very much fond of the girl-yet I cannot help being angry with her! She refuses to show me the grave that the mara's hiding in!"
512781, "No, never. It would be extremely impolite of us to besmirch her with suspicion! If we through our distrust offend the grace that lives within her, she will lose her miraculous abilities. No, never. She will remain here on my responsibility. My spouse and I vouch for her. "
512782, "I declare this girl grounded. I assume the Town Hall and the governor's house are equally reliable in this respect. "
512783, "The girl must stay here until the Inquisitor comes for her. And no miracles until Karminsky arrives."
512784, "Undoubtedly."
512785, "It was bitter sarcasm. "
512786, "It'll be Orff, not Karminsky."
512787, "Orff? Really? "
512788, "Yes. Karminsky was recalled-he's needed in the field. As far as I understood, a certain delicate operation requires a hanging judge and a punisher."
512789, "How in the world is Orff unsuitable for this...?"
512790, "There is no carrier. It's a myth. "
512791, "Where's the girl? "
512792, "Gone already! She darted straight after you as soon as the door closed behind your back. It didn't even take her a minute. I was positive she went with you..."
512793, "But she was your responsibility! She was... heavens know what it was."
512794, "This cannot be... The thought never occurred to me... "
512795, "Soon you'll be the one to stand before the the Inquisitor. "
512798, "She's made a fool of you. "
512799, ""
512800, "The Steppe's rolling its brains under the Earth crust..."
512801, "Did you make that up yourself?"
512802, "No. I was taught. A mara girl is looking for you. Beware..."
512803, "Clara? "
512804, "Yes! But you don't need her; you need her twin sister. She'll help you, she helps everybody... Clara is nice, the mara is evil. The mara is a shabnak. A marad! A nastail!"
512805, "Where's Clara? "
512806, "What do you need Clara for? You need the nastail that's pretending to be Clara. They're easy to tell apart."
512807, "All right. How do I tell them apart?"
512808, "Hush! Shut up!"
512809, "The mara can't talk. Her words are like little spits of dirt. Filthy! She mutters and chatters and mumbles. People don't talk like that... And earth spills out of her mouth too."
512810, "Where can I find her?"
512811, "The mara's hiding today. Everyone's hunting her. And she's hunting you. She thinks that if she kills you, everyone will just let her go. Tee-hee..."
512812, "Damn it... Is there a single sane person in this town?"
512813, "I know, I know..."
512814, ""
512815, "My head is splitting... "
512816, "Have you seen Clara? "
512817, "She's hiding-in the infected part of the town, most likely. Or maybe somewhere by the Station... A terrible person is coming from the Capital to execute her tomorrow. She wanted to hide between the carriages, then slip onto a train and leave... but didn't want to do it without saying goodbye to Murky and Sticky first."
512818, "Who is the White Spectre? "
512819, "It's a person of the night. He's like a dead man, only he walks-wanders around at night with his limber cat. He's almost transparent. Clara made friends with him. Said if anything bad happens to him, she'll come and bring him back to life."
512820, "I killed him today. So I'll find her nearby. Thank you, Grace! "
512821, "You couldn't have. He never shows himself to anybody. If you chance to see him, he'll just fade into the darkness-and he's not around during the day, he never is. Like a foggy well around the moon."
512822, "Grace, does Clara have a twin sister? "
512823, "Shabnak-adyr's made a habit of pretending to be Clara. She came to me once. Talked to me. I didn't realize it at first, and then I wondered-why was she so tall? So I looked down and saw it. She had no feet, just broken bones sticking out of her shoes! So scary! I was so short of breath, I ran away! And she had such an evil scowl... Laughing..."
512824, "And what did she say? "
512825, "Lots of things. She even mentioned you. Said she was looking for you. Said she wanted to lure you into a trap. To fool the doctor. Said the doctor's not so smart... That she fooled everyone and she's going to fool him too. Turn his needles into hooks so he won't prick her hands."
512826, "How horrible... "
512827, "Damn... "
512828, "Oh my dear... Let me have a look."
512852, ""
512854, "You look like hell, mate... So you've changed your mind and become the master of cremations after all? Is this how you want to die?"
512855, "Silence! Listen to my confession. I'd rather confess to you than to her... Listen-and I shall tell you of what I had managed to create... When I studied architecture, for a longest time I remained passive and didn't do or make anything at all-except observations. It always seemed to me that any house is so much more than walls, a hearth, and a roof! "
512856, "But this is treachery... "
512857, "It is. See-I was smart enough to take the designs of my creation to the parting."
512858, "Stop! I have a better idea. "
512859, "Give them to me. As a keepsake."
512860, "Really?"
512861, "Go help your brother. Do you know that he's been arrested? He's killed several people trying to help you. "
512862, "...That's fine. I've been suffering for ten years because of him. "
512865, "So you don't care? "
512866, "No one does... "
512869, "Maria... Maria is turning into a chrysalis now. Who knows what kind of butterfly will flutter out from it? And by the way-Maria is your to unite with now, not mine..."
512871, "Send me the dark blue flame! I desire to burn down not in earthly, but in heavenly fire! So please, do bring me this spicy spirit! Bring me my smoky, dense, odorous sap! I want to burn myself in twyrine!"
512875, "Old boy! I'm thirsty, old boy. Bring me five bottles of twyrine-and you can have the designs... No one would be able to decipher them anyway. And if they do-no one would build it..."
512876, "Fine. I'll bring them to you. Wait for me and don't do anything stupid. I'll be back soon. "
512879, "But why here? And why do you look like this?"
512880, "Have you been inside the Tower? "
512881, "The children won't let me inside."
512882, "Oh... So you haven't dived into the well?"
512883, "No. "
512884, "It's a multidimensional space. It is turned unto itself. It has no surfaces, borders, or bounds. It has no mass. It has no end."
512885, "I don't believe you."
512886, "Then go and see for youself. Just let the children teach you how to get back. "
512887, "But this is a sensation! A groundbreaking discovery that will turn the world upside down!"
512888, "The discovery is not mine. I've nothing to be proud of, really... I've stumbled across it by accident. Moreover, I don't really understand how it works. I've studied my own calculations inside out-and I still don't get it. Something's off, but what? That is the question..."
512889, "Well, I never... an architect of schizophrenia! "
512890, "Alcohol is too flammable, Peter... Let's not take unnecessary risks."
512891, ""
512892, "One blow after another... Clara is becoming a Mistress of the Earth... a dreadful one, too... She's ruthless and cruel... fanatics believe her... and she'd happily burn us all at stakes! I can feel this horrible heat with my very skin..."
512893, "Is this not true? "
512898, ""
512899, "Bachelor! I would like you to explain a certain important point to me. You have a close relationship with the Kains, do you not?"
512900, "Where could those blueprints be?"
512901, "The Kains surely know everything. Maybe they keep copies of the blueprints. After all, that chimera was built under their patronage. Let them be the ones to make excuses now."
512902, "I don'think so. That structure is a product of Peter Stamatin's wild imagination... I'll speak with him."
512904, "Why? It's something to be proud of, not make excuses for."
512905, "I'm listening to an equal, Bachelor..."
512906, "Here are the blueprints. Hopefully you'll treat them with utmost care. They will probably become a bibliographical rarity even before the author passes away."
512907, "Well... let us take a look at the blueprints then... What do you think?"
512908, "It's an absolute masterpiece."
512909, "Whatever it is, it is a world-class sensation."
512910, "It's rubbish. A pointless delusion conjured up by a lunatic."
512911, "I'm speaking to an equal, Inquisitor."
512912, "What is your initial opinion on the blueprints? "
512913, "Is that what you think? Well, I'll have a look... Go now-and only come back here after a while. Preferrably tomorrow."
512914, "Just as I intended."
512915, "Ugh... my initial opinion is that of amazement. As far as I understand, such a structure simply cannot hold... All of this could only work if this chamber was floating in a weightless state... Those charts are nothing but an intellectual fancy, a mindgame... like a perpetuum mobile."
512916, "An apt comparison indeed."
512917, "Peter said the exact same thing."
512918, "So how does it all stay in balance? Especially with a thousand children inside. I don't understand."
512919, "The base of the stairs is extremely strong and the materials are remarkably light. That's the townfolk's explanation."
512920, "Listen, I need to study this some more... Come to me next morning. I feel that we are on the right path; this is where the catch is. Metaphysics aside... there has to be some practical reason for its existence, wouldn't you agree?"
512921, "I hope to live to see the morning and not die of curiosity."
512922, "We have little time. Block says that the soldiers are getting restless. The Sand Plague has reached the encampments. The troops are about to riot."
512923, "Hopefully, he'll be able to keep them in check for a day or two... won't he? And that's all the time we need."
512924, "And what if he's not?"
512959, ""
512960, "Oh, just the person I wanted to see! We've had quite an adventure here. My knife loves strife-it has a gripe with the type filled with tripe! So tell me, what would be best-should I drag my little brother over here to always have him by my side, or rather move to his place?"
512961, "That's... Grief-ese, isn't it? You're talking just like him! The type filled with what? How did you put it?"
512963, "...Whom did you kill?"
512964, "You see, my dear brother is seeing pink elephants. He's talking to bottles. The conversations seem to be enlightening, too-he mostly does the listening. And so he got it into his head... As far as I understood, he decided that he was at his limit and wanted to try his luck."
512965, "Is he in a crisis? Let me guess-it started yesterday?"
512966, "I'll never leave my little brother again... I'll stay right by his side. And I won't let anyone come close, too-at least closer than my knife can fly!"
512967, "He may have withdrawn too far away from you while you were wasting your time boasting here..."
512969, "This is ridiculous."
512970, "...I fear Peter will die today... If that happens... a part of the world will peter out with him... an everlasting, irreparable loss... there has never been and will never be an architect like him..."
512971, "How can I make him change his mind? "
512972, "Tell him that I am turning into a Mistress. Tell him I can feel the scarlet lava. Tell him I am ready to accept it into my womb... Tell him my mother is looking at me now... I shall become her, I shall overcome her... and I shall build what he had conceived... that is why I'll preserve the Tower. Tell him... I feel he's with Andrey now."
512973, "I will. I was going to visit Andrey anyway. "
512974, "Actually, there was no reason for you to come see me today... for I am a chrysalis."
512975, "I know... And you seem to be looking through me, am I right?"
513016, "Karminsky... Like what we lack right now is a vampire of an Inquisitor! "
513017, "At least he might manage to restore this town to some semblance of order... I can't work in these conditions!"
513018, "We'll talk later."
513019, "No. I need nothing."
513020, "I declare this girl grounded. I assume the Town Hall and the governor's house are equally reliable in this respect. "
513021, "She's hiding-in the infected part of the town, most likely. Or maybe somewhere by the Station... A terrible person is coming from the Capital to execute her tomorrow. She wanted to hide between the carriages, then slip onto a train and leave... but didn't want to do it without saying goodbye to the White Spectre."
513022, "Grace, does Clara have a twin sister? "
513023, "Shabnak-adyr's made a habit of pretending to be Clara. She came to me once. Talked to me. I didn't realize it at first, and then I wondered-why was she so tall? So I looked down and saw it. She had no feet, just broken bones sticking out of her shoes! So scary! I was so short of breath, I ran away! And she had such an evil scowl... Laughing..."

513025, "Lots of things. She even mentioned you. Said she was looking for you. Said she wanted to lure you into a trap. To fool the doctor. Said the doctor's not so smart... That she fooled everyone and she's going to fool him too. Turn his needles into hooks so he won't prick her hands."
513026, "Damn... "
513027, "That's horrible..."
513029, "...Why are you following me? I'm barely walking..."
513030, "I'd rather had you embedded into the ground, you freak."
513031, "I'm listening."
513032, "It's nothing. I still can't quite collect my thoughts."
513033, "You have been sent to fight an adversary that inherently cannot be beaten-in foolish hopes that a miracle would happen and your outstanding mind would stumble upon that one-in-a-million chance. And just so that you wouldn't give up, they kept insisting that the adversary must be destroyed. Do you see how insidious the Powers That Be are?"
513034, "But why? Their motives are becoming less and less comprehensible to me by the day..."
513035, "I've been told that either Karminsky or Orff was coming."
513036, "Are you disappointed?"
513052, "Indeed. It's complicated. They will become even less comprehensible when I tell you that I have been ordered to preserve this settlement at any cost-and accepting any losses-and yet they deployed army detachments here. And now for the interesting part. Do you know who is in command? Do you even know what army I'm talking about? "
513053, "I'm all ears."
513054, "The commander is Alexander Block, the war hero. The mind-and hand-behind the upcoming military reform. The Karstov Fords, the broken front.... You must've heard of him.  "
513055, "...No way!"
513056, "It's not a sanitary army. They have neither the special equipment, nor even any weapons appropriate for the task. As a matter of fact, it's just two artillery regiments that had been marching towards the front line after performing successful maneuvers, and a hastily assigned company of sanitary flamethrower corps. Don't you find that strange?"
513057, "Yes. Quite."
513058, "Rings any bells? Any stunning similarities that spring to your mind?"
513059, "No."
513060, "Of course there are... Block reminds me of myself. And-of you, I suppose?"
513061, "Isn't it convenient that Block just happened to be here by sheer coincidence! 'Just conducting maneuvers nearby.' A visionary of military science! Loathed by the entirety of our military's top brass! He personally received the train carrying a new long-range cannon that was being transported to the front by way of the north-western railroad. And now..."
513074, "Indeed. All this time there have been several watchers active in the town. At least three are known. They kept numbers, wrote down their observations. Visited homes unbeknownst to the town's rulers, disguised as corpse carriers. It was they-one of them-who sent you those daily letters."
513075, "Here's what I managed to take from the watchers."
513076, "How absurd! Who would need that?"
513077, "The Powers That Be. It was they, not the Kains, who did their best to guide you to a conclusion that would bring victory. Any false hypothesis could have been fatal. Time was too short for everyone to pursue an erroneous theory. But the most important thing is that the Power That Be knew what was about to begin here."
513078, "This particular epidemic?"
513079, "I don't think so. Otherwise, they'd have been better prepared. I have no doubt that they are desperate to preserve this little town. No, they didn't know what exactly was going to happen here. And that's the most mind-boggling part! But they were ready for trouble-all of their emissaries came adequately informed."
513080, "So the illustrous Alexander Block wasn't sent here to set up a quarantine either..."
513081, "I concur. Block was hastily directed here in case the town faces a... threat, that could be dealt with through military might."
513082, "Informed of what?"
513083, "So what did the Powers That Be know?"
513084, "That is the mystery I'm trying to solve. That is the puzzle that's on my mind the most-rather than the origin of this strange affliction, which I'm going to leave to you, Daniil."
513085, "Where shall we start?"
513086, "I want to study the watchers' reports. But to even obtain them I will require your help. I suspect they're under strict orders to keep me completely in the dark. Just as they did you, Bachelor, only a few days ago..."
513108, "A sanitary army, I suppose..."
513110, "Why didn't they find a simpler man for this mission?"
513111, "But why?"
513112, "To make our bright minds derive the correct solution independently of any outside sources. That's the reason. So, if I send someone for them or personally go to collect their reports, they will destroy them. They may even opt to go into hiding or commit suicide. So I ask you to act... on my behalf."
513113, "If they won't give their reports to you, why would they give them to me?"
513114, "Your mission is over. And their lives are in danger. I believe they will try to escape my all-seeing eye before today is over."
513115, "What makes you think so?"
513116, "I'm going to show my hand to you now. The Powers That Be and I are fighting the same enemy-but that doesn't mean we're on the same side. The emissaries know of my... feelings towards them. They expect to be slaughtered-and rightfully so. Their actions towards me will be adequate to those expectations."
513117, "One of them? What do you mean?"
513118, "It means that there is a traitor and a liar among them. They intentionally distorted the information knowing that sooner or later it was going to find its way into my hands. But we'll get to that later."
513119, "What, they knew of the epidemic before it began?"
513120, "Very well. How will I find them?"
513121, "They've had to walk around a lot. To observe, to examine... They must have the appearance of those who do the dirtiest work here. An elaborate disguise. I predict that they're going to crawl out into the daylight today, no matter where they have been hiding before. "
513122, "Where could they have been hiding?"
513123, "How should I know? I've only been here for a few hours whereas you've been here for a week. Ask the local rulers. I would suppose they're spread out evenly throughout the town. One was certainly active here in the Stone Yard, one in the Knots, and the last one in Earth."
513124, "You're really well-informed, aren't you."
513125, "What are you going to do while I'm looking for the watchers?"
513126, "I'll interrogate the members of the ruling families and many others who I deem worthy of attention. Today is local elite day. Our previous conversation ended quite abruptly when we were just getting to the most interesting part: the source. I know."
513127, "I wish to ask a favour of you. I've expended significant effort convincing everyone to stay at home and not venture outside. The very air in these streets is deadly. At times I've risked my life just to avoid a worse risk..."
513128, "I see."
513129, "Some favour! Do you expect me to go door to door like some delivery girl? I'm not afraid of the disease, but it does not become me! I speak to you in a friendly tone because I want us to trust each other, but to everyone else I'm an Inquisitor. Have you forgotten what kind of position that is?"
513130, "In that case please make sure that any person your people take outside takes immune drugs."
513131, "Fine. I'll see to that. In fact, I intend to liquidate the Olgimskys' medicine stockpile and personally oversee the distribution."
513132, "Very well."
513133, "Just leave some for their personal use."
513134, "No. We were expecting a punisher, and instead..."
513135, "...An angel descended? No. Personally for you, at best. My disposition is fearsome, which you will have ample opportunity to observe. There's lots of blood to spill. But I'm positive-and this is what makes me different from Karminsky-that I can keep the body count to a necessary minimum."
513136, "I can't believe my luck. Yesterday I was sure everything was lost. "
513138, "That comes with the line of work, I suppose."
513139, "Don't jump to conclusions. I'm still a government inquisitor. You know we are sanctioned use any methods, with no concern for anything. There is no law for us but the law of efficiency in completing our current mission."
513140, "Right. I know."
513141, "Why was the punishment so quick?"
513143, "An unfortunate accident. I'm truly sorry that everything turned as it did. I was going to question the honourable Executor thoroughly tonight. Or perhaps the poor sap saw it coming, so he jumped off of his own free will. What do you think?"
513144, "I think poking my nose into this was a mistake."
513150, "Right... let me see... Yes, that's about what I was expecting... Numbers, dates, notes. Very good. If only those seeds of truth weren't intermixed with so much chaff, this could give us a dramatic push in the right direction."
513151, "Excuse me?"
513152, "It seems simple comparison won't be enough to figure out the false report... They all describe different things... And there might be two false ones... A pity... Daniil! We must hurry, before they are gone! Find out which one of them is which. Outsmart them."
513153, "Outsmart them? How?"
513154, "One of them is a liar and a traitor. I suspect it was they that sent you those letters that would enrage you so and even endanger your life. One of those reports is a farewell gift from them. A false lead that will put you on a false trail."
513155, "But why would they write down lies? If the Powers That Be seek to preserve the town..."
513156, "Because they're a traitor. We need to know which one of them. Moreover, they've been trying to get a second one on their side as well, and that one began to hesitate... Only the third one remained honest until the end."
513157, "How did you find that out? "
513158, "A friend gave me something before I left for this place... He knew some of the internal workings of this whole affair. And questioning Vlad Olgimsky confirmed my hypothesis. Both he and Saburov knew that there were watchers active around here."
513159, "Yet they told me nothing! "
513160, "They may have been intimidated into keeping silent."
513161, "...And what about the Kains? Did they know?"
513162, "No. The Kains don't even know that the sun rises in the east-it is beneath them."
513163, "Fine. How can I help you?"
513164, "Fine. How can I help you?"
513165, "Try to find out which one of them is the liar. Like in that old riddle, the traitor is sure to lie. Someone who hesitates could both lie and tell the truth. The last one will be truthful until the end-but even the truthful watcher won't be very forthcoming. Are you up to the task?"
513166, "Yes. I think I know how to do it."
513167, "You would fare better."
513168, "No. They wouldn't tell me anything at all-even if I resorted to torture. These watchers are a special breed. Different from you and me. "
513169, "Very well. I'll try."
513170, "One more thing. My intuition tells me that you have no room for error. These people are extremely desperate now. If you accuse the truthful watcher or the one who is still hesitating... they might react unpredictably. I know their kind. You will only have one shot."
513171, "I see. You want to take the opportunity to test my mental faculties... But I don't mind that."
513172, "Would it make sense to provoke them?"
513173, "It would. The traitor is afraid. Olgimsky informed me of that. We just need to put a noose around their neck and they'll climb the nearest lamppost by themselves."
513174, "Very well. We'll see which is which."
513175, "How can I help you, good sir?"
513176, "Of course. Here you go. Don't come here again. We'll be gone soon."
513177, "I know that one of you always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third does a little bit of both. I hope you're not going to deny that?"
513178, "That is true. But how does that help you?"
513179, "Which of those are you?"
513180, "Which of the three was the Knots watcher?"
513181, "Which of the three was the Earth watcher?"
513182, "I am the honest servant, of course. Were you expecting a different answer?"
513183, "The liar and the traitor."
513184, "That's the one who does a little bit of both. His words are part truth, part lies."
513185, "You are the traitor!"
513186, "Undoubtedly."
513187, "I'll go talk to him."
513188, "No. You are the liar and the traitor!"
513189, "I'll go talk to him."
513190, "You know, I think you are the lying bastard!"
513191, "Wrong. But since I don't think I can change your mind, I'd be better off killing you. I've risked my life for far too long to throw it away right before leaving this forsaken place!"
513192, "Damn it..."
513193, "Don't mind me."
513195, "You are the traitor!"
513196, "No one is going anywhere without my approval."
513197, "Ah, my honorable fellow! Are you the Earth one or the Knots one?"
513198, "Earth."
513199, "Knots."
513200, "Does it really matter?"
513201, "Of course it matters! I want to get even with the double-crossing bastard because his misdeeds almost cost me my life! But I can make peace with a fellow agent who gave in to the temptation in hour of hardship. So which are you?"
513202, "Someone who doesn't believe you to begin with."
513203, "I'm the Earth one."
513204, "I'm the Knots one."
513205, "And you had the guts to come here? You bastard! I'd make away with you myself, were I not a believer in the freedom of choice-so be it. Choose: either you die here and now or you go to the Inquisitor and confess!"
513206, "Let's skip the word-micing here. Everyone knows I've always been loyal. I've never betrayed myself or the Powers That Be. Whoever you are, you know that very well."
513207, "Perhaps."
513209, "You'll be the one doing the dying!"
513210, "Then let's go. Let's kill the traitor together."
513211, "Wait here. I'll be back soon."
513212, "I am the Knots watcher."
513213, "I need your papers."
513214, "Straight from the Inquisitor?"
513215, "Curious..."
513216, "So what? Do we flee now? Which one are you, by the way?"
513217, "The Earth one."
513218, "Let's go together, you and me. I'm scared of this zealot, the Bachelor. Just wait and see-as soon as we're back, he'll inform on us in the blink of an eye!"
513219, "Wait here. I'll be back soon."
513220, "The Stone Yard one."
513221, "What do you want from me? Everyone is free to make their own choice! Besides, I liked leading that thick-headed Bachelor a pretty dance."
513222, "I want nothing from you."
513223, "Now I will be your dancing partner, good sir. You're coming with me!"
513224, "What do you care?"
513231, "How can I help you, good sir?"
513232, "I know that one of you is always truthful, another one always lies, and the third one does a little bit of both. I hope you're not going to deny that?"
513233, "That is true. But how does that help you?"
513234, "Which of those are you?"
513235, "I am the honest servant, of course. Were you expecting a different answer?"
513236, "You are the traitor!"
513239, "Undoubtedly."
513240, "Which of the three was the Stone Yard watcher?"
513241, "That's the one. The liar and the traitor."
513242, "I'll go talk with him."
513243, "No. You are the liar and the traitor!"
513244, "Which of the three was the Earth watcher?"
513245, "The one who does both. He is partly true, partly full of lies."
513246, "I'll go talk with him."
513247, "You know, I think you are the lying bastard!"
513248, "You are the traitor!"
513249, "Don't mind me."
513250, "Yes."
513251, "No. I'm on my own."
513252, "Then I have nothing to say to you. Go away!"
513253, "How about I try brute force?"
513254, "That would be ill-advised."
513255, "There's a patrolman just around the corner. Should I call for him?"
513256, "Take them then. I don't need them anymore, thank goodness. We'll be gone by evening. Until then, please don't mention us to the Inquisitor! That would be the end of us."
513257, "But why?"
513258, "She's an evil witch. And a condemned one, too! This whole mission is just her final vacation before the gallows. She won't miss any chance to get even with the Powers That Be or their representatives."
513259, "That's where you are wrong! The Bachelor is me."
513260, "No! You are the traitor."
513261, "I am the Earth watcher. Are you here on business?"
513262, "I need your papers."
513263, "Aglaya doesn't know that we're here yet, does she?"
513264, "She does."
513265, "Bad news... That means we have to flee as soon as possible. We'll get together and go. Don't inform the Inquisitor of our location-at least not until the evening. Okay?"
513266, "Sure. Hand me the papers."
513267, "Yes, of course. Here you go."
513268, "Much obliged."
513269, "Who's that?"
513270, "All right, take them. Maybe they'll help you more than they helped us. We'll be gone by the evening. But until then, please don't tell about us to the Inquisitor. That would be the end of us."
513271, "But why?"
513272, "She has nothing to lose. She knows there are rats among us, the rats who have caused you a lot of trouble and will probably cause her a lot of trouble too. I think she will butcher all of us- the Watchers, the Executors... Guilty or innocent."
513273, "She doesn't strike me as the cruel type."
513274, "Actually, I have also just come to know of your existence."
513275, "How?"
513276, "By chance."
513277, "Come on. There's no need to pretend."
513278, "Maybe she does. I know nothing about it."
513279, "Where do you work?"
513280, "In the Knots."
513281, "Hey, do you think you stand a chance at all? If she finds out what you've been doing, she will break you on the wheel..."
513282, "I'll manage."
513283, "Enough with the smooth talk! You're the one to blame!"
513284, "In the Stone Yard."
513285, "Don't be too hard on me. I'd be merciful on the other guy too if I were you..."
513286, "I won't."
513287, "Come to the Inquisitor with me. If there's anyone who deserves no mercy, that's you!"
513289, "To what do I owe the pleasure, Bachelor?"
513290, "I know that one of you is always truthful, another one always lies, and the third one does a little bit of both. I hope you're not going to deny that?"
513291, "That's true. How do you know that?"
513292, "Which of those are you?"
513293, "I am the honest servant, of course."
513295, "Undoubtedly."
513296, "Which of the three was the Stone Yard watcher?"
513297, "The one in between. His words are half-true, half-lies."
513298, "I'll go talk to him."
513299, "You know what? I think you are the lying bastard!"
513300, "Which of the three was the Knots watcher?"
513301, "The Honest Watcher."
513302, "If he was honest, then what are you?"
513303, "No. You are the traitor and you are the liar!"
513304, "You are the traitor."
513305, "Don't mind me."
513306, "You are a liar and a traitor!"
513307, "Lies! And so that no one ever calls me a liar again, I will teach you a lesson!"
513308, "Wait..."
513309, "Everyone makes mistakes sometimes."
513310, "What does that mean?"
513311, ""
513312, "All is for the best in this best of the worlds. "
513313, "That's highly unlikely."
513314, "I need an Executor mask... and a cloak. Do you have any to spare?"
513315, "My God! Have you finally decided to join my troupe? Oh no, no, but that would be too much of an honour... So... Has the Inquisitor demoted you to an Executor?"
513316, "Something like that. "
513317, "I need the mask and the cloak to do a job."
513318, "Says everyone who wants to remain unidentified. You are not entirely honest, esteemed sir!"
513319, "So what if I'm not?"
513320, "Every piece of clothing in my possession had to be distributed. Mass burials are a full-fledged business now. They've confiscated all the stage props."
513321, "Yes, it's uncannily similar to..."
513322, "Indeed. We all fell into the same trap."
513323, "If only I could get even with them..."
513325, "STONE YARD WATCHMAN'S REPORT. Report from the watcher who worked in the higher part of town. Contains statements, estimates, reports, notes, and statistics. "
513326, "EARTH WATCHMAN'S REPORT. Report of the watcher who worked in the poor part of town. Contains statements, estimates, reports, notes, and statistics. "
513327, "KNOTS WATCHMAN'S REPORT. Report of the watcher who worked in the middle part of town. Contains statements, estimates, reports, notes, and statistics. "
513334, "Inquisitor"
513335, "Who did? "
513336, "Saburov. He has appointed one of the well-respected townspeople as the master of cremations. That is a death sentence, of course; I doubt anyone could survive that assignment... Well, obviously you can also try to get an outfit from an Executor-they do still have them. I saw them dig a pit in a lot by the Cemetery today. Many of them stayed there too."
513337, "What kind of lot? "
513338, "Just a lot by the Cemetery. Go ask them. I'm sure they'll find a spare mask and cloak for you. And if they don't, address your complaints to Saburov."
513339, "Fine."
513340, "Did you give the order to stop burying and to start cremating? "
513341, "Yes. As a one last thing. Right before handing it all to Aglaya Lilich."
513342, "And who did you appoint to manage the burials?"
513343, "...One Peter Stamatin. You don't know him."
513344, "You've sentenced him to death."
513345, "He deserved it."
513346, "I don't doubt that. But still, how exactly? I guess it would make sense to ask the man himself."
513347, "Revoke your decision! Choose someone else!"
513348, "There is no person in this town who deserves death more than Peter Stamatin. Even if street murderers were responsible and ambitious enough for the job, I'd still choose him over them. I don't have to explain my choices to you."
513349, "I said, revoke it."
513350, "No. The decision is final and is not up for a debate."
513351, "We'll see about that."
513352, ""
513353, "Nice to see you... so, you have a brother too? "
513354, "Nice to see you as well."
513355, "I've been told that you've been given some stage props... Executor outfits?"
513356, "It is. Saburov didn't have an opportunity to finish me off fair and square. I am not subject to court... due to me being of unsound mind. And now he has a chance to get rid of me gracefully and reliably. By the way, I've given the cloaks away to Executors. I've only left one mask for myself. It's an omen."
513357, "But why? "
513358, "He thinks I'm a vicious murderer. There was an abominable crime... Old business! I'll tell this to you and to you only-it wasn't my fault... but I ended up taking the blame. I didn't kill him! I wanted to, yes. I could have..."
513359, "What the hell? How many people have killed someone around here lately? They are all murderers! I wish at least one tenth of them were punished! "
513360, "Yes, yes... Right you are... Actually, I wish they'd give me a three-day delay-nothing more! Do you think... Do you think it would possible to arrange for them to leave me alone until... say, Friday?"
513361, "Only three days? Why?"
513362, "I need to finish my greatest creation. It won't take long, it's just blueprints... and calculations-see? Then I could go ahead and die without a moment's delay. Can't anyone find a way to deal with the bastard-especially now that he's given up his powers? Maybe you could help?"
513363, "The Inquisitor can probably bring the former governor to his senses. I'll talk to her. "
513364, "Actually, there's nothing dangerous about your task. The disease withers in dead bodies."
513365, "I won't be in charge of burying the dead-I'll have to make sure that no living people have gone six feet under alongside them. I do not know if the disease can inhabit corpses, but the death rate among masters of burials is almost absolute. Everyone gets infected and dies sooner or later. "
513366, "Yes, I have. You know already? "
513367, "Is it true that you were appointed master of cremations? "
513368, "Rest assured, Peter, I'll see to it all. I'll talk to the Inquisitor. You'll be left in peace."
513369, "Thank you, old boy. I'm not asking for myself, but for the art..."
513370, "Hush. I don't need your excuses."
513371, "I'm not sure if it's doable..."
513372, "Then I cannot give you the sacred symbol of my new position. I'd only trade it for three days of freedom. "
513373, "I'll think about it."
513374, "Peter, I'll talk to the Inquisitor. Stay in."
513375, "I couldn't go out even if I wanted to. I'm barely standing. Well, at least I'll have one last gulp of sap..."
513376, "Just don't overdo it."
513377, "I want to ask a favour of you. Saburov, abusing the power he's been given, is endangering the life of a certain Peter Stamatin."
513378, "Why?"
513379, "It seems he's trying to settle a personal grudge."
513380, "And who is that Peter Stamatin?"
513381, "Well... a person."
513382, "He's my friend."
513383, "The creator of the specular tower on the other side of the river."
513384, "Oh? Then his life more than deserves to be saved."
513385, "Thank you."
513386, "And how exactly is Saburov needlessly endangering his life?"
513387, "He put Stamatin in charge of burials and cremations. The work is highly dangerous since he has to deal with the dying all the time."
513388, "We can fix that. We'll find a replacement."
513389, "You have my gratitude."
513390, "Peter... Peter? Can you hear me? You are not the master of cremations and burials anymore. "
513391, "Oh... How appropriate, old boy... So, I can get back to work now. Take the mask, I will have no need of it for now. Although I could use it to mix ink... "
513392, "Working in this condition is useless though, isn't it?"
513409, "Time is short..."
513410, "It always is."
513411, "What's your opinion of the Kains?"
513412, "There's anarchy in the Termitary."
513413, "What would you suggest?"
513414, "The Polyhedron. It's the most recent construction project this town has had."
513415, "I'd start with the wells-or rather with a very particular well that's been bothering me for a while now."
513416, "According to your notes, the disease might have sprung from below the ground. Am I correct?"
513417, "The Abattoir. I still haven't got a chance to get in there-and I suspect this is where it all began."
513421, "Indeed-just like the previous plague epidemic. That epidemiological hazard appeared in the south during coal mining; and the climate was comparable to the local one too, by the way."
513422, ""
513423, "You shouldn't have come, oynon. It's dangerous here. You're not used to dealing with them..."
513424, "What are you doing here, Burakh?"
513425, "I went to the Abattoir and came back with something of value. Listen to me, oynon... If my hope proves to be true, we'll have a serum by tomorrow."
513426, "That's some news! So what was that... thing you came back with?"
513427, "Blood. Blood again. I'm not ready to say where I got it. But it may very well be what Stakh worked on... only better. It's still alive. Look if it has... you know?"
513428, "So you just want me to examine this blood under a microscope? Just that?"
513429, "If you study this blood, oynon, tomorrow I'll hand you a dose of functional panacea. And if you prove this is the the blood we need... might be I hand the panacea to you today. I trust your word. Is this convincing enough for you?"
513430, "It is. Where do I find you?"
513431, "I'll be around here. Still have a hell of a lot to do. If there's trouble, I'll let you know. Then we should meet in that basement under the Corpulent Workshop. "
513432, "All right."
513433, "Tell me, how do I get inside the Abattoir?"
513434, "The gates are blocked with boulders from the inside. When the time comes, butchers roll them aside. You can find a way in after that. Wait for the right moment."
513435, "And when are the boulders rolled aside? At what time?"
513436, "There is some kind of regularity, but I haven't cracked it yet. Tried to squeeze it out of the Mother Superior, but she's only fooling around. I can never understand if she's serious or not."
513437, "Are they going to be opened today?"
513438, "There is a massive butcher feud inside, they're fighting each other. Something displeased them quite a bit... I might have played a part in it, I'm afraid. The Mother Superior claims that everything should quiet down after midnight. Maybe about two o'clock they'll roll away the boulder blocking the main entrance. They'll let you in after that if the Mother allows it."
513439, "Do butchers even get sick? I haven't seen a single butcher die of the Sand Plague."
513440, "That is... a curious fact. I mean, I have seen sick butchers, but very few of them. Almost all the dead Steppe men found in the Termitary were murdered. But there were also sick ones, though, I know that for certain."
513441, "You've been to the Termitary during the lockdown, haven't you?"
513442, "Yes. I have. But don't ask me who led me in."
513444, "What are you afraid of?"
513445, "I'm not afraid of anything. But way too many people died right in front of me these last few days. Not of the plague, but rather by malicious will of those too keen to execute their idea of justice. You know what I mean."
513446, "Yes, I understand."
513447, "I've checked the blood. Whose blood is it, Burakh? It's not human."
513448, "Then you're free to go and test my makeshift panacea on someone. It should work."
513449, "And... how much of this potion can be made?"
513450, "Not much for now. Ten, fifteen doses. Save it, oynon."
513451, "So now we have a serum?"
513452, "Of a kind. Here, take it. It's sort of a natural extract."
513453, "That's some wish-wash..."
513454, "Give it back then."
513455, "No, wait..."
513456, "Take it then! Bloody hell... Waste of time is what that was."
513457, "Have you tested it?"
513458, "My word be my bond. It should be effective."
513459, "Fine. I'll try it."
513460, "It's dangerous everywhere."
513461, ""
513462, "You have stayed... I'm surprised. I was sure you'd take the first opportunity to leave this place."
513463, "Taya is fine. Alive and well."
513476, "Thank you! She means so much for me."
513477, "You are friends?"
513478, "You could say that. I am the daughter of my mother. I'll take her place in less than three years."
513479, "Take care, Victoria."
513480, "I could say that... or...?"
513481, "I have my own designs, bachelor Dankovsky. I can reveal them to Artemy Burakh only-and mosr certainly not to you. I apologize."
513482, "I understand."
513483, "If only I had one..."
513491, "Why are they fighting?"
513492, "Yesterday, after they were released, they had a council of sorts. Today they split in half. Some demand the Foreman's death, others, it seems, want to have their way with Olgimsky. In all honesty, I'm confused and don't have a slightest idea what's happening. The Mother says there's a fierce battle in there."
513493, "But you have been to the Termitary before?"
513494, "And what if she doesn't?"
513495, "Then better not to try it at all. They will attack you as soon as you get inside, and not only that, they'll send out a party to chase you. Don't play games with them, oynon. The local ways out to be respected."
513496, "Here he is, here he comes! Listen everyone, this is a doctor. He came from outside. Will you do me a favour?"
513497, "What about tomorrow?"
513498, "Maybe tomorrow. Maybe even this night."
513499, "What does it depend on?"
513500, "Depend? What do you mean?"
513501, "...Why is it forbidden now but will be allowed at night?"
513502, "What do you mean, why? Because I feel that way."
513503, "And what exactly do you feel?"
513504, "Gladly. Will you let me into the Abattoir then?"
513505, "First of all, what are you doing here? This is no place for a little girl."
513506, "I'm not a little girl. I'm the Mother Superior."
513507, "How old are you?"
513508, "My daddy was in charge here. Now I'm in charge. Because he's dead. So who cares now if I'm little or not?"
513509, "Was your daddy a commandant of this dosshouse?"
513510, "My daddy was the Father Superior of the butchers. He safeguarded everyone who lives here and took care of them. He's dead now. And everyone's sick... It's because I'm still little."
513511, "Do you guard everyone around here too?"
513512, "I don't 'guard', I safeguard... yes. Because I'm the Mother Superior."
513513, "Who?"
513514, "Mother S-U-P-E-R-I-O-R. That means I'm super important."
513515, "Oh, I see... Who called you that?"
513516, "No one called me that! It's not a name! Everyone in our family was a Superior. Daddy was the Father Superior."
513517, "Why Mother?"
513518, "Because everyone loves me. Everyone obeys me here. My word is indisputable."
513519, "Who's your daddy?"
513520, "You don't say! You're so little and yet you're in charge of this place?"
513521, "Then tell them to leave me be."
513522, "I can't. I don't know if you're a good person or a bad person."
513523, "I'm a good person."
513524, "I've been sent here by Capella. She trusts me."
513525, "I hope so."
513526, "Is there anything I can do for you?"
513527, "You'll see."
513528, "Will you bring me the person that got us all locked in here when everybody got sick?"
513529, "Fine. Were you here when the epidemic broke out?"
513530, "A pidemic?"
513531, "When people got sick and began to die."
513532, "Of course I was here. If not for me, everyone who's upstairs would also be sick and dead. I was here, so there wasn't a Mother Superior in the other building. That's why everyone's dead there."
513533, "Are the people upstairs alive?"
513534, "When we knock on the ceiling, they say that they're about to come down and make us all regret this."
513535, "Regret what exactly?"
513536, "How did it all start?"
513537, "It's a secret. The old man says it began with noxious clots rising from beneath the ground."
513538, "'The old man' is Isidor, right?"
513539, "Yes, him."
513540, "Was anyone sick around here before he had come to the Termitary?"
513541, "Of course. Why would he come otherwise?"
513542, "Now that's news..."
513543, "I don't know. But it's terribly scary. They're very very angry with us. They want to get back at us. Let them stay where they are."
513544, "Why are they angry?"
513545, "Because we didn't feed them. But they locked themselves away on purpose! We didn't make them to! It's their own fault, not mine!"
513546, "Definitely not yours."
513547, "Is there anything I can do for you?"
513548, "...And what would happen to that person?"
513549, "Well, I want to ask him why he had us locked up-and then ask him some more."
513550, "The best I can do is let him know that you're looking for him."
513551, "It doesn't take a genius to see that you're going to kill him."
513552, "No. We're not going to kill him. We'll take him."
513553, "If you do what I'm asking of you, I'll open the passage to the Abattoir-for you."
513554, "I refuse."
513556, "That changes things. Wait here-I'll be back."
513557, "No. I need to get into the Abattoir, but not at the cost of someone's life-and I know that I would sentence that person to death were I to agree."
513558, "Hmm. Then perhaps you can bring me a toy?"
513559, "Now we're talking. That I can do easily. Which toy would you like?"
513560, "I don't have the time to be your errand boy."
513561, "I don't need just any toy. I need the toy-my Supreme Calf. I'll show you where the guys have left him."
513562, "Please be so kind."
513563, "I brought you the calf. Is this the one?"
513564, "Yeah. This is the one. Thank you."
513565, "Tell the butchers to let me in, please."
513566, "I will. You'll get the right of passage. Come back half an hour before midnight. The boulder will be rolled away."
513567, "All right."
513568, "I've delivered your message to Olgimsky the Younger. He promised to come."
513569, "He did come."
513570, "What have you done to him?"
513571, "We had him locked up for now. Fair's fair. He locked us up, now it's our turn. We'll see how it goes."
513572, "Tell the butchers to let me in, please."
513574, "Oh, so I'm 'not far off the mark', huh?"
513575, "I did indeed hide a certain crime I've committed. And I believe that something nasty was indeed dug up, and bred deadly bacteria. The only snag here is that those two insightful observations are not... connected in any fashion."
513576, "So you knew that the bacteria originates underground? And you never told me?"
513577, "I don't know anything for sure. Moreover, I've found nothing to support that theory. The earth in the well is clean. And the deeper I dig, the cleaner and denser it becomes. Pure sand and solid white clay."
513578, "But why didn't you tell me of your suspicions?"
513579, "Because if my theory proved to be correct, we would have had no choice but to raze the town's residential districts. Wipe out everything between the Abattoir and the Gorkhon."
513580, "Why in the world?"
513581, "Don’t lie to me, Vlad. I may not be a specialist in clay either, but I'm good enough at microbiology. The thing that's eating up your blood was born underground, in mineral deposits."
513582, "Over the years, the people have bored countless holes into the ground. All for naught: they always hit a layer of compacted clay. The town is full of those dead-end burrows, those underground creepholes. Who would ever believe that they all came to solid rock, like a prisoner's tunnel comes to a brick wall? "
513583, "That's not a good enough reason to give that order."
513584, "I can't peek inside your head, now can I? Perhaps you wouldn't issue that order. But the general, who's arriving here with his forces tomorrow, wouldn’t listen to you mumbling that it's nothing more than a theory. He'd just do it."
513585, "Perhaps you're not far from the truth. Can you swear to me that there was nothing in the well? On your family's honour?"
513586, "Yes. You can have a sample and analyze it if you will. A sample of sand and clay... If it's necessary, I can even call my people and have them dig it up again. But honestly... you're going to need a deeper hole than that."
513587, "No need for that. How can I get into the Abattoir?"
513588, "So this is the person who's responsible for turning the Termitary into a mass grave..."
513589, "Who told you that?"
513590, "Aspity."
513591, "That's not important. What's important is whether I'm going to relay that to the Inquisitor."
513592, "No use denying it now... I knew that the truth would come out when the Termitary is unlocked... I just hoped I would have time before that. No such luck, I suppose."
513593, "Have time for what?"
513594, "That bitch... It amazes me how she won't even demand anything! Everything she does, she does purely out of malice and spite!"
513595, "Tell me everything, Vlad. Your life is hanging by a thread."
513596, "Worse. It's not my life, it's my family's honour."
513597, "Start talking."
513598, "So you did your best to conceal this, huh... Perhaps you know more about the plague than you show either? What with this well of yours?"
513599, "I did indeed hide a certain crime I've committed. And I believe that something nasty was indeed dug up, and bred deadly bacteria. The only snag here is that those two insightful observations are not in any way connected."
513600, "I don't believe you."
513601, "Tough luck, doctor. I don't trust you. My confession wouldn't be of any use to you, but it could raise too much noise. You'll draw all the wrong conclusions... The consequences could be tragic, especially if the Inquistor and the Commander get involved."
513602, "If you value our relations, tell me what you were looking for underground."
513603, "They will, that much I can guarantee you."
513604, "We'll speak of this again."
513605, "Don't worry, I'll find a way to loosen your tongue."
513607, "I've come to relay an order issued by a little girl."
513608, "Not quite. One work is done, but another is only beginning."
513609, "Not this again! Why do you insist on being so vague? Now is not the time for insinuations! We're going to have a common enemy tomorrow."
513610, "What do you want from me?"
513611, "Cooperation."
513612, "Your work seems to be done."
513613, "That's just lovely... Are you talking about Murky?"
513614, "I have an ally already, and it's Artemy Burakh. He acts in our family's best interests. As for you, you are now the Inquisitor's most trusted man."
513615, "Are you implying that she doesn't trust Burakh?"
513616, "She doesn't. Burakh has unknowingly crossed her. In fact, if matters continue to develop as they are now, Burakh's actions are going to spell Aglaya's death sentence. Unless you interfere, of course."
513617, "I will, rest assured."
513618, "One more time I wish to prove to you that I'm your friend. Do not approach the Termitary. If you do, they'll tear you to pieces."
513619, "But... why?"
513620, "You know the answer perfectly well."
513621, "...Yes, I do. Who made the threat? Foreman Oyun?"
513622, "If you do, then don't approach the Termitary. And tell your family to do the same."
513623, "No. The daughter of commandant Tycheek. They call her the Mother Superior."
513624, "Yes... funnily enough, this is scarier than a full scale riot. She's a formidable opponent. And then there are my sister's games... Thank you, Bachelor!"
513625, "Don't mention it."
513626, "What games?"
513627, "My sister's affection for me has been dwindling, and she's come up with all sorts of schemes concerning Tycheek's little daughter... It seems the screw makes another turn. Oh, poor father! Was his sacrifice in vain?"
513628, "In any case, you have been warned."
513629, "No. One Taya Tycheek."
513630, "...Do orders come from beyond the grave now? Summonses even?"
513631, "You're not so far from the truth."
513632, "The only mistake here being that she's alive and well."
513633, "Impossible... Did they bring her up with their meat?"
513634, "Are you joking?"
513635, "She really wants to see the person who ordered the Termitary closed. As far as I understand, I'm not the only person she's asked for assistance with this matter. Burakh will probably ignore her request, but as for Clara..."
513636, "I don't know. I didn't go into that much detail."
513637, "Yes. I must go there immediately. If I don't, they'll kill my father. Please, warn him, tell him not to go to the Termitary under any circumstances! I shall go immediately. I must come to them before my father beats me to it."
513638, "That is very honourable of you. I'll warn your father and follow you as soon as I can. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to speak in your defense."
513641, "Aspity, say, do you by any chance know what Vlad the Younger was digging out?"
513642, "Ah, the leech won't crack! Thinks he's the smartest! And also he seems to think that he can get out of this deal and that well with his hands and name clean... But that's fine, I know how to make him talk all right."
513643, "How?"
513644, "It's simple. Just reveal to the world all those thousands of lifes that have perished in a few days because of him. And to think that I, a simple girl that I am, blamed the father... Shame. What a shame."
513645, "What are you talking about?"
513646, "It was he who ordered to close down the Termitary. He hid the truth from his father, blamed it all on some imaginary strike-he knew how to get to the old man, to make him mad, to make him damn everyone inside."
513647, "Wait... So he knew about the epidemic beforehand?"
513648, "Spot on."
513649, "But Big Vlad knew about the disease..."
513650, "He found out eventually, of course. Took the fall for the heir! He's done, he's old, he doesn't care about additional stains on his tired concience-whereas his son has a town yet to rule. And to be popular with. That's essential to ruling."
513651, "Didn't see that coming."
513652, "Has Vlad the Younger even had that kind of power?"
513653, "Yeah. On the other hand, he is a loyal son still, he wouldn't like to see his father's head roll... And oh, can the Mother make heads roll! Both of them will stick to that secret tooth and nail. I'd have a go on it myself, but that Changeling girl has a better idea."
513654, "Thank you, Aspity. That explains a lot."
513655, "Who told you that?"
513656, "Well, there were survivors in the Termitary, and they did get out. And the stories they tell-they make my blood run even colder than it naturally is..."
513657, "So there were more deaths than survivors?"
513658, "Stop with the swearing."
513659, ""
513660, "My path was long and hard..."
513661, "Is it true that you've covered for your son?"
513662, "What is this slanderous rubbish?"
513663, "I know everything. Drop the act."
513664, "Why on earth would I cover for him?"
513665, "It was he, not you, who'd locked up the Termitary-while fully aware of the epidemic. Wasn't it?"
513666, "My boy was absolutely in the right! Naturally, he was at a loss. His decision was too radical. He couldn't inform everyone because... it was just that kind of day. You lot came to crowd us when it was already too late. We knew by then that unlocking the Termitary would mean destroying the Town."
513667, "And yet you've decided to take the fall for him."
513668, "As if the fall was obligatory... His hand was forced. And then his mouth was shut... He had no choice. He cared for me... in his own way. He did exactly like I taught him. And so I did my best to care for him... when it was my turn."
513669, "The Mother Superior wants to see the man who has issued the order to lock up the Termitary."
513670, "You mean the little Tycheek girl?"
513671, "Yes."
513672, "Well, she's got every right to demand it. I'm not going to hide from her. He who has sinned must be able to face the music."
513673, "Go then. She's waiting for you."
513674, "Be strong."
513675, "The little girl surrounded by an army of butchers-who seem to be very eager to follow every word of hers."
513676, "What are you going to do now?"
513677, "I'm just telling you what I've heard from Aspity."
513678, "The foul demon... I had a feeling she will be the end of my kin... and so she has. A shaggy death came from the Steppe, just as was foretold by my dear wife... I suspect the evil wench wasn't merely... observing."
513679, "So it was Vlad the Younger who ordered to lock the Termitary, wasn't it?"
513680, "Yes, she sends shivers down my spine as well. But it's not her that is a menace to your son. It's not her you have protected him from..."
513681, "I'm responsible for everything. Since the day when I learned of his actions-from him personally, if I might add-I remain responsible for them."
513682, "Well, it's your choice."
513683, "I advise you steer clear of the Termitary."
513684, "Well... I've never been particularly eager to visit it. Why would I?"
513685, "It seems like its dwellers are all too eager to bring to account the person who's caused them so much harm."
513686, "Once again they see the root of all evil in me..."
513687, "I think there's no need for you to hurry."
513688, "The Abattoir hypothesis is already being worked on by someone else-a person who had somehow managed to infiltrate the place even before my arrival. You can try to follow in his steps, of course; that would make a lot of sense. But I wouldn't be in any hurry to do so, if I were you. Who knows what danger lies inside."
513689, "At least the Olgimskys will stop getting in my way."
513690, "Are you interested in the Abattoir because you believe that the pest might have been brought to the town by cattle?"
513691, "Yes."
513692, "No, I rather suspect the butchers; their line of trade has something to do with the soil. I think they may be doing some digging."
513693, "I'm curious as to what their waste dumping solution is."
513694, "Have you already checked water, specifically river water?"
513695, "No. No reason to; it's clean."
513696, "There is a suspicious spring around here, but people have been using it for a long time."
513697, "I've investigated the water hypothesis already, yes. Those frightened luddits have even destroyed the town water intake, which lead to a malfunction of the town water supply system. We've found ourselves in a world of trouble because of that."
513698, "How about we check this hypothesis thoroughly though? Before we get on with inspecting buildings, we need to make sure the disease was not water-borne. Wells, springs, the river... or maybe a young new stream. Anything."
513699, "All right. There is one suspicious well I'd like to check."
513700, "Still, I believe the disease came from the outside-but not via water, but rather carried by a person. Or an animal, perhaps."
513701, "No. The cause of the disease is the world itself."
513702, "We'll see."
513703, "Care to tell me more about the suspicious well?"
513704, "Young Vladislav Olgimsky has a rather peculiar hobby. I've been told that he's looking for old cultural layers, the remnants of an ancient culture or something. I've also been told that he's looking for oil. Neither explaination sounds convincing."
513705, "What kind of person is he?"
513706, "A trustworthy kind. I think."
513707, "Is this the reason why you two have managed to get on until now-without breaching the subject of the well?"
513708, "Yes."
513709, "I have other things to do."
513710, "Investigate this further! Ask him. If he refuses to talk... well, there are a number of ways to inspire social interaction. And no, I'm obviously not implying torture; it just may so happen that he suddendly gets in the mood to explain everything to you... He may need a fair hearing. To justify his actions. Do you understand?"
513711, "Sounds very much doable. I'll talk to him."
513712, "BEAST HEAD. Perhaps this used to be a toy horse. However, a closer look reveals horns growing out of the head. The horns arguably seem to go back to the bull cult."
513713, "LARA'S BLOOD. Lara Ravel's blood test."
513714, "YULIA'S BLOOD. Yulia Lyuricheva's blood test."
513715, "ASPITY'S BLOOD. Aspity's blood test."
513716, "ANNA'S BLOOD. Anna Angel's blood test."
513717, "CLARA'S BLOOD. Clara's blood test."
513718, "You know... I'm almost happy now, my dear Daniil... I've found a way to help you! But hush... for now it's a secret! "
513719, "You have a peculiar look in your eye, Eva, as though you were not quite yourself... Have some sleep. You must be exhausted... "
513720, "Yes? "
513721, "What's the news? "
513722, "I see you're not in the mood... "
513723, "Best of luck to you, my friend."
513724, "Farewell."
513725, "'They are going to burn the Termitary down'"
513726, "News of the Hunchback's demise would please Vlad the Younger a great deal. He will have no trouble buying himself out of any sensitive questioning. But that said, he will have to face a judge before long, and a judge would be much less lenient than I."
513727, "*** The assault has been called off. The Hunchback is dead. Of course, there is a sense of justice in it, since I am responsible for this whole incindiary spectacle. A small personal victory amongst all the chaos that has been wrought upon this town. Nonetheless, I am sure the Inquisitor will take it into account."
513728, "*** I failed to stop the exterminators. No man can do everything himself, can he? Tomorrow the Inquisitor will arrive and this task is more appropriate for him. I only hope that the Termitary won't be razed to the ground before then."
513729, "The exterminators-led by the desperate Hunchback-are conspiring to raze the infected Termitary. The assault will commence after dark. Vlad the Younger is hoping to prevent it, but his eyes betray some hidden intent. I need to talk to the older Olgimsky."
513730, "'The Thing from the Steppe'"
513731, "The Albino is dead. Should I tell Sticky about it? The mind boggles... Is this really the maneater Shabnak-Adyr, the spawn of the Steppe, crafted lovingly from bone and clay, by will and reason of an ancient chthon?"
513732, "*** Just as I thought. It was nothing but a mirage, a farewell memento from this bizarre place that is-beyond a shadow of a doubt-merely a respite on my way to the netherworld. Every time we think that we have accomplished what we sought, it turns out to be an illusion... Or am I the only one who suffers this?"
513733, "*** The steppe creature has slipped away. Somehow I get the feeling that meeting it would have changed nothing, one way or another."
513734, "'Witch-hunt'"
513735, "There is only one thing left to do; I must locate the cause of the outbreak. The unusual nature of contamination throughout the town, the rumours of the maneater, the tragedy at the cathedral-there is no shortage of evidence to support the 'carrier' hypothesis. No wonder Olgimsky has something to say on the matter..."
513736, "We have caught the bacteria. Now we know what the blood of an infected man looks like. We have learned what the Sand Plague does to its victims as it thrives within their bodies. The rulers have chosen to take advantage of these findings in order to reignite the witch-hunt. Only this time it is with the carrier instead of the maneater. I need to talk with Saburov about it."
513737, "There is a terrifying rumour spreading of the carrier in the Cathedral. It has put everyone into a state of trepidation. Saburov places the blame on Yulia and Lara. The experiment that Rubin and I conducted was a success. The truth should be easy to establish; we only need to test the blood."
513738, "Olgimsky is certain that both Anna and Aspity are guilty. Could it be avarice that drives his conclusion rather than common sense? Perhaps he is right, to an extent. Both women are indeed suspicious. I must examine their blood against the sample that we obtained yesterday. Everything will come to light then. "
513739, "So that's who the night-time visitor was! That's why Lara and Yulia's belongings were found in the Cathedral! That's who Alexander was trying to protect all along! And this extraordinary girl is the very person I would have started with. There's too much fervour in her-a fervour which was mistakenly thought to be of a sacred nature... I get the feeling that Clara's blood has a lot to tell."
513740, "I need to make another visit to the furthest entrance of the Abattoir. Perhaps I can find Clara there, weeping over the Albino's corpse. This is how it is. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
513741, "*** It is decided. Lara Ravel will have to stand before the Inquisitor. This is the sacrifice she herself has offered, I merely accepted it. My report is concluded. There is some comfort in thinking that my falsification was performed in the name of the greater good... But what kind of man does this make me? Tomorrow will tell."
513742, "*** I was unable to find the source. There is no carrier. My primary assumption has proved incorrect; the cornerstone of my theory has crumbled. What am I going to say to the Inquisitor tomorrow?"
513743, "*** It is decided. Yulia Lyuricheva will have to stand before the Inquisitor. This is the sacrifice she herself has offered, I merely accepted it. My report is concluded. There is some comfort in thinking that my falsification was performed in the name of the greater good... But what kind of man does this make me? Tomorrow will tell."
513744, "*** It is decided. Aspity will have to stand before the Inquisitor. This is the sacrifice she herself has offered, I merely accepted it. My report is concluded. There is some comfort in thinking that my falsification was performed in the name of the greater good... But what kind of man does this make me? Tomorrow will tell."
513745, "*** It is decided. Clara will have to stand before the Inquisitor. This is the sacrifice she herself has offered, I merely accepted it. My report is concluded. There is some comfort in thinking that my falsification was performed in the name of the greater good... But what kind of man does this make me? Tomorrow will tell."
513746, "Grace, the deranged daughter of the cemetery caretaker would know where Clara may be found."
513747, "Anna, your blood is clean. Any allegations in your regard were unsubstantiated."
513748, "See? See? Exactly, it's clean... Hey... did you by any chance find anything else in there? You know, there are all kinds of dreadful diseases... We actresses are delicate women. Anything may happen to us. Oh, the unexpected turns our frantic life can take... "
513749, "There's noting to worry about."
513750, "PETER STAMATIN'S BLUEPRINTS. Blueprints of the Polyhedron lined with tracing paper and containing a detailed description of the structure.

513756, "Tell the butchers to let me in, please."
513757, "I will. You'll get the right of passage. Come back half an hour before midnight. The boulder will be rolled away."
513758, "Good. This is good."

513764, "*** That crafty Burakh... No rest for the wicked! I wonder where he found a monster like this. I never saw a blood of this kind before. Is this the main ingredient for his panacea?"
513765, "*** I did not examine the blood in good time. It is too late now; it has changed."
513766, "Viсtoria sent these drugs to you. She said you must take them is you ever feel unwell."
513767, "Are you sure? It's not real medicine..."

513773, "*** The Termitary and the Polyhedron... These polarised structures stand at opposite ends of the town. They are antithetic of each other, regardless of your perspective. I failed to protect the Termitary and I have neglected the Tower of Children. I can only hope that it does not fall to the same mistake..."
513774, "*** I failed to pay sufficient attention to the affairs of the children."
513775, "So the Haruspex made his panacea after all! Good for him!"
513776, "I wouldn't be so sure yet."
513777, "You're so tired, Daniil... you're just not showing it. I see how exhausted you are..."
513778, "It's you who look exhausted, Maria. I am quite all right. "

513805, "What thing?"
513806, "Panacea. Today Burakh was going to perfect a remedy that would heal anyone sick with the Sand Pest, however grave their condition."
513807, "That sounds like some sort of folk medicine... dubious medicine."
513808, "Effective, still. Wasn't the vaccine you prepared with the local doctor also based on folk recipes? The approach is completely similar."
513809, "Fair enough."
513810, "It's not just about the panacea. Burakh is much more significant than many would care to admit... including himself, perhaps. Could you please inquire about him? I don't doubt his word, but he could have run into some unforseen danger because of his invention... Do you understand?"
513811, "I don't know if I can make it inside the Abattoir. Unless, perhaps, you provide me with military support."
513812, "Getting soldiers is not so simple. They won't listen to me and Block... who seems to have no intention to listen to me either.  But I am not asking you to descend into that underground pagan shrine. Just inquire about Burakh, if you have an opportunity."
513813, "That's not hard to do."
513814, "If I ever have an opportunity, I will."
513815, "I warned you of his inevitable betrayal!"
513816, "No. I don't think so. "
513817, "I do not like him. "
513818, "Power can take very different shapes..."
513819, "Are you talking about Block?"
513820, "I never imagined that he hated me so much. Why? What did I ever do to him? I was expecting some instinctive resentment as part of the age-long conflict between the military and the inquisition... but Block, it seems, would happily have my head on a platter."
513821, "What might be the reason?"
513822, "I wonder that myself. For a moment, I thought he was driven by the same feeling that I am: a great man, when unexpectedly betrayed by the people he loves, will often seek to fill the whole universe with his blind spite. Yes, the feeling is indeed familiar..."
513823, "Does he consider himself betrayed? "
513824, "Come now, Dankovsky... They threw us all in the fire, hoping that we burn to death while simultaneously putting the flame out with our very bodies. What I'm really wondering is whether the intention to destroy the town is the product of his own judgement-or comes from the Powers That Be."
513825, "Doesn't feel like their style."
513826, "I concur."
513827, "Can a commanding officer charged with a mission like this act on his own judgement?"
513828, "Block would. He has become full of himself, drunk on his own glory. I have no doubt that he already dreams of himself becoming head of the government or some sort of emergency committee; a consulate at the very least. Besides, who's to say he wasn't instructed to act according to the circumstance?"
513829, "Just like you and me-given the pro forma freedom to decide, but left with no choice in reality."
513830, "Don't you think a situation like this would be infuriating to a clever commander like him, who also has the troops' undying loyalty and armaments such as have been shown to us? Free to surround, to die-but never to fire..."
513831, "Could that really have been the actual order?"
513832, "I think so. A legitimate order to act in good conscience-complete with a sidenote suggesting that he have the last will ready before firing the big guns."
513833, "Then why send the army here at all?"
513834, "You know... just in case. In case of riots. In case of our defeat. In case both you and I announce that nothing can be saved, the battle cannot be won and a pandemic is inevitable... In this case, the Powers That Be would resort to drastic measures. This town is not their only toy, after all."
513835, "But we have won... "
513836, "Almost. "
513837, "Yes... Almost."
513838, "...Until you, Aglaya, declare that the town is saved. Understandably, he resents the situation-and extends his resentment to you."
513839, "He saved me yesterday. "
513840, "So I've heard. It would be rather ridiculous to deny his courage. Whatever he is, he is a master of his trade."
513841, "Quite."
513842, "That monstrosity they brought... They can't fire it here. I'm not sure they can fire it at all."
513843, "Why not? They surely can."
513844, "What, are they planning to lower the barrel parallel to the ground and fire horizontally at point-blank range?"
513845, "Of course not. That particular weapon was brought here for me personally... as an impressively high-scale persuasion method. The actual guns that are meant to bombard the town were left on the railroad span, some thirty kilometers away."
513846, "So we'll have some time while they're finding the range?"
513847, "A morbid joke. Once they take that big gun away, it's over. The bombardment begins a few hours after that."
513848, "I see."
513849, "Since when is our army fielding such monstrosities anyway?"
513850, "It's the latest breakthrough in artillery production. The military top brass' juvenile love of giant weapons. To an immature mind, size translates directly to power. Ironically, Block drafted his military reform to stop the construction of such beasts."
513851, "That's just lovely, isn't it."
513852, "But the power of knowledge will always find a way to trump the force of arms."
513853, "And I hope to demonstrate that to the military in no uncertain terms. With your kind assistance, of course."
513854, "How can I help you?"
513855, "First of all, you could collect detailed data on that peculiar structure. I mean the Polyhedron."
513856, "That was exactly my plan. Do not worry, I am already working on it."
513857, "But I'd rather like to start from the Abattoir."
513858, "After yesterday's incident I assigned a different person to work on the Abattoi: your mysterious colleague, Artemy Burakh. I have full faith in him."
513859, "I trust Burakh's honesty, but his principles and morals are alien to me."
513860, "He is a dangerous man!"
513861, "I have encountered many dangers in my life. I have found a way to deal with all of them. No need to worry."
513862, "He will deceive you. "
513863, "I cannot be deceived. "
513864, "Good."
513865, "My yesterday's visit to the Abattoir was unsuccessful."
513866, "Yes, I'm aware of that. Well, we're all making a gamble here. But Burakh has agreed to help me out. The residents of the Abattoir accept him as one of their own and aren't as hostile to him. I'd even go as fas as to say that he's on good terms with the people who manage the biorhythms of that stone belly."
513867, "Does he go there regularly? "
513868, "Yes, several times a day. We can learn everything we need from him."
513869, "But can his words be trusted?"
513870, "Absolutely. Both his words and his deeds."
513871, "Well, I'll trust your insight then."
513872, "I feel that you will come to regret placing your faith in him."
513873, "Oh, I'm almost certain he is to become my downfall. But we only need a few days to ensure our victory, and we're unlikely to have more anyway; for a few days we can act together in the interest of the common good. "
513874, "Surely you have your own plans."
513875, "I dare not argue."
513876, "Good. I have my own plans in that regard."
513877, "May I inquire as to what those are?"
513878, "It's a personal matter."
513879, "It concerns the origins of bacteria. You'll find out in due time."
513880, "Yes, can't argue with that."
513881, ""
513882, "I'm glad that you've made it, Bachelor Dankovsky."
513883, "What were you doing in the Abattoir?"
513884, "I was looking for you."
513885, "Is that so?"
513886, "Ex-governor Saburov told me where to look for you this night. I seek your advice. What have you discovered about the epidemic? Can it be stopped and what can the army do to that end?"
513887, "The Inquisitor... "
513888, "The Inquisitor is my enemy. Evidence mounts by the hour. I have no further desire to listen to my enemies. A dog should never trust a cat, fire should never trust water, and I, a battlefield general, will not trust inquisitors."
513889, "But why?"
513890, "Do you have any idea how many traps inquisitors spin into their webs? The truth will be beyond your wildest expectations. Well, I am not a puppet. I suspect, however, that I have already been made into one. I suspect that even the words I'm uttering now are merely a part of her calculations!"
513891, "I trust Aglaya Lilich."
513892, "Well, I am only going to trust you. And only until it becomes evident that you too have fallen under the witch's spell."
513893, "Your trust is moving."
513894, "I feel a fighting man in you. Someone who thinks before he strikes. Someone who takes responsibility for his blows. Who chose a worthy opponent and is capable of vanquishing it. We are two warriors-and it is our task to deal with the evil threatening to spread across the whole country from here."
513895, "Consider me to be your friend. "
513896, "I am doing my duty. No need to blow things out of proportion."
513897, "I think you're exaggerating. "
513898, "General, Aglaya Lilich is my ally. She has aided me no less than you have. I have no desire to be part of your conflict."
513899, "I never expected you to be so straightforward."
513900, "I don't want to be an arrogant fool who listens to no one, courtesy of a big gun like the one I have on the sidelines near the station. You are an expert. I want to hear your expert take on the current state of affairs."
513901, "Plenty of better experts around."
513902, "I doubt it. "
513903, "Do not overestimate my significance."
513904, "The situation is out of my hands now."
513905, "I was looking for you too."
513906, "I need a few rifles."
513907, "What for? "
513908, "Personal needs."
513909, "No, I do not understand. What kind of needs?"
513910, "Don't you trust me? "
513911, "Perhaps I could make an exception and issue firearms to a civilian, but in order to do so I need to know exactly what they are going to be used for."
513912, "Self-defense."
513913, "For self-defense I am willing, out of deepest respect, to issue one rifle and three clips to you personally."
513914, "May I have two rifles?"
513915, "Are you hiding something from me?"
513916, "No. "
513917, "In any case, I can't do two."
513918, "That is a pity."
513919, "Thank you. That's generous of you."
513920, "For the boys. They're asking for rifles."
513921, "Do not joke like that again, Bachelor Dankovsky."
513922, "But I'm not joking!"
513923, "Enough. Let us not return to this subject again."
513924, "Tell me, Alexander-what are your intentions concerning the Polyhedron? "
513925, "That terrible structure on the other side of the river? "
513926, "Yes. "
513927, "How does it even stand upright?"
513928, "That's what I'm trying to find out at the moment."
513929, "And what's inside?"
513930, "A thousand children, give or take. They are hiding from the infection."
513931, "And who is looking after these children? "
513932, "That's the point-no one is. They might try all sorts of tricks."
513933, "If they try anything massive and disruptive to the public order, we'll have to subdue them by force. Don't worry, no one is going to shoot them. But you have to agree that the rascals deserve something more persuasive than a simple spanking."
513934, "I'll try to keep them from doing anything rash."
513935, "Why did you bring the subject up?"
513936, "I wanted to ask two things of you. First, do not disturb them with your attention. Leave that to me. And second, should they try anything stupid..."
513937, "Such as?"
513938, "I don't know. If you hear strange sounds from that direction, or if they send messengers... anything! Just consult me first. I'm staying here until the end."
513939, "Very well. You have my word."
513940, "Thank you."
513941, "They're managing perfectly well by themselves."
513942, "Well, if they're managing perfectly well, less trouble for us. Do they never leave that thing?"
513943, "No. And let no one inside. "
513944, "An independent state, and an extremely aggressive one at that. All its citizens are children."
513945, "Made possible by an ingenious architectural solution, I suppose. I am not yet sure."
513946, "Terrible? Don't you like it?"
513947, "It's not like I had a choice."
513948, ""
513949, "It's nice to see that you've survived, oynon. "
513950, "Aglaya Lilich has lost track of you. She asked me to tell you she was worried."
513951, "I have nothing to offer her for now. Tell her that I have descended underground. I've met with Foreman Oyun. So far he refuses to tell me what I want to hear. I don't like his riddles and half-truths. I have a suspicion that he's a villain."
513952, "Are you going to go there again?"
513953, "Yes. Of course. Through that abyss lies my only way back."
513954, "Can you find something out for me? This is very important because, obviously, I won't ever get inside."
513955, "Do you need that to beat the epidemic? They told me that was the reason you went underground yesterday."
513956, "A friend told me that the Abattoir has underground passageways which could explain the origin of the disease."
513957, "Now that is curious... underground passageways?"
513958, "Yes. I am convinced that the bacteria originated underground. In the soil."
513959, "If that is so, then it's very bad."
513960, "Why? "
513961, "This means the disease is dissolved in the ground? Everywhere, under our feet? "
513962, "No. Vlad the Younger claims otherwise. I suspect that there is a sort of shaft or cavern under one of the buildings here... some spot where this filth has built up."
513963, "I see. I'll find out what I can, oynon. Your words have guided me to an interesting idea..."
513964, "I hope to see you shortly. "
513977, "Yesterday they attacked me like wild beasts... "
513978, "They are wild beasts. Be careful with butchers, Bachelor. Life around here is different. A single person means nothing, not by himself. You aren't worth a kopeck if you are estranged from the whole."
513979, "I'll keep that in mind."
513980, "It really is. "
513993, ""
513994, "There you are, Bachelor Dankosvky. You see, I wanted to avoid all the unnecessary sentimental talk... But it has come to be that the Kains are getting ready to sleep. And it will come to be that only Maria will rise from that sleep. If you leave us, we will probably perish."
513995, "Is it that unacceptable?"
513996, "Why, not only are there a thousand children taking refuge there, Bachelor, but the Tower itself is a creation of such singular value that I would sacrifice everything to save it; and many in the town, including our enemies, would stand by me. Yes. It is unacceptable."
513997, "Doesn't sound too convincing."
513998, "The Polyhedron conceals a secret. It is unknown whether it came to be by accident or as part of some ingenious design, but it works. I don't know if it will be revealed to you. I would like you to go inside and convince yourself of the truth of my words."
513999, "That is my desire as well."
514000, "And if you succeed in gaining little Kaspar's confidence, I ask you do one last farewell favour for our family. Help me make peace with my son. Convince him to listen to me."
514001, "And what do you want him to do?"
514002, "When the time comes, and it will come in as little as two days now, the children must leave the Polyhedron. Otherwise, my daughter Maria could die. And my and Georgiy's passing... would also be in vain."
514003, "Why would Maria die?"
514004, "Because she will then be forced to become my successor. To take up what I currently guard and thus condemn herself to death, and our family to extinction. Maria will die-and the wondrous spirit whose memory we have so carefully passed on, will vanish into nothingness."
514005, "I don't understand."
514006, "Do you believe that it's possible to manipulate reincarnation?"
514007, "No."
514008, "Not only do we believe in it, but we have successfully practiced it for five generations. Don't ask me about the details-that would be too naïve and beside the point... I beg of you-convince Kaspar to open the Polyhedron to us when the time comes."
514009, "I will try. It is my long-time wish to get inside the Polyhedron."
514010, "Yes. I believe you. I will do as you ask."
514011, "What news do you bring?"
514012, "Tell me more about why you need the Polyhedron vacated."
514013, "Right now it's an optics-based fairground attraction, akin to a hot air balloon turned into an intricate playground by foolish children unaware of its true potential. It is time to give it the place for which it was intended."
514014, "And that would be?"
514015, "It's a trap, if you will. A reverberation of mirrors endlessly reflecting the visage of a lost soul. A great soul, Bachelor. A soul able to encompass the entire world. It's the perfect environment to house a spirit which has lost its physical shell. Where it can live and create."
514016, "Create?"
514017, "The difference between the spirit and the mind lies in the fact that the spirit's creativity requires no outside aids. No tools, no signs, no language. It simply exists-and the glory of its existence spreads upon those who would commune with it."
514018, "That's blasphemy."
514019, "That sounds naïve to me. But clearly you don't literally mean what you're saying."
514020, "On the contrary, that is exactly what I mean."
514021, "Then I'm not in a position to judge how close your theories are to the truth."
514022, "What I deem to be the truth is what I have been able to consistently observe. And if what I observe is so uncanny that it could be considered a result of a mental or spiritual illness, I turn to others to vindicate me."
514023, "I didn't mean to offend you with my disbelief."
514024, "And where would the children play then?"
514025, "It seems that Peter Stamatin has dreamed up a peculiar sort of fortress for them. Although I don't know if we have the capabilities now to construct it... Or the space. More importantly, I don't know whether we would be allowed to. Now that there is an Inquisitor here, we are no longer free."
514026, "We can't just throw the children out into an infected town."
514027, "Of course. But the Inquisitor has assured me that you have found the path to victory. She needs only to put your plan to practice. It seems there is not much left to do-just to find the source, am I right?"
514028, "Yes. It believe it's one of the buildings in the town."
514029, "Your son intends to make war. He is willing to let me inside, but he is asking for some army rifles."
514030, "He will acquire them, with or without your aid. If you don't help him, your counterparts will. Or someone else. Bring him what he asks but make him promise not to use the weapons and not to reveal them to the soldiers until they attempt to climb the Tower."
514031, "And will they make such an attempt?"
514032, "I think they won't. What reason do they have? But it would be better to warn Alexander Block, just in case. Incidentally, have you already talked to him?"
514033, "Yes."
514034, "What kind of impression did he leave on you?"
514035, "A clever strategist. He knows more than he lets on."
514036, "He is a noble and valiant warrior. I believe that he's trying to emulate epic heroes or ancient military leaders."
514037, "A terrifying man. A dangerous adversary. It's better not to make enemies of people like him."
514038, "No. I'll talk to him as soon as I have the time."
514039, "Bad as usual."

514044, "I'm ready to hear you out."
514045, "We need weapons."
514046, "Artillery, I presume?"
514047, "Kindly spare me your sarcasm. I need several military rifles-ammo included, obviously. I've been told they are long-range and very precise. "
514048, "May I inquire as to why you need them?"
514049, "Aglaya is closely in touch with Block, isn't she?"
514050, "Quite possibly."
514051, "If Block finds out there are more than a thousand of us in here, he'll think twice before storming the place. If he finds out we're armed... It will only take a couple of shots to convince him... wouldn't you agree?"
514052, "You're going to bluff, aren't you?"
514053, "I am. If you get us the rifles, we'll let you into the Polyhedron. Actually, kick it up a notch: we'll show you the boon that fate has granted us in detail."
514054, "Sounds tempting... Well, I've processed your request. I'll be back with news."
514055, "No. As far as I understand, they hate each other. So far each of them's been pretending the other doesn't exist at all."
514056, "Well, Block has to be communicating with someone, right? Has he been told as to how many children are here in the Polyhedron?"
514057, "If you insist, I can actually mention it to him when I get a chance. Just so that you know."
514058, "Oh! So the two of you are on equal terms?"
514059, "No, I wouldn't say so. "
514060, "Are you planning to fend off Alexander Block's soldiers with a couple of rifles?"
514061, "Obviously not-I do have a shred of sense left in me. I am not going to fight the man who had stormed the Skerries with only nineteen casualties on his side."
514062, "What's your plan then?"
514063, "What is my sister up to... Would she really try to remove us from here?"
514064, "No, of course not. She wouldn't go so far."
514067, "Didn't work out. Too bad."
514068, "I've brought the guns you've asked for, Khan. But they come with a condition."
514069, "Five rifles is too many to ask, Khan. Will you perhaps be satisfied with what I have on me right now?"
514070, "The deal was five. I've made the calculations; we wouldn't be able to maintain defence with less resources. Can't you just snatch them from the guards? The soldiers that are watching the weapon and cordoning off the place have relaxed their guard completely."
514071, "If all guardsmen are idiots, you're in a romantic novel. That's not how real life works."

514092, "The men on which the entire existence of the settlement depends had to face a very unpleasant discovery: the town was entirely unprepared for the calamity that has befallen it. Their attempts to fight the disease are greatly complicated by the lack of a hospital or an isolation ward, and even by the shortage of cemetery space. Because of that, the buildings most precious to the townspeople have had to be repurposed: the Cathedral became an isolation ward and the Theatre was made into a hospital. To address the issue of too many dead bodies, a town morgue was established in a huge warehouse previously used to store meat./n/nCome to the Theatre, without delay!

To catch the killer microbe red-handed, they first had to find a sick person from whom to extract a still beating heart. The sacrifice had to be made-but was this too high a price to pay for a discovery of such eminence?

514096, "Meanwhile, the hunt for the maneater is gaining momentum. Bacteria is a cute idea, but who could resist the opportunity to place the blame on someone more tangible? There must be a guilty party! After all, scientific evidence suggests that outbreaks like this are always caused by someone who has contracted the sickness before the rest. Were we to expose the maneater today, the town would have been spared the punitive measures that the Inquisitor is so eager to unleash upon it. Alas, the investigation was a failure.

She does not act in line with what one would normally expect an Inquisitor to do, but her determination hints at some furtive game she is playing. Are her purposes and goals that different from the ones that the Powers expect her to achieve?

514100, "The Inquisitor has started her inspection of the town. She works on a wide scale, ignoring the people-the ruling families inclusive-as something entirely useless to her. She studies the history of the settlement in-depth, she scrutinises maps and numbers, she reads through the tales and legends popular in these lands. It is almost as if her suspects were the buildings, the river, the celestial bodies and the bowels of the earth. Could the pestilence have been caused by the world's very nature, and not the human population of this place? This is definitely not what a true Inquisitor would assume!

514102, "The drama is approaching climax. Someone has come to put out the lights and vacate the premises. Who are they? They are the artillery detachments, firing squads, and flamethrower brigades led by General Ashes. Admittedly, they were so kind as to give the townspeople three days to put their affairs in order. Still, there is hardly any discussion as to who is in control of the situation. In three days, the army will use heavy artillery to level the town./n/nCome to the Theatre, without delay!

514104, "It has transpired that the pathologic construction that hangs in the air across the river was a shell concealing complex machinery. It is capable of creating mirages and visions by means of communicating mirrors whose motion governs the intricate interdependence of optical and kinetic illusions. The whole mechanism is possible because the architects of the building have succeded in resolving the contradiction between the celestial and the earthly. The sphere does not seem to be supported by any kind of foundation, rather it is reminiscent of a flower whose bulk is carried by a disproportionately fragile stem. Perhaps, the stairway upon which the building rests is not a structural support, but instead an anchor to hold this floating structure to the earth in the way of a stepladder thrown from a dirigible?/n/nCome to the Theatre, without delay!

The very soil on which the town is built is seeping with poison. The cause of the outbreak is clear now; it is a systematic certainty. Does this mean, however, that we must destroy the Tower? This dying town is already beyond salvation, but the Polyhedron-this epitome of human aspiration-may be saved. This fragile Mirror Tower rising high above the ground is you, Bachelor!

514194, "I have studied the blueprints of the specular edifice. It's a very suspicious building, let me tell you. It's actually not a building at all-it's a machine. The only thing I cannot understand is how it is mounted. Its nature disallows it from being fixed in place; it works like a gyro."
514195, "Indeed. A very spot-on description."
514196, "What do you think about it? "
514197, "I appreciate it. It's a brilliant monument to the aspiration of the human mind. "
514198, "I feel that the cause of the epidemic has something to do with it. I don't like the fact that solid ground supports a construction like this despite the law of gravity. I want to know how they managed to mount it. By answering that question we will found out where the plague came from."
514199, "Perhaps."
514200, "You spoke to the author of this creation yesterday, didn't you? "
514201, "Yes, I did. "
514202, "So find a way to torture him into telling you how they did it. "
514203, "All right, I will. But I don't think Peter was the one to mount the construction; I think Andrey was."
514204, "It could have been the Pope for all I care! It doesn't matter. I need the facts-the facts only. Something we can attach to the rest of the documents and show to the Commander. I don't see the blueprints of the foundation here. Do find them for all that's holy."
514205, "I doubt the Polyhedron is the cause.  "
514206, "I am not positive it has caused the epidemic. It's just my presumption. But you cannot deny that disregarding this presumption would be an act of criminal negligence."
514207, "Fine. I'll try to find the mind behind the blueprints. "
514208, "Fine. "
514209, "Torture is your job, Inquisitor. "
514210, "Not this time, Bachelor. I have my reasons for that, but I will not disclose them."
514211, "Well. I will do as you ask. Even though the construction wasn't mounted by Peter, but rather by his twin brother."
514212, "Are you sure? I have no doubt the Polyhedron has nothing to do with the epidemic. It's a masterpiece."
514213, "So what? It is indeed a masterpiece. It is entirely possible that humankind won't ever create anything to rival it. It's more than a masterpiece-it's a revolution. This construction is no less a breakthrough than starflight. "
514214, "I believe they're incompatible, this edifice and the plague. The Polyhedron has been reliably protecting everyone who tried to hide inside from the epidemic."
514215, "Trust my guts, Bachelor. I want to know the truth. "
514216, "So do I, believe me."
514217, "I just have a gut feeling."
514218, "I feel slightly envious. Like me, its creator has tried to break through to where men are not allowed. But, unlike me, he succeeded."
514219, "I think it's where the pest is spreading from."
514220, "I completely agree. A strange construction, a strange plague... If so many strange things seem to crowd so eagerly, it's only natural to assume they have the same source."
514221, "I agree. "
514222, "There's little to no time left."
514223, "Well... Do have a look... I've got the blueprint of the foundation. Here it is. Take a look."
514224, "So the miraculous machine turned out to be a lever pumping poisonous organic matter from below the ground? How symbolic. There is a certain familiar logic to it... the general logic of the world structure. Don't tell me you're surprised, Bachelor."
514225, "Why are you calling it a lever? "
514226, "So the local diggers, drillers, and engineers find sophisticated ways to screw a longest stem into the ground under Andrey Stamatin's guidance. The polyhedral egg lies upon this stem as though it was a spring. Reminds you of a lever, doesn't it?"
514227, "But if the builders stirred the underground deposits when they installed the foundation, why has the outbreak only happened now?"
514228, "Because of the soil. I think this clot used to be a pit where the Steppe people would bury the remains of slaughtered bulls. There are facts to support this. I suspect it was situated above the cramp's point. The pressure was gradually increasing. Perhaps the pintle was shifting. And when it got to the clot... "
514229, "Yes. Sound plausible."
514230, "We have found the source. I congratulate you on the victory, Daniil. Tomorrow is the last-and the hardest day. "
514231, "I congratulate you too. It's our common victory. "
514232, "See you at the meeting at the Headquarters tomorrow."
514233, "I'll come. "
514234, "There is a mutiny. Two companies have gone rogue. They're trying to get to the long-range weapons now."
514235, "I know that already. This is really too much..."
514236, "Block ia hunting them and punishing them mercilessly."
514237, "Yes, he's good at that... The worst is the fact that dissent is shortening our timeframe-and it's already short. We need to be swift. Any minute now Block will realize that every hour of delay is biting off a quarter of his forces."
514238, "We'll do everything we need to by tomorrow."
514239, "We may not make it."
514240, ""
514241, "Hey! You haven't abandoned me, old boy! I wasn't expecting you to come, to be honest... See, I was stupid enough to return here... But you probably know already that the soldiers are at each others' throats. The squads that are loyal to the general are killling the mutineers by the cannon-and the latter are quite displeased with me!"
514242, "Tell me what happened. Start from the beginning."
514243, "So, yesterday I came to my brother to sit by his side-as I was planning to. And there these war mongrels were... when I saw them, I knew our cake was dough. I had them removed from my brother's place and ran off looking for him. I kept searching all night, but he was nowhere to be seen. I even went to the general... and he told me there's a mutiny!"
514249, "You know, it's so peculiar that you're only asking about it now... In fact all these days I've been waiting for you to finally become interested in the foundation of the miracle! Weren't you surprised in the slightest? It would be easier to show you though... I'd have supported my words with documents if Peter hadn't burned the blueprints."
514250, "I saw them. But his designs only show the optical structure of the internal sphere. What I want to know is how the thin base can support it. As far as I understood, the main trick that enables the whole construction is that the main compartment doesn't touch the ground at all."
514251, "Indeed. So you got it! Tell me... do you like it? "
514252, "Yes. It's amazing. I've never seen anything like that. "
514253, "Right! And you never will! Peter has created this edifice by mistake. Yes, it's eighty percent his genius, but the other twenty it owes to a weird, ridiculously lucky combination of coincidences! But I have installed it without relying on sheer luck, oh no! It had to do with bold design, angry passion, and precise calculations.  "
514254, "...How have you installed it? This question has been driving me mad for more than a week now."
514258, "So? "
514259, "I don't get a thing. These are the designs of some spring. Amplitudes, angles, oscillation... fifty pages of calculations... What is this?"
514260, "What is there not to get? It's a steel-woven spring buried underground. A gigantic stem. Five and a half meters in diameter. More than three hundred meters long. That's some scale, huh?"
514261, "How did you manage to screw this monster into the ground?"
514262, "Oooh... We dug a trench. The riverbed was dry at that time. It was an insane idea. But the Kains asked Vlad to summon up the Kin, and he did. This collective construction has been worked on by the whole Termitary. We laid the pintle down gradually-and we dug its very sting underground at an acute angle."
514263, "Tell me, Andrey, did you find anything when digging the trench?"
514264, "Like what?"
514265, "Like an organic clot? Any unusual minerals or rot?"
514266, "No. Even I was surprised. There were only lifeless soil, firm clay, and sandstone. "
514267, "This cannot be... I don't believe this. "
514268, "At an acute angle? How deep did it reach?"
514269, "As deep as anyone has ever reached. We abused nature, there's no denying that. But it was worth it, as you can see."
514270, "Now I understand completely."
514278, "This is really something, old boy..."
514279, ""
514280, "So? "
514281, "Did you put Andrey Stamatin, the architect, in front of a firing squad?"
514282, "I've never heard of this person before. And no, I never gave such an order. Tell me more."
514283, "I was informed that your soldiers took away Andrey Stamatin, an architect, to shoot him. But he must not be shot."
514284, "Listen here.  Any orders given here are given by me. And I gave no such order. If a soldier claims I did, then they are a mutinee and subject to a court martial. I will begin the investigation of this incident immediately."
514285, "Where could he have been taken? "
514286, "I have no idea. I will gather the commanders immediately to find out who could have given out this order. We cannot exclude the possibility that it were the mutineers."
514287, "While you interrogate the officers, Andrey will die! "
514288, "What do you want from me? Do you want me to rush headlong searching for your friend in every nook and cranny? I doubt the result would be anything but negligible. Finding out who gave out the order would be immensely more effective. Unless a bunch of scoundrels acted on their own volition, of course..."
514289, "All right, I get your point."
514290, "He was taken to the railway. I request reinforcements to set him free."
514291, "I just was by the weapon. It's patrolled by the 8th Company. These are loyal men. Although... there has indeed been suspicious activity. So what you're saying is the soldiers took your friend claiming to have done so on my orders?"
514292, "Yes. "
514293, "Where did you get this information?"
514294, "The witnesses of the arrest have told me."
514295, "Fine. I'll summon the company commander and have him report the situation. If your friend was caught red-handed or arrested duly and according to the instructions, he will be brought to me. If the bastards are abusing their authority, we will arrest them."
514296, "It might be too late. "
514297, "I'm sorry to hear that, but I have no right to remove the soldiers from their posts. There is tension. Be patient-or just go there yourself. If you see an execution being prepared for, tell captain Longin that he is to cease unauthorized activity and wait for me."
514298, "Fine."
514299, "What suspicious activity? "
514300, "Answer the question, Bachelor. "
514301, "Yes. "
514302, "Not before you answer mine."
514303, "Stop with the nonsense. You are not my subordinate, but this is not the moment to waste time on such rubbish. Please be so kind as to follow the chain of command. "
514304, "Yes, it was like you said."
514305, "Go to hell. "
514306, "Listen! Your soldiers opened fire at me!"
514307, "I am already aware of that. You were absolutely in the right. I thank you."
514308, "Excuse me? "
514309, "Enough, this cannot go on any longer! My units are not following orders. Yesterday a quarter of them succumbed to the disease, today I lost a half more! The only good thing is that the plague mows the mutineers down faster than it does the loyal soldiers. Fitting spoils of their rebellion."
514310, "What units are these? "
514311, "The 15th Company. The flamethrower corps. The 42th infantry batallion-partially... The new raw troops. Transferred under me on a railway haul. Specifically for this damned mission!"
514312, "Do they have insignia or other distinctive features?"
514313, "Who needs insignia?! If the soldier's off his post, he's a criminal. Criminals are subject to a quick trial and immediate punishment. This is absolutely obvious. Now is not the time to take a soft line."
514314, "What should I do if I see a soldier off the post?"
514315, "Kill them on the spot. Offer resistance. Report to me. Although I'm already on it... if only I had enough forces left, the mutineers and traitors would have already been exterminated publicly-just like at the Karstov Fords!"
514316, "Fine. I'll keep it in mind."
514317, "Have these children come to you with a request? "
514318, "Yes. The mutinous bastards in military uniforms have taken their relatives somewhere to execute. They've come to beg me to cancel the execution order."
514319, "I hope you did? "
514320, "I never gave the order! All orders which are given to the soldiers without my approval are mutinous! Damn it... What an example they are setting for the rest... The last thing we want is for the weapon crew to become disobedient... These units are also raw. As for the mutineers, we'll punish them harshly."
514321, "How exactly? "
514322, "Any soldier encountered anywhere but where I placed him is a mutineer. They are subject to a court martial. Resist their actions-your reputation will only go up."
514323, "Would you allow me to deal with this unfirtunate case? "
514324, "We wait for tomorrow. "
514325, ""
514326, "I've got good news and bad news for you, oynon."
514327, "I'm listening. "
514328, "You asked me to find out the exact location of the underground clot from which the Sand Pest bacteria could have gotten onto the surface..."
514329, "I did! Have you succeeded?"
514330, "Uh-huh. The thing is, it's everywhere. The deposits are sprawling beneath the whole town like kraken tentacles; they originate in the old cattle husbandry places on the other side of the Gorkhon. The ground is soaked in it."
514331, "...What's the good news then? "
514332, "The good news is that the deposits lie very deep. They're covered by so many layers of solid soil that no borewell could ever reach them. An extremely deep hole would have to be drilled to puncture those clots and spill their contents into the ground waters."
514333, "An extremely deep hole? "
514334, "Yes. I doubt that drilling a hole like that is humanly possible."
514335, "Say, Burakh-if there were a madman that would punch through all those layers, what would happen then?"
514336, "Then the poison would gradually spread over the left bank of the Gorkhon. It would soak the ground around us in itself like milk soaks bread."
514337, "And why do you think that hasn't happened already?"
514338, "I have other things on my mind now, oynon. Playing safe is pointless. I'm only thinking about mitigating the consequences of the disaster. I want the Sand Pest to be no more a threat to the local population than chicken pox is."
514339, "Yes, I see. Nevertheless, if it has already happened, the town will have to be destroyed. We cannot allow anyone to keep living here."
514340, "Wait, oynon! Do not give out hasty orders. I swear to you, by tomorrow morning I'll find a way to produce so much medicine for the disease that there won't be a need to destroy it."
514341, "By tomorrow morning? "
514342, "Yes. But only if the people that need to be saved are alive. I've told you about them, remember? The kids that'll build a new town here in ten years-a town even more beautiful than the current one."
514343, "I'll think about."
514344, "Damn it... How did you find this out, Burakh? "
514345, "Well, that is unchecked, of course. But the Foreman of the butchers immediately knew what I was talking about. He said the deposits do exist. He drew the map of them sprawling underground."
514346, "Where did they come from?"
514347, "It's a secret, oynon. I cannot reveal it to you. "
514348, "Doesn't matter-it's obvious anyway. Ancient cattle burial grounds. You said you had more news?"
514349, ""
514350, "And now I want you to forget everything that you have ever been told about me. Trust me. Look me in the eye! Or look down-or else you may think that I'm trying to mesmerize you and impose my line of thinking upon you! Aglaya is a traitor. She is the main foe on your victory road."
514351, "You liar. Aglaya is my best friend and the most reliable ally I have. It was she who opened my eyes to the cunning deceit of the Powers That Be. I have wintessed her rightness firsthand."
514352, "She's telling lies. I've just found out that she doesn't want to find the source and defeat the disease at all. She's not counting on victory. She's not trying to find a way to perserve the town in its true form! Her inquisitorial mission is just a smokescreen, a performance!"
514353, "What does she want then?"
514354, "Only one thing: to destroy the children's Tower. Before she dies. As her final word. And she has chosen you to become her tool. Do you know that these tools are called rams?"
514355, "'Before she dies'?"
514356, "She is doomed. Sentenced to death. Her commission here was her last chance-she had to find a way to save the infected. But her job was done by the Ripper, Artemy Burakh. Yesterday she received a letter. The Powers That Be do not acknowledge that she's fulfilled her mission. She will be executed as soon as she gets back."
514357, "Why would she target the Polyhedron then? She's doomed anyway..."
514358, "Because of hatred. Aglaya sees the Polyhedron as Nina Kaina's infernal gift. She thinks that Nina rose high, but her pride drew down the wrath of heavens. Aglaya believes that her duty is to destroy this challenge before it has lead to more evil. Or maybe she doesn't even believe that..."
514359, "But what does Nina have to do with her?"
514360, "Nina Kaina is her sister. Didn't you know? She used to be Nina Lilich before marrying Victor."
514361, "So is this a display of family sentiments? "
514362, "She desperately, hopelessly abhors her sister. Even stronger than her worst enemy. When I got to uncover this secret and looked into her soul, my hair stood on end! Aglaya believes her sister to be the devil himself, a deathbringer. And you've been a mere tool for her."
514363, "...How so? "
514364, "It's all very simple. The army came. The Inquisitor-halfway to the scaffold already-has no power over the cannons. So she made you convince the Commander-for General Ashes does not believe her one bit. But you will offer him a false report with a clear heart and point in the wrong direction."
514365, "...I need proof. "
514366, "If the people I've asked you about are alive by tomorrow, tomorrow you'll have proof."
514367, "Amen to that."
514368, ""
514369, "And my Andrey... Rumour has it he's in danger? "
514370, "Is he the only one who has the blueprints of the Tower's foundation?"
514371, "He is. Or perhaps he no longer has them either."
514372, "Could somebody else have them too? Isn't there a copy in your family archive? Do you know that your uncle has granted me access to it?"
514373, "I need my Andrey! Even if there were a copy in our archive, you wouldn't get the blueprints now! But if you help Andrey out, you'll see a different meaning to the lines and figures on those blueprints. And I will reward you-if that means anything at all to you, of course."
514374, "All right. I'll help Andrey out."
514375, "Aglaya will sort it all out. And you're right, it doesn't mean anything anymore."
514376, "If he is, I'll drag him out of it. "
514377, "Everything will be decided tomorrow. The black muzzles of the cannons ready to begin the bombardment... so this is what the dark void of death looks like. So the true Nothingness, unlike true magic, can indeed be firmly grasped-with a steel ring, and one of a not particularly large calibre at that!"
514378, "Andrey is safe-as safe as humanly possible, anyway. "
514379, "My gratitude will not be long in showing. Tomorrow I'll show you how thankful I can be."
514380, "Tomorrow? "
514381, "Tomorrow the universe will be transformed once again! We shall destroy the pest's hotbed-thanks to you. If you make a miracle happen, and we manage to keep the Polyhedron out of harm's way-oh, what miracles we'll be able to perform... What powers will be at our disposal!"
514382, "What are you talking about? "
514383, "Without even knowing it, you will help several people-including Simon-achieve immortality with your victory. Yes, the very Simon whose passing has spelt the beginning of the end for us. But we will bring him back from oblivion! The town will live if Simon lives."
514384, "Please tell me how you're going to save his life."
514385, "You will see everything tomorrow. But I'm begging you-don't let them strike at the Polyhedron."
514386, "Impossible. I really regret to tell you this, but the Polyhedron is the true cause of the outbreak. "
514387, "This cannot be! "
514388, "Yes it can. It is proven. Andrey has provided the missing link. "
514389, "How is it possible? "
514390, "The Polyhedron's base disturbs the poison under the town and drives it upwards. "
514391, "And the destruction of the Polyhedron will stop the epidemic? "
514392, "Possibly. "
514393, "Daniil Dankovsky, please, don't make a last-minute mistake! It seems to me that Aglaya Lilich only wants one thing, and that's to destroy the Tower. I think she's only come here to do that-not to stop the epidemic."
514394, "But what for? "
514395, "I do not know. But she hates it direly. While hiding that hatred for some reason."
514396, "Curious... "
514397, "A good question... It's not certain."
514398, "Don't worry. We'll protect the Polyhedron at any cost. "
514399, "We'll see. "
514419, "That's deep."
514420, ""
514421, "They took Andrey away! The bold chairman of our feast! We could do nothing. They threatened us with guns and even killed two of us."
514422, "Who took him? "
514423, "The soldiers! We were resisting them for almost an hour, but they have broken in and turned everything here upside down."
514424, "Why did it happen? "
514425, "Yesterday Andrey attacked a patrol while trying to protect his brother. He disarmed the soldiers and killed an officer. Today they came to take revenge on him. "
514426, "Where did they take him? "
514427, "I've heard one of them say that they'd take him to the railway dead end. I think they'll lock our Stamatin in one of the carriages... and then shoot him! He's at the railway dead end-look for him there."
514428, "That's a precise description if I've ever heard one... what is this railway dead end?"
514429, "Well, I don't know for sure which of the lines is a dead end there! Do I look like a towerwoman? I think that's what they call the line that the military train came by... What, am I wrong?"
514430, "When was he taken away? "
514431, "Oh! A moment ago. Or rather half an hour, no more..."
514432, "I'll try to do something. "
514433, "There are too many soldiers there! There were more than a dozen of them here-and there must be even more there. You won't make it..."
514434, "I'm not going to fight them. I'll report this to the Commander immediately; I'm sure he'll cancel this insane order."
514435, "Don't worry, I will."
514436, "Damn it... I'm too late then! "
514437, "Perhaps you can still make it! Catch them, tell them to stop-you're a celebrity, they'll listen to you!"
514438, "Where did they take him? "
514439, "A celebrity, but not for them. No one is going to listen to me... "
514440, "And you also resisted? Fought back even? With what, I wonder?"
514441, "Why are you making fun of me? Do you know how terrible it was? They've killed almost every man... Those who survived ran to find backup... They had the courage to go outside, by the way!"
514442, "What did the soldiers want? "
514443, "Why? "
514444, ""
514445, "Aha! And here's the good architect. So you came here on your own accord? Willingly? Why no escort?"
514446, "I'm not an architect. I'm a bachelor. "
514447, "A bachelor, an architect, who cares! I'm not going to waste my time getting to know you. Tell me, was it you that perforated my men yesterday? Well, now we're gonna perforate you. If you're religious, now is the time to pray."
514448, "You're mistaking me for someone else! "
514449, "Come on, hands on the nape, face to the wall. There, to the car. Hand your personal belongings over. Quick-march! "
514450, "But this is an absolutely absurd! Wait! I'm not the person you were going to shoot! "
514451, "Fine. But not to the car, take me to the Steppe. I want to have a smoke before I die... "
514452, "Are you out of your mind? I want to see your superior officer, Alexander Block. "
514453, "Your Block is not our superior. He was only just appointed to be our commander. So don't run complaining to him, we don't take orders from the guy."
514454, "You're making a terrible mistake. "
514455, "This reeks of a court martial, officer. "
514456, "The escort is dead."
514457, "Ain't you feisty... Why did you come then? "
514458, "I want to know who has ordered to arrest me. "
514459, "I did. Now what?"
514460, "I want to see Alexander Block. If he finds out whom you have shot, you'll be standing against that wall in an hour."
514461, ""
514464, "Oh, have you seen my brother? He must be in the pub-where else can he be..."
514465, "No. I haven't seen him. "
514466, "Right, yesterday he stood up for me and killed an officer... So the den denizens have been waiting all night long for the soldiers to come... But no one has, until dawn... As for me, yeah, I've had visitors all right! But I haven't found a trace of them here..."
514467, "I'll check the pub up."
514474, "I won't make it if the flower falls down... I should have passed away yesterday. Now I'll be bound to roam this vale of tears-worthless... powerless... restless like a ghost..."
514475, "Peter, what's happening to the Kains? What does your Tower have to do with it? Tell me-you know them well, after all..."
514476, "Do you believe in the existence of the immortal soul? "
514477, "I do."
514478, "It just so happens that Maria believes in it fervently. Khan fancies my creation, but he only sees optical tricks in it and is reluctant to admit to its other qualities. But Maria... Maria believes that the Polyhedron can hold to the glint of a deceased person's soul. The Kains call it 'memory'."
514479, "She wants to lodge Simon's soul into the Polyhedron?"
514480, "Repeatedly reflected by reflections of reflections, disconnected from the ground, endlessly soaring between the firmament and the void... Yes. The Polyhedron was intended for Simon. It will become a shrine for the Kains-a shrine where they'll be able to turn to him for advice to prepare for their future achievements."
514481, "What does it mean? "
514482, "A man in fact is not the master of his inspiration. Inspiration is sent from above. It just so happened that all these years is has been coming from Simon... and from Nina, of course. I have a feeling that Maria has successfully executed an intricate scheme. Involuntarily, perhaps... but what's done is done."
514483, "What scheme? "
514484, "An intricate one. You are aware that Victor and Georgiy are already dead, right?"
514485, "You are mistaken. They're still alive. "
514486, "The senior Kains are no more. They've spent their whole life force to hold on to the memory of their beloved departed. The memory that has no Focus... because of us. Both of them are merely bodies now-inhabited by different souls."
514487, "Whose souls? "
514488, "Georgiy is holding on to Simon, Victor-to his beloved spouse, Nina Kaina, who had to be moved away from the Focus of the Crucible when Simon had left his body. But it's too confined for Simon. This house diminishes him."
514489, "Peter, you look unusually sober. I wouldn't have been surprised to hear something like this from you yesterday, but now..."
514490, "Drivel. Childish fantasies! I don't believe this."
514491, "I don't understand how exctly it works. It this magic? "
514492, "You can call it magic, but it's actually very simple and logical. In order to accept this much data-a whole living being, the essense of a departed person-you have to surrender your own life. As they say, you can't fit two I's beneath the same roof."
514493, ".. What happened? "
514494, "What is 'memory' for the Kains? "
514495, "A person dies. The memory of him keeps living for as long as his way of thinking and loving is remembered, but more importantly-he lives for as long as the power emanating from him is remembered and sensed. The power that inspires the exhausted. The power that strengthens the doubters. That is, if the memory is of a great person, of course..."
514496, "Are you trying to tell me that that's what a soul is?"
514497, "No. This is only an echo of a soul. A reflection. Do you really think that crafty optics can capture the immortal soul? A mere echo... But a deceased mother is alive to her children for as long as they remember the details of her life. And every second she's dripping away from them-because they forget."
514498, "But how can an edifice keep the memory of Simon? "
514499, "I don't."
514500, "We'll see how it pans out."
514501, "What? Your bloody Tower is what had started all this!"
514502, "Oh, please help Andrey! Offer them me in exchange... just don't leave him! "
514503, "Don't be afraid. A student never leaves his peer in trouble. "
514504, "Fine. So you want to look at the foundation blueprints? Go ahead. As luck would have it, they're on me now."
514505, "Thank you very much."
514506, "No. I've no idea how much one has to drink to belch out a something like this. A construction like this is a waste of time and resources."
514508, "Actually, I only need the blueprints of the foundation to report to the Inquisitor."
514509, "Go back to your medicine, Dankovsky. And never judge the things you have no idea about! "
514510, "Go back to hell. "
514511, "Show me the blueprints. "
514512, "No way in hell. Your words were offensive."
514513, "Sooner or later you will... "
514514, "All of you are obsessed with murder and destruction... Why doesn't it occur to any of you that you can heal without cutting the sick parts off?"
514515, "Such is life. "
514516, "I've found the Silent House. "
514517, "Next time take me with you."
514518, "Oh, sure. I won't take a step out of bed without you..."

514958, "No problem. What do you wanna know?"
514959, "What diabolical game are you playing?"
514960, "Look! It's a magic sandbox! See how it reflects in the mirrors? It's because everything's for real there! Here's a town, we've made it out of sand. And there's this awful thing going on there-an EPIDEMIC! So it's all crumbling... the town is falling apart... But we've sent heroes there to fix it."
514961, "To fix it?"
514962, "It's rotting, see...? Eww. We hoped they'd think of something. Mure it in sand, at least... They're magical to, you know, the heroes are! Take you, for example-look how it all worked out! You used to be a doll and now you're alive. Perhaps the rest also work like this?"
514963, "Did you know that your dolls were alive?"
514964, "Everything is alive around here! It's this structure, it brings things to life. it's not like we're twisting anyone's arm... It just happens. All on its own. We only built the town-and then it became miraculous all on its own! And the dolls... We just stuck the throwaway ones in, they were lame anyway. Oops, sorry..."
514965, "That's fine."
514966, "Don't you touch anything else around here. And don't stick anything there anymore!"
514967, "Just-just don't you dare crush anything here. I'll try to fix it."
514968, "And what are you going to do now?"
514969, "Heal the town, please! Just look, it's so wonderful... It's alive and it's our favourite one... We won't be able to make another one like this. If it can't be helped, then it will disappear forever. You know how much we love it?"
514970, "A surprising twist..."
514971, "I didn't think you could love at all."
514972, "Indeed. I agree with you on this."
514973, "So how did you go about sending the heroes?"

514977, "...Who are you?"

514980, "No! You aren't our plaything anymore."

514989, "I see. "
514990, "You're calling me a doll, you whelp?"
514991, "Hey, don't call me names! Take it easy! Okay, it wasn't me who's made you, but I've had you since I was three. You're a doll-ask anyone! Your name is Bachelor. You're the scary clown. You're always the evil guy when we're playing."
514992, "I'm going to demonstate this to you once more!"
514993, "Really? So you're not a doll? Go ahead, hit me then. Well, why are you just standing there? I dare you! Hit me with everything you have!"

515007, "Well, we did need to find some use for you. We never liked you all that much anyway... You've always been the scary doll. Playing with you was no fun."
515008, "...So you stuck the throwaways into the thick of it."
515009, "The ones that could fix things! You can't always have a Smart Doctor Man at hand. That's just how the game goes. Will you help us heal the town?"
515010, "...I'll heal it for my own sake, not for yours."
515011, "No! I'll destroy it just to spite you!"
515012, "Get the Commander out of there then."
515013, "That's impossible now! We can't. Mirrors make it all very complicated. You can't take your move back once you've made it-these are the rules of a real live game."
515014, "I'd rather it was an unreal dead game."
515015, "Then just don't touch anything."

515060, "Did I hear you right? Who is it speaking?"
515061, "It's me, the player."
515062, "Oh! Then I apologise profusely... You are definitely not a doll, but that seems to be unhelpful for our hero now. He is humiliated, crushed, but most importantly he is deprived of the power that we have all hoped for. By the way, are you still willing to take responsibility for him?"
515063, "Yes. He is my responsibility. I will stay with him to the very end. His words shall be my words. His deeds shall be my deeds."
515064, "Oh... Then I apologise once again. Perhaps not all is lost yet. Let's wait for the finale and see if the day brings any surprises. We still have a chance to play in a drama with an unpredictable story."
515065, "Watch me act."
515066, "Yes. And highlight Bachelor Dankovsky better. It's my solo now!"
515067, "No. I don't need a humiliated, crushed, and powerless hero. I'm fed up with it all, actually."

515070, "No. Do as you wish."
515071, "It's me, the Bachelor. "

515074, "Tell me-who are you in this puppet world? "
515075, "We do not belong to the puppet shows. We are the actors of a mime performance. I, for example, am a Miserable actor. My line of character is always moaning the inevitable losses. Our repertoire is quite limited, really... The esteemeed impresario may have oversold the importance of the local Theatre."
515076, "Stop messing with me. Are you a Child?"
515077, "I am exactly what you think I am. A collection of poorly rendered polygons on a screen. Why are you giving me that look? Do not ascribe a more important role to me than the one I have been assigned from the very beginning. I'll fail a bigger role. The mask isn't expressive enough."
515078, "Then we have nothing to talk about."
515079, "Undoubtedly."
515080, "Take care, you little scribble."
515081, "Farewell. I am off to look for the esteemed puppeteers. I want to give them a severe belting and put them on the naughty step!"
515082, "What kind of face is hidden behind that mask? I bet it's the face of a child, and your tiny burring voice is revealing your real age!"
515083, "Oh! These are the words of the Bachelor. Only he could hear the tiny voice of an actor who is used to express himself with gestures only. "
515084, "Go to hell! "
515085, "If you know what we are, then who are you? "
515086, "Are you their puppet too?"
515087, "No. "
515089, "The first part of the game is over, Bachelor Dankovsky. Its meaning has been as follows. The Powers That Be gave you a task with a catch: to learn the truth. They set a definitive condition: this truth has to be nice. Your honour and the fate of your laboratory were at stake. Would you care to learn something?"
515090, "I think I am."
515091, "Well, I think you aren't. Let me tell you about the Law. It's not a state law, but rather a natural one. When mysterious evil emerges from nonexistence, it's a clear sign that this law has been violated. Disease is a retribution for trespassers. It's an attempt to restore the balance."
515092, "I don't understand."
515093, "This town is a minuscule cosmos-and it's the Cosmos for its inhabitants. It's too remote, too distant from the rest of the world to serve as an effective part of any other mechanism-so it's a mechanism in and of itself. A mechanism that's been disrupted. There must have been a flaw, a blemish; a redundant detail, perhaps. I want to find it."
515094, "I see your point. Well, if the line of thinking you've just demonstrated was sincere, I'd be willing to agree with you."
515267, "Peter is completely off his rocker. His mind is too clouded with twyrine for him to consider the consequences of his actions. Does he seek this self-bedazzlement on purpose? How can I possibly come to terms with such an obstinate man?"
515268, "Peter has agreed to flee the town with us. I must let Andrey know in good time; I leave him with the responsibility of sobering up his bibulous brother."
515269, "We have armed ourselves. This weapon will suffice to fight my hidden nemesis that stalks this place. Now I can return to Andrey."
515270, "The House of the Living is no more. It expired before it came to fruition. I am left with the gathered provisions. Perhaps I should take them to Lara Ravel's house."
515271, "I could bring the key to Alexander-that's solid proof that the town is in grave danger."
515272, "Andrey Stamatin, a man inspired and impetuous, can arrange the escape."
515273, "I'll have to persuade Peter, too. Andrey won't move an inch without his beloved brother."
515274, "Maria Kaina is the person that could sway Peter. All these people belong to the same circle-and a tight one, too..."
515275, "Turns out a sword of Damocles is hanging over Peter's head-and this sword will fall down as soon as Saburov attains unlimited authority. This news is bound to make Peter comply..."
515276, "Now I can assure Andrey that Peter has agreed to go through with this."
515277, "Some Bad Grief, a smuggler and a thief kingpin, can provide us with the weapons required for the escape."
515278, "Notkin, the leader of the urchins, will confirm that Bad Grief is telling the truth."
515279, "The Cathedral order was issued by the Bachelor. His word is enough to make the doors open."
515280, "Alexander's vengeful hand has to be stopped, for he is blind."
515281, "This is where Mark Immortell, a person of dubious allegiance, works. He is respected by the utopians. I need to come to know his way of thinking."
515282, "Maria sees prophetic dreams. What did she dream of this afternoon or last night? "
515284, "Vlad the Younger knows how to get the hardened and crusty Rubin hooked."
515285, "It would appear that possession of authority is not enough for Saburov. He doesn't just want to hold the power; he wants to use it to its full extent. Will he be able to resist the temptation of settling a personal score? I should definitely share these thoughts with Peter."
515286, "Lara is waiting. The chance of gathering the resources she requires is dwindling by the hour."
515287, "Young Olgimsky supports Lara Ravel's plans and is willing to donate money to her cause."
515288, "Yulia Lyuricheva is ready to invest into organizing The House of the Living."
515289, "Maria Kaina is willing to provide the funds for The House of the Living."
515290, "Lara has chosen this house to become the future refuge. This is where the food she has ordered is brought."
515291, "This is where Peter Stamatin, the most striking and the most dangerous Utopian, lives and works."
515292, "Rubin asked me to speak to his defence in front of the Judge, the eldest of the Kains."
515293, "Sadly, I will have to disappoint Lara: there's nothing living about the house she was hoping for."
515294, "Lara seems to have urgent business with me... "
515295, "The connection between Andrey and Peter is just too strong. Peter will neither talk nor listen until he's absolutely positive that Andrey is on his side."
515296, "...Finally, there's Yulia's business, too..."
515297, "So which of the three houses is Simon's? I should probably check them all, but I'll start at Maria's. I have a feeling she may prepare me for what I am about to see in the other two..."
515298, "Olgimsky has become strangely pliable. Apparently, he is mostly troubled by the Termitary. It has become a kind of Achilles heel to him. It is interesting to note that he asked me to solicit for young Burakh as he stands accused before the Kains. Could it be that something is wrong here?"
515299, "The madman is asking to inform the investigator of his madness. Does he really believe that the Inquisitor won't see through it? I can only conclude that he is not pretending."
515300, "Olgimsky has agreed to stop the harassment. I hope his word is enough for the keeper of that den."
515301, "The military are now the only real authority in the town. Let them handle the riotous masses then."
515302, "Please visit me at the Crucible at your earliest convenience./n/nAnother misfortune has befallen us-and again it concerns the person whom you have travelled so far to see./n/nI hope the woes of our family are still of some importance to you./n/nKain"
515303, "A Worrying Message from Georgiy Kain "
515304, "Unless he has left the Abattoir, Burakh should be somewhere around here."
515305, "The den was attacked by soldiers, and they took Andrey Stamatin. Perhaps General Block can interfere before it's too late."
515306, "Victor agreed to withdraw the demands at once. He does not want the Tower to be implicated. They seem to be hiding something there, but whatever it is, it is clearly not the disease. Moreover, I don't think I am the one they are trying to deceive. Perhaps I could use this whole affair as an excuse to sneak into the mysterious tower across the river. I can speak to Vlad about whatever secrets I uncover there."
515307, "Now I definitely have something to discuss with Vlad the Younger..."
515320, "Here lives an old enemy of the Olgimskys. Since they've decided to stand against me, perhaps Aspity can be my ally for the time being."
515321, "Lara has no water. Making an isolation ward in her home is out of the question. The viability of the House of the Living is questionable now."
515322, "If Vlad the Younger's words are to be believed, Mark Immortell is one of the people who received panacea from him."
515323, "An irreversible hardship has befallen us. Something has destroyed the town waterworks. Without water, all semblance of personal hygiene, sterilisation, the quarantine itself are as good as gone. We won't be able to keep the people indoors anymore. I should inform Olgimsky as soon as possible."
515324, "Mother will open the entrance before midnight. "
515325, "It's necessary to inspect the Cathedral. This is one of the few remaining buildings that still have running water."
515326, "It's necessary to inspect the Theatre. This is one of the few remaining buildings that still have running water."
515327, "The way to the Abattoir is through the Termitary. Its dwellers know how to get in and out..."
515328, "*****"
515329, "I need to take as many immunity stimulants as I can handle. Having done that, I will be able to survive in an infected house for at least an hour-provided I have enough antibiotics, of course."
515330, "*****"
515331, "Saburov was mistaken. Grief has nothing to do with this ongoing murder epidemic."
515332, "Grief would like nothing more than getting rid of Barley and his thugs. He even offered a reward for Barley's head."
515333, "Doctor Dankovsky,/n/nAs of today we are ready to provide you with the premises where you will be able to establish a hospital, an isolation ward, and a morgue. Please see me at the Lump to discuss further details./n/nVlad the Heavy"
515334, "Vlad Olgimsky's Report on Sanitary Precautions "
515335, "Not particularly well."
515336, "It's only natural..."
515339, "'Vaccine'"
515340, "The disease has evaded us twice already, but now it is firmly within our grasp. All we require is a heart that contains the living pathogen. They say that Burakh is a virtuoso of the scalpel, so I merely need Olgimsky to introduce us."
515341, "Lara Ravel has informed Olgimsky of Burakh's capture by Saburov's people. Now Burakh is on death row, if Saburov has not already executed him. Saburov has a well known habit of jumping to conclusions. It wouldn't surprise me if he accuses Burakh of Isidor's murder. Either way, if Burakh is still alive then it may be worthwhile to help him out of jail, insofar as he may be of use to us yet."
515342, "Katerina was unable to contain herself. Her ramblings gave her away. According to her, Burakh is held near his own hideout, the house across the street, perhaps? There is another, though; a witness of him being arrested-one of Lara Ravel's friends."
515343, "Burakh is somewhere in the Works. There are quite a few separate workshops there. With all the information I have collected, finding him shouldn't be that much trouble."
515344, "The soldier gave me a good idea. If the thieves are so mad at the patrolmen, then why not let them do the dirty work for us? I need to talk with Bad Grief about it. If I deal with these people myself, Saburov will surely put me in pole position on his extermination list."
515345, "That does it; there is no time to spare. I will have to meet with Burakh at once; before my associates are done with their ungentlemanly assignment. Otherwise we will have to undertake this cat and mouse chase throughout the town once again."
515346, "I have arranged to meet with Burakh at nine in the Blind Backyard. Or somewhere in the near vicinity if something scares him away. I hope he has something for me."
515347, "*** We've caught the bacteria! The blood is teeming with these voracious monsters. If Rubin manages to produce at least a single dose of the vaccine by morning, I won't have to face the Inquisitor empty-handed. With a weapon like this we may be able to stop the outbreak. Only one small task remains..."
515348, "To prepare an organic vaccine, Rubin requires a live heart from an infected person. There's no other way."
515349, "Perhaps Grief could be an unexpected ally in this matter? Why get my hands dirty... I'm not ready to throw away my reputation yet."
515350, "Grief is going to get revenge on Saburov for yesterday. He's asking for money to get his grunts out of jail..."
515351, "Burakh will hide a body with a prepared heart for me somewhere in these god forsaken backstreets."
515352, "Visit Andrey in the pub."
515353, "*****"
515354, "'The Arsonists'"
515355, "I can't help but remember one gut-wrenching old story. There was a travelling circus known as the 'Ace of Diamonds Caravan' who were-allegedly-kidnapping small children and turning them into monsters. Anna advises that we try and profit from the situation; that we might blackmail a good deal of money out of that hunchbacked usurer."
515356, "The hunchbacked fire eater-or whoever he was back in the day-has a heart. I wonder what kind of relationship he has with his daughter, as I detect a lecherous undertone beneath the worry in his voice. Either way, he clearly wants to have his daughter back. I wonder what Anna could reveal on this matter..."
515357, "The daughter had a traditional circus upbringing. What her father doesn't know is that she is working as a dancer in a twyrine shebeen. But why doesn't he know this? Is he disillusioned with the Caravan to such an extent that he wants to wipe the slate clean? Either way, I should talk with the daughter myself."
515358, "The girl has agreed to meet me at nine, in the place that we discussed. It is clear that there is more to her story than immediately meets the eye, but the circus performers were reluctant to indulge any information to me. Could it be that I am walking into a trap? A risky move, but I am not so naive as to not see it coming."
515359, "*** An unexpected denouement. The girl is dead and the Hunchback is out of his mind with grief. He is working to gather a mob of supporters with the intention of razing the entire town to the ground. A band of blood-crazed arsonists is the last thing this town needs! All because of me. Oh, how the Inquisitor would approve..."
515360, "Here lives the Hunchback, who turned out to be Anna's accomplice from her Caravan times... Or was he just an accomplice? Who knows what kind of relationship those two had..."
515361, "Anna has resorted to blackmail trying to pay off the people who are supposedly threatening her. Whatever the hunchbacked arsonist gives, she's willing to split the sum."
515362, "The Hunchback is willing to give a hefty sum, but for a different reason. He asked me to find his beloved daughter. I wonder who a Caravan fire-eater would refer to as a daughter, though."
515363, "It seems the Hunchback's daughter has been visiting this wonderful establishment at night. Is that really something a behaved child would do? I sense foul play..."
515364, "The Blind Backyard. Willow, the Hunchback's little girl, promised to meet me there at 9 o'clock."
515365, "'The Innocent Ones'"
515366, "Saburov was driven to paranoia by the barbers, so much so that he organised a raid. Half the town was in attendance and many innocent people were killed or wrongly imprisoned. While the dead cannot be helped, I could still try to give the survivors their freedom."
515367, "Apparently, appealing to a higher justice is futile. The rapacious Executors demand a ransom. I wonder what use these fearless corpsemen even have of money? It is worthless these days anyway... This whole day has been most absurd."
515368, "*** Saburov has set free the people who were wrongly incarcerated. Or at least those who did not die in prison. Unsurprisingly, the survivors are bitter beyond belief. Our governor's preventative measures may bring about the opposite result than intended."
515369, "*****"
515370, "The town jail is full of innocent people caught in the Saburov patrolmen's mass arrests last night."
515371, "*****"
515372, "The plague has found its way into the jail! A crooked executor-guard is willing to let the prisoners go for a hefty sum of money."
515373, "Victor Kain will surely help raise the money to bail out the prisoners. But should I really I be taking advantage of his generosity so much?"
515374, "Will Vlad the Younger contribute to freeing the prisoners?"
515375, "WAREHOUSE KEY. Unlikely to be usable for all warehouses. Most probably it will only open the warehouse where its unfortunate previous owner used to work."
515376, "Sticky has managed to track down a creature that very much resembles the notorious demon! It was last seen skulking around the Abattoir and it looks like it will be staying there for some time. Could it be the carrier? Or is this another wretched imitation with which fate mocks me."
515377, "The firestarters are going to attack the Termitary. Vlad the Younger could know more."
515378, "Big Vlad is trying to turn a blind eye to the Termitary attack. I wonder why."
515379, "Vlad the Younger has offered me a reward if I prevent the storming of the Termitary. Could he be trying to protect his father? The assault is set to begin in the evening."
515380, "Big Vlad is hiding something."
515381, "Troubling news, Bachelor./n/nAn accident of disastrous proportions has taken place in the Cathedral. At least a thousand people have died. The town is ripe for another murderous witch-hunt./n/nPlease come to see me as soon as possible./n/nVictor Kain"
515382, "Victor's Note "
515383, "It looks like someone is trying to get rid of several young women before the inquisitor's arrival. And that someone is governor Saburov."
515384, "It looks like someone is trying to get rid of several young women before the inquisitor's arrival. And that someone is governor Big Vlad."
515385, "Victor claims that Saburov and Olgimsky are trying to get rid of several young women before the inquisitor's arrival."
515386, "Saburov suspects Lara Ravel. Her posessions were found in the Cathedral this morning."
515387, "Saburov suspects Yulia Lyuricheva. Her posessions were found in the Cathedral this morning."
515388, "The governor suspects two upstanding young women. But can he be trusted?"
515389, "Vlad is blaming Aspity. Indeed, who else could he blame?"
515390, "Vlad is blaming Anna Angel. I wonder if this has to do with her yesterday's schemes."
515391, "Big Vlad suspects two young ladies of dubious reputation. He says they're both not from around here, but both have been living here for a while now."
515392, "I squeezed out a drop of Anna's blood. I will need to study it under a microscope as soon as possible."
515393, "Lara did not hesitate to give me her blood. I need to study it under the microscope."
515394, "Yulia volunteered the blood of her own accord. I am slightly suspicious of her self-awareness."
515395, "Aspity gave her blood with derisive confidence; self-assured, perhaps, in the way of steppe-woman trickery. Nevertheless, the microscope is immune to magic. It sees through all charm and deception."
515396, "Clara is the carrier? Well, well... Let's hear what the governor and his clairvoyant wife have to say about this saint girl they've taken into their home."
515397, "Katerina must know where to find Clara... but will she tell me?"
515398, "Katerina has washed her hands and left the betrayal to a humble girl named Grace. I doubt this increases my chances..."
515399, "What's going on in Katerina's home? Who is there? Who are they looking for? Either they're insane or I am. There's no third option. Or is there?"
515400, "A Steppe creature died here. Clara could be there now, grieving for it."
515405, "Clara's blood is in my hands. She seems confident and not in the least afraid. I cannot help but feel as a sceptic would feel when an illusionist offers him a seemingly empty hand."
515407, "The Stone Yard's watcher has been working here all this time."
515408, "The Earth's watcher has been working here all this time."
515409, "The Knots' watcher has been working here all this time."
515410, "The Inquisitor is putting down her own rules for the short period she's going to stay here. The Powers That Be cannot stop her."
515411, "Aglaya can't work with the documents until we know which one of the watchers is lying."
515412, "'Lies, Truth, and Everything Inbetween'"
515413, "The Powers That Be had dispatched at least three watchers to spy on me-to gather any valuable information they could find. The town is crawling with serpents in the skin of Executors. I should get acquainted with them. Collecting their reports for the Inquisitor might be a good place to start."
515414, "They don't seem to trust me. I will have to resort to deception. I will have just one question to ask each of them; a question to which they may tell the truth or tell a lie. There is no room for error here, however, so I must first solve the puzzle myself! If only I could pass for one of them, it would be easy to unveil the traitor. They know very well which one of them is."
515415, "*** Since the moment I arrived in town, the watchers have been there to spy on my each and every step, all in accordance with instruction from the Powers That Be. I am simply an out of favour bachelor, in over my head. This all seems too much for a small-town-backwoods-place such as this. What are they really looking for?"
515418, "The renegade was uncovered and is liable to whatever punishment the Inquisitor may choose. It will feel particularly rewarding to bring the coward to justice!"
515419, "Spare me! Don't tell the Inquisitor on me! Who knows-what if you regret your cruelty one day?"
515420, "That's possible..."
515421, "You're coming with me."
515422, "'The Mask and the Raiment'"
515423, "The demand for the Executors' terrifying garb is unexpectedly high. How convenient the costume department of the local theatre could have been, if only they had a spare costume available. I should look for one by the common grave where the caretakers were working. Or perhaps now would be a good time to ask Saburov about them."
515424, "Peter has been given charge of all burials and cremations. An absurd command, or well-planned revenge? Either way, this may be a good pretext for interrogating him as to why the governor hates him so much. I sense a hidden secret there."
515425, "It was a case of revenge-aggravated by treachery. If only they knew how easy it woud be to keep the former governor in check. He is unlikely to go against the Inquisitor's orders. Having said that, the brothers were a force to be reckoned with. An artist who trusts the genius of a colleague to the extent where he is willing to kill for it, is not a common occurence. A dangerous duet indeed."
515426, "*** I have obtained the mask of a thespian and the ceremonial raiment. By wearing these I will be able to pass for an Executor, or even a Watcher. Sometimes it is convenient to become a pure function without a face-to take on the position of the puppeteer, instead of the actor."
515427, "The executors that worked at this pit haven't been back since yesterday."
515428, "Some of Mark's stage props were taken by Alexander Saburov's men."
515429, "Alexander has handed the Executor garments to Peter after appointing him to oversee cremations and burials."
515430, "Oynon,/nTwo days ago I did you a favour. I ask that you return it today. I am in dire need of an undertaker uniform, which is to say a cloak and a mask of a kind worn by the Executors. It has become all but impossible to get your hands on these lately. Perhaps there are some in the Theatre still, but that is a place I am not allowed to enter. Get a cloak and a mask for me, please! I'll give you anything in return./n/nArtemy/n/n* The Changeling is very likely to make the same request of you. Take my advice and decline her. She'll trick you. Don't tell her I warned you though! People will die if you do."

515435, "Aglaya has briefly studied the evidence and concluded that the bacteria are of mineral origin. Now that I think of it, it does seem plausible. Vlad the Younger has agreed to help us follow up on this hypothesis. It's about time I found out what he is using his well for."
515436, "Enough! It's time to bring the Olgimsky family out into the open. I could easily find common ground with Aspity, however disagreeable she may be. She is rather loquacious and she let slip that the protector of the Kin has an axe to grind with the Olgimskys. Aspity is not so good a liar that I couldn't see right through her."
515437, "The whole thing proved to be a trivial affair, but no less terrifying for it. When Isidor informed the Olgimskys of the impending outbreak, it was the younger who did what the elder did not dare to. But as the consequences became known, it was the father who shielded his son from the ramifications. A double deceit. This being known, I am in a strong position to speak with the Olgimskys."
515438, "Dear Doctor,/n/nThe Termitary is open. Nothing bars your passage inside... I beg your forgiveness for having concealed the true purpose of the blockade. I am guilty indeed, but whatever I have done, I was acting in good faith and with good intentions./n/nVlad Olgimsky"

515441, "What remains of The Kin-those who were so large in number, but are now regrettably scarce-still follow the whims of one little girl. This little girl now demands the surrender of whoever caused the wholesale death that took place in the Termitary. Her intentions are clear, but what am I to do next? This is the question."
515442, "The mistress of the Termitary is unhappy with the living toys she has. She wants another toy-a  new favourite one. Were I to assist in the acquisition of such a toy, she has agreed to grant me entrance to the Abattoir, where the bowels of the earth will reveal their secrets to me. Truth be told, I am not looking forward to going there."
515443, "The Mother Superior will grant me passage into the Abattoir. The central entrance-used normally by the workers-will open soon after dark."

515445, "'The Miracle of the Children'"
515446, "As long as I have been here, it seems the Tower has remained completely untouched by the disease. Even so, it does not escape the scrutiny. The Inquisitor has tasked me with its investigatation; an untainted appearance will not suffice. Only Victor's son, Khan, is able to let me inside the Polyhedron, but rumour has it that Victor no longer holds any influence over his son."
515447, "Apparently, Khan wants to play soldier. He may be a child, but he speaks in a manner beyond his years. What could he possibly want with five rifles? I refuse to believe he would be so irresponsible as to exchange fire with the entirety of General Ashes' artillery. Regardless, if it is five rifles that will get me inside the Tower, then so be it."
515448, "*** The Polyhedron is clear. But what is the nature of it? It appears as if it was built of a dream, a vision of itself... The children do say that it can capture a reverie and make it reality. I wouldn't believe such a thing, if I hadn't seen these paper constructions with my own eyes."
515449, "'Clarity and Focus'"
515450, "Aglaya has taken an interest in the Polyhedron. She says that it is too unusual to exist. Yet there it stands, no mere imaginary construct. How can she dismiss it so easily, what with all the children living inside? Only Peter Stamatin-the architect of the Tower-will have the answer to the puzzle."

515457, "Then it should be of interest to you that your friend is to be held responsible for the crime of murder in cold blood of four servicemen. Our informer has indicated that the murderous architect resides in this very house. The sentence is to be executed immediately. And now you are going to tell me where the offender can be found."
515458, "But Peter is not guilty! He couldn't have murdered a person!"
515459, "We have provided you with all the necessary explanations. What else do you want?"
515460, "Vacate the building. This is an architect's study, not a barrack."
515465, "That's it, now you've done it... Fire!"
515466, "Belay that order!"
515467, "Rubin is the only one who knows the actual fate that befell Simon Kain. He must tell me the truth."
515468, "Here, you see, I brought the twyrine. Now give me the designs. "
515469, "Here you go. Carefully, or they'll catch fire. Have you seen how it burns, by the way? It's a feuer-werk! The flame of deep green, navy, purple, crimson, black! You're going to see it now... "
515472, "I'll help her, Peter. Do not give up so easily. Come out of the pyre."
515473, "So they decided to get rid of Peter after all? What does Andrey have to say on the matter? I'd like to hear him boast now of how he cares for his emotionally fragile sibling. I must find Peter before he does anything reckless, like burn any evidence of his work. He must be hiding somewhere in town... but where?"
515474, "Peter has requested five bottles of twyrine. With these, he plans to kill himself. His request, however, provides me with much needed time to delay. The main thing of course is to prevent him from burning his designs..."
515475, "I have recovered the priceless designs. I should take them to the Inquisitor immediately."
515476, "*** We should give no heed to rumours and hearsay. These manuscripts and these designs are the work of a restless genius. They are erratic, spontaneous and incoherent... Hopefully Aglaya will be able to unpick their meaning. I am sure there is a deep seated, rational explanation behind it all."
515477, "'The Foundation of a Miracle'"
515478, "How in the world is this building supported when the very nature of it is insupportable? Perhaps the staircase itself is a form of reciprocal frame on which the whole thing rests. Perhaps it is the complete opposite. The base of the building is not a structural support, but instead an anchor to hold this floating structure to the earth in the way of a stepladder thrown from a dirigible."
515479, "Andrey Stamatin-the last architect daring enough to reject the fundamental laws-has been brought before the firing squad. They took him out to where the cannon is parked at the stand-by railway and then shot him. A symbolic gesture if ever there was one; a testament to the construction of destructive artillery while they demolish the creator of inconceivable edifices."
515480, "I have unearthed the basis of the miracle... In order to support the Tower, the spire was drilled precariously deep into the earth. The consequences of this are most dire. I should take the designs to the Inquisitor."
515481, "*** The very soil on which the town is built is seeping with poison. The construction of the Tower had uncovered something that was laying in wait. The cause of the outbreak is clear now; it is a systematic certainty. Does this mean, however, that we must destroy the Tower? This dying town is already beyond salvation, but the Polyhedron-this epitome of human aspiration-may be saved..."

515528, "Yulia Lyuricheva's take on him:/n'He is a husband worthy of his wife. Whatever power each one of the ruling houses possesses is predicated upon a kind of dependable amalgamation between the preternatural power wielded by the Mistress and the magisterial injunctions issued by the head of the family. However, Katerina is known to be sterile, which leaves Saburov with nothing but brute domineering. As soon as the moment is right, Saburov will attempt to seize absolute administrative power. In so doing he will compensate himself for the debilitating misery of his spouse.'/n/nRubin's take:/n'Alexander is a hero. When fire broke out in the Skinners, he took a pike pole into his own hands to break into burning houses, save people, and put out fire. That's just how it was. Curiously enough, he kept his incognito back then and emerged from the ordeal unrecognized; neither did he flaunt his feat later. The truth came out accidentally. That is a very typical situation; Alexander is just that-an everyday hero who often demands no credit. It's a very unique kind of heroism.'"
515529, "Maria's take on him:/n'I am quite fond of Andrey. The twins are the two sides of a single whole, but Andrey has the capability to execute Peter's fantasies and designs. He is resolute enough not only to admit the possibility of the impossible, but also to implement it through persistent creative work. My uncle is quite capable of the former too, but the latter...! A personality like Andrey's deserves nothing but admiration...'/n/nVlad the Younger's take:/n'Without Andrey's boldness, Peter's vivid imagination would have only existed on paper. It's a shame that the duo is in decline right now, really. Peter is a habitual drinker and Andrey wastes his life on debauchery and ruthless feasts. But dormant periods are common among creative people; they emerge from them carrying the prey of new discoveries in their teeth...'"
515530, "Peter Stamatin's take on her:/n'The poor thing has lost her voice. I sympathize with her because she keeps her chin up, and I hate whiners. I'm thoroughly convinced that she's paying the price for someone else's sin; a haunting visitor eager to rip out her soul is coming after her any day now. At least that's what she thinks. A lesser person wouldn't have managed to endure such torture.'/n/nYulia Lyuricheva's take:/n'Anna affects to be suffering, but her hypocrisy is all too easy to see through. If she was genuinely wanted-for her involvement with the February Riots, or that Caravan of kidnappers-she would have been found years ago. She is able to trick her destiny for now, but her luck will run dry soon enough. The Ace of Diamonds Caravan has left a ghastly imprint on her, the way it did with everything it was linked to... yet the nature of the link between the caravan and Anna remains a mystery.'"
515531, "Alexander's take on him:/n'Vlad is a cunning and unfriendly man. Dealing with him is tough. I find it odd that he runs the Kin so smoothly. Civilized people can't usually find a common tongue with our Steppe people; you have to turn into a beast regularly in order to communicate with them. I think they've stricken some sort of secret pact; this peace has to have a hefty price.'/n/nVictor's take:/n'The town prospers thanks to his acumen. He watches over the arteries and has a firm hold over the economy. The Abattoir, the factories, the warehouses; the trading processes themselves are completely under his control. Saburov and I have long abandoned our attempts to interfere with his domain; we don't have the slightest idea of The Bull Project's day-to-day life. I wouldn't be surprised to find out one day that Vlad had installed slavery there.'"

She is trustworthy. She wouldn't ever stoop to betrayal. She could be the Soul of a Focus, were she not enamoured of death so bizarrely and persistently.'"
515534, "Yulia's take on him:/n'A potent mind to say the least. Encyclopaedically educated, well versed in Mathematics and Physics, has appreciable background in Astronomy. With all that, his chosen field of study is decidedly occult. And it is impossible to disregard how successful he is at that. However awkward it may appear at first glance, the quotidian and the numinous often complement each other very well.'/n/nAlexander Saburov's take:/n'Georgiy is no successor to Simon. Semblance in appearances doesn't necessarily imply internal likeness. Kain is too deranged to be a good ruler. Were he, say, to rule our country, he would have turned it into some kind of theocracy.'"
515535, "Peter Stamatin's take on him:/n'What is he? A storekeeper that neither keeps nor stores. He's got a whole community of birds of his feather there. Somehow they manage the warehouse business past Big Vlad's pocket. They accept twyre-gatherers and throat-cutters as their brethren; uncharacteristically of the locals, sometimes they put their knives to use. But really, their twyrine is something else...'/n/nVlad the Younger's take:/n'His real name is Grigory Filin. The thieves call him Big Bad Grief, even though he's merely a nuisance. Grief is the kingpin of the shady world. Name any prohibited item-and rest assured they're selling it. Father has no choice but to tolerate him; somehow these loafers managed to get a firm hold over the workmen community. If only we had direct communication options with them, there would be no need for those parasite middlemen... or should I say meddlemen?'"
515536, "Eva Yan's take on him:/n'Kaspar is the dark leader of the children. He has a lot of followers. An extraordinarily courageous boy; that alone is reason enough to respect him. Like all Kains, he's been practising Novel Art since childhood. He is privy to mysteries that often turn out to be genuine and effective. It's not often that he refers to them, sharing the knowledge quite unwillingly. Capella and he are the rulers of the children's world in our town.'/n/nKaterina Saburova's take:/n'He is an ivory-tower mandrake, born and bred. An imperious and smart boy that's been offered an opportunity to do deeds of an epic scale, without any regard for the price that will have to be paid for them.'"
515537, "Eva Yan's take on her:/n'Yulia is a very smart person, I could never match her intelligence. She's quiet and humble... and perfect. She also possesses a very unique kind of spiritual austerity and purity; she sets the bar higher for herself than for the rest. Yulia has a very intricate way of thinking. I could never learn to think like she does...'/n/nLara's take:/n'I find Yulia very nice, but I can't stand the way she thinks. This fatalism of hers is depressing and crushing, and it's appaling to see a mind that bright base its theories upon a false foundation. I believe that any predetermination is an insult to the freedom of choice. I guess it all goes back to the past, when she worked with the Dream Party.'"

I'd be glad to see her become the White Mistress.'/n/nVlad the Younger's take:/n'Capella is to the children what Maria is to us. Wherever she appears, children go crazy, as if they were given an adrenaline shot straight to the heart. The only thing that confuses me is the promises of a new life that she tries to hammer into their heads. She claims to be a priestess-but what gave her the right? Her mother's blood? No. She will not grow to be a Mistress.'"
515539, "Aspity's take on her:/n'A queen turned witch. That's what you get for dabbling with the spirits of the night. After Nina died, Katerina shamelessly rushed to take the place of the Dark Mistress; the burden of caring for the town was Victoria's, so petty games were still allowed. She got carried away though... Rumour has it, she needs daily morphine injections and welcomes cold-skinned visitors in her alcove at night...'/n/nLara's take:/n'Katerina took a hard hit and managed to pull through. Who could survive between Nina's rock and Victoria's hard place? That's how the town worked back then-upon this rock Nina was forging it, while Victoria maintained a firm stance to keep it in check; Katerina was the one to ensure the balance was in place. I also admire how much Alexander and she love each other. They could have been the grand kings of old-noble, resolute, and honest. Now is simply the wrong time for them.'"

515541, "Capella's take on her:/n'She's the kindest person I know. Lara has taught me how to give presents, which is an intricate art in and of itself.

The year before last he volunteered as a Fourth Army captain. Yes, I mean the Fourth Army.'/n/nStanislav Rubin's take:/n'After captain Ravel was shot during the battle of Karstov Fords, newly-orphaned Lara turned her father's house into The Shelter. The house that's been built by Olgimsky in exchange for... a favour. She is both sensitive and sensible; a rare combination in our neck of the woods.'"
515542, "Katerina's take on her:/n'She speaks to the dead. Sometimes you can find her sitting by a grave and humming a lullaby. She offers them gifts too, quite unusual sometimes: typewriter carriages, say, of birthday cakes with candles lit. She obviously has a great affinity for music, but plays no instruments. Her singing is enchanting but raspy, as if she was short of breath.'/n/nAspity's take:/n'Grace is nuts, plain and simple. You can easily recognize her by the breath; she inhales deeply, loudly, and... hoarsely, as though it's hard for her to take air in or as though she was about to break into tears. Her breath is fresh though, clean, even sweet-scented somewhat. That is actually rather uncanny considering her line of trade. And she talks to me as though I were dead too.'"
515543, "Andrey Stamatin's take on her:/n'Maria is concealing her true power for the time being, but it has already become apparent that she will stop at nothing when the time comes. Her sheer power will justify any despotism that would spring from it. The brilliance of her talent is going to surpass even Nina's one day. Maria will be grabbing stars by the handful while sipping earth's magma. And that means there are still things in this world worth living and hoping for!'/n/nKaterina's take:/n'Whenever I imagine what this town is going to become when she grows up, I feel nothing but dread. It took all of us to hold Nina the Terrible back-Victoria, me, and even the Kains themselves. Little Victoria will not be able to stand up to Maria on her own; I will not be staying in this world for much longer; and Victor adores her... so who will harness the midnight filly?'"
515544, "Lara Ravel's take on him:/n'I think it's the Masks who play him and not the other way around. This Theatre generally gives me a dark vibe... I can't really put it into words. It's not a theatre, but rather a well pretending to be one. It's intimidating. Also, Mark's mime shows seem to incorporate us, too... everyone's playing along to avoid disrupting the performance, and that's exactly how he's manipulating us.'/n/nMaria's take:/n'He makes me anxious; his performances don't show a person's fate, they impose it. I'd really like to see someone grab and pull the puppeteer's strings! Or maybe we ought to loop the whole thing, offering the strings to the people at the very bottom? That would be funny... All in all, one day I shall tame this crafty imp-no matter what it takes!'"
515545, "Capella's take on her:/n'She's very young, almost a baby... Her game in the Polyhedron was generally the same; she also assumed the role of a divine child that was worshipped and looked after not out of duty, but simply because taking care of someone that lovely brings you satisfaction and joy.'/n/nAnd also:/n'The children happily picked her game up because Mother had a lot of information about the Kin-the world that's always been poles apart from the Polyhedron...'"
515546, "Sticky's take on her:/n'We're friends with Murky, even though she's just a little tot. I'll have you know that she's actually very independent. One thing Murky is seriously fond of is digging and playing in the mud. You can also sometimes see her push along somewhere looking all preoccupied-and the places she chooses are usually, like, sinister... I respect that.'/n/nGrace's take:/n'Little Murky is an orphan. Her mom and dad lie by the eastern wall here. They died five years ago. I don't know why-they won't tell me, they're always weeping. As for her eating dirt, that's untrue. I've never seen it.'"
515547, "Lara Ravel's take on him:/n'Why does nobody notice how hardworking he is? He works all the time! Everything he does, he does for the family, even if his father won't admit it. Yes, he chose to study the Kin instead of the intricacies of economy-and he already knows it way better than his father. He'll grow to be a better manager and a better ruler that would make do without a whip, violence, abuse, victims, and riots...'/n/nVlad Olgimsky's take:/n'A high-stepper! Instead of settling down and helping me manage the industry, he'd rather dabble in the local fairytales! This loafer's most refined skill is wasting my money. He's rather quick-witted when it comes to business, I'll grant him that; all the more shame on him for casting everything on his father. And to think he took after me!'"
515548, "Capella's take on him:/n'Notkin used to be Khan's best friend. I don't know what their quarrel was about, but most likely it was about Notkin not wanting to dance to his whistle. For what it's worth, they also say that he was banished from the Polyhedron by the Mother Superior-before she returned to the orphaned Termitary.'/n/nKhan's take:/n'After Mother left, we invited him back, but he, in his pride, refused. Instead he chose to dig a lair by the Warehouses and play the 'Soul-and-a-Halves'. A dangerous game, seeing how Grief isn't afraid of Father in the slightest. Notkin took a risk, but that drew other misfits to him. And that's how they started their slummy society.'"
515549, "Katerina's take on her:/n'However odd, Aspity is a good person. She talks about death all the time. She asked me once why there is no Saburova Tomb at the Stone Yard cape and when it was about to appear-and she looked so innocent! She respects me as a Mistress, and that is something I cannot simply brush aside, especially since my followers abandon and betray me with each passing day...'/n/nSticky's take:/n'Such a mysterious creature! No one knows how she came to be in the town. Unlike others, she's not in danger because she's immortal like Simon. They also say that after Simon had cast off all that was evil in his heart, the Steppe provided bones for her body, and that's how Aspity was born!'"
515550, "Anna Angel's take on him:/n'While it's common consensus that both of them are brilliant, you don't need to be the brightest tool in the shed to see that Peter is the real genius. Such people are only born once a century. Not that I deny Andrey his talent... But Peter has drowned his gift in twyrine long ago, and it's become glaringly obvious that Andrey is nothing without him. Now Andrey believes that it is his duty to protect Peter and serve as a middleman between the harsh reality and the drunkard brother!'/n/nAlexander Saburov's take:/n'Both of them are rabid villains! Bonus points to Peter for also being a murderer. No matter what his creative achievements are, I would have ended him long ago, were he not almost completely mentally deranged. Wild, cruel, disruptive; four hundred years ago this type of artists were more than satisfied with using a knife for a brush and blood for paint! This is the kind of people that believe that creativity absolves any sin!'"
515551, "Alexander Saburov's take on him:/n'A strong person in every sense of the word. He can break your neck or set your dislocated joint equally easily. A very gifted autodidact. His main concern is the others, never the man himself. A selfless man. A man of principle. Someone you can always rely on.'/n/nVlad Olgimsky's take:/n'He was old Burakh's best student. Wilful. Headstrong. Sturdy. He will always do what he believes to be the right thing and be stubborn as a mule about it. It's almost impossible to find a common tongue with him. He doesn't respect any authority except for that of his precious master...'"
515552, "Bad Grief's take on him:/n'Now that's what I call good thievin'! A nimble lad, he is. Snatchin' a ring off your finger like there's no tomorrow, knowin' all them ins n' outs everywhere... and the lockpicks he makes! Man can always recognize the hand of a true master, dontcha think? I'm totally makin' the lad my minion as soon as I get my hands on him. He's a snappish pup all right, all bark 'n bite both, tryin' to keep away from good old Bad Grief... But who knows-perhaps one day he'll be the heir to the throne of the King of Thieves... It's anyone's guess if I'm really gonna do it.'/n/nCapella's take:/n'That cryptic creature that he had encountered in some desolated corner of the town has really changed him. It seems to have turned into a mania. The main goal of his adventures used to be a nonexistent hidden treasure, but now he's going crazy for that longneck monster. He's positive that is the last vampire...'"
515553, "Vlad the Younger's take on him:/n'He's not a hundred percent human. Rumour has it, he's a descendant of bulls. He oversees the work since he comes from a menkhu family. The Abattoir's transformation into a prosperous industrial facility that simultaneously remains a pagan temple only happened due to his efforts. I have no idea how he manages to do it.'/n/nVictor Kain's take:/n'The lower level of town management is reserved for chtonian creatures indeed-and we cannot simply ignore them. Each of them has established certain reputation within his enclave; the Foreman-in the Abattoir, Bad Grief-in the catacombs beneath the warehouses. You can't really feel their presence in the town itself; it crawls sideways, grabbing those who make an unwitting step towards it with its invisible tentacles. The tentacles being the twyrine market for Grief and the echoes of our town's past for Oyun.'"
515554, "Yulia Lyuricheva's take on him:/n'A new structure of power relationships is being established in the town. Personally, I would have preferred the next triumvirate to be led by Victor. Alas, Victor is utterly loathsome of anything that has to do with fame, authority, or public adoration. He has every right to claim the throne, but he will hand it over to his daughter. Just like he did before, when his terrifying wife was still with us.'/n/nAndrey Stamatin's take:/n'Victor was the only person who could control Nina the Wild. She obeyed Simon and Georgiy too, but that was only out of respect for the family's strict morals. And yet Nina followed Victor's word unquestionably-although he never demanded that from her. It's all very mysterious. How did he tame the demon and why did he allow her complete and unrestricted freedom?'"

515598, "You do know why they incriminate you, right? They say you have desecrated Simon's remains. Frankly, I'm surprised you haven't been discovered yet."
515599, "They're too afraid of Bad Grief's thugs-ironically, it is they who volunteered to protect me from honest townsfolk! Search parties swinging firearms and torches have passed through the northern Warehouses a few times. That was close... but I think I'm off the hook for now. Thankfully I've kept this place a secret from anyone save for my apprentices. "
515600, "So you've got them at least, right?"
515601, "Two of them did come to help me. I haven't seen either of them since yesterday. I think they've fallen sick. But they managed to get a lot done the other day! I was even able to conduct some tests!"
515602, "I see you had a productive day yesterday."
515603, "So a full-fledged vaccine is out of the question?"
515604, "Unfortunately, I'm not that good at chemistry-a vaccine would call for someone... less crude. The reagents I'm used to would ruin the source specimen; I'm lucky to have my teacher's solutions, at least-they proved to be useful. On the other hand, I've almost figured out how the vaccine may be compounded. I can almost write down the formula..."
515605, "How is it compounded, then?"
515606, "That depends on the results of the further tests. Hopefully we'll be able to run them today."
515607, "What exactly are you going to test today, then?"
515608, "Your message has left me confused, if not frightened."
515610, "...Why can't we just bring an infected person here and collect their blood?"
515611, "I tried it already! Didn't you say the bacterium dies along with the blood cells? It is even more drastic than that. The microbe survives for mere moments in its pure state. It splits, it converts the blood cells and it dies. However, a heart muscle..."
515612, "How do you mean, its pure state?"
515613, "What I mean is, the state the bacterium is in when the immune system begins to fight it. There are several stages of the microbe development. We need to nail the intermediate one."
515614, "What about it?"
515615, "If the sickness spreads to the heart, it makes a kind of colony there. I know it may sound ridiculous-I'm not really a scientist, I merely recall the observations I made. An infected heart would allow us to extract the bacteria at its most pure, most potent state; provided we work fast enough."
515616, "But what does a living heart have to do with all this?"
515617, "That's not medical research. That's paganism. You know what, forget it; I refuse to take part in this."
515618, "Fast enough? Why don't we just bring an infected person here and take as many blood samples as needed? One after another..."
515619, "The Steppe people are like that, doctor... You don't seem to quite understand the difference between you and... them. They are barely daunted with things that would scare us to death. The blood of a Steppe person belongs to the earth. One way or another, Burakh will be working in the infected quarters today."
515620, "Won't he be torn apart for desecrating the dead?"
515621, "Quite possibly. As his father's successor, he is empowered to open up bodies. But his succession is not necessarily acknowledged by simple townsfolk, so he's putting himself at risk... Still, he'll be dissecting the living today. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for us to get what we need."
515623, "Are you saying you want me to obtain it?"
515624, "Young Burakh offered his help. He was going to dissect the dying anyway. But he's already more than six hours late, so I'm forced to request your assistance. If we're unable to find Burakh, you'll have to perform the grisly task yourself."
515626, "I refuse. I'm a scientist, not a forensic specialist."
515627, "Is he going to infuse the blood with herb liquor as well? And take as many hearts as he needs if the first set of experiments fails?"
515628, "What if you take a dog or a rat?"
515629, "Some of my associates have tried it already; no point whatsoever. Human organisms will not produce antibodies to fight animal infections. Our enemy is sly as the devil himself. It's as if the disease... wanted us to take this symbolic step."
515630, "You have done a bloody great deal, my dear colleague. So have your associates, however scarce they were."
515632, "Just think of the meeting with the Inquisitor that lies ahead of you! What are you going to tell him? What alternative method of dealing with the outbreak will you offer?"
515633, "You're surprisingly well-informed for a person living in hiding... So who's the newsmonger? Was it Burakh?"
515635, "I'd rather not think about it."
515636, "I will eagerly await your return! Just remember, you have to act fast after you have procured the heart. You will be pressed for time. Leading the donor closer to here would help. If someone you know would kindly agree to help--do not refuse it, as long as they are reliable."
515637, "No. I refuse to take part in this."
515638, "Well then... Hopefully, I still have friends. A pity, though; I don't really think they'll make it. Not if they try to assist someone like me. But, duty above all. There's no time to waste."
515639, "Good luck."
515640, "Wait a moment. I changed my mind."
515641, "Perhaps you are better suited to the task?"
515642, "They'll arrest me the moment I step foot outside. Even if I conceal my face, the proportions of my body will give me away. I wouldn't have asked for your help if there was another option."
515643, "This is lunacy... I need some time to decide. Hopefully I'll figure out an alternative route."
515644, "The victory is near, colleague. Kindly wipe that smirk off your face; you won't have to wait long now."
515645, "I hope we get lucky."
515647, "The trust is mutual, colleague."
515650, "The blood seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary..."
515653, "All right, fine, I agree. We're unlikely to ever get another opportunity like this. I'll help you."
515654, "Just find out where the hell Burakh has disappeared to and talk to him! He'll do the deed himself."
515655, "No. Get yourself a butcher to perform the task."
515656, "I'd like to question him before Karminsky does."
515657, "That is something new! So now arrests, trials, and executions are all carried out by the same people?"
515658, "There are good reasons for the accusations. The patrolmen didn't file individual reports, but each one of them is ready to answer with their life for their actions. Those who were arrested deserved it."
515659, "How pompous...! Are the patrolmen considered infallible now?"
515660, "Let them go. They're scared enough already."
515661, "Don't ruin our friendship, governor!"
515662, "Mind your own business, Bachelor! Mind your own damn vaccines! Is the cure ready? No? Then what the hell are you doing here? I take full responsibility for my actions."
515663, "Are you telling me that the owner of all the industry in the town is facing financial difficulties?"
515664, "He's facing a lot of obligations. Obligations demand expenses."
515665, "Do you really have enough to help him out?"
515666, "Share and share alike? "
515667, "Unfortunately, the feeling isn't mutual. Take care, Anna."
515668, "How can it be done?"
515669, "Keep talking."
515670, "Whether the business is mine or not, the Caravan creeps me out. It's worse than cannibalism."
515671, "Well, I didn't travel alone... I had a companion. He was a snake charmer. When the Caravan persecutions and arrests started, his back was broken with an iron bar. So he's a usurer now-a spider of a usurer, weaving a net of debtors! He must have amassed a ridiculous fortune. Imagine how much there is to be extorted!"
515672, "Is this your handiwork?"
515673, "Now that was just mean! Who do you think I am... a maneater? Why would I steal children? And she's not a child anyway, she is a grown-up girl already."
515674, "Do you know where I can find her?"
515675, "Yes, I am."
515676, "That's just lovely."
515677, "Come again?"
515678, "You may very well be right. In her situation death is preferrable to life, really."
515679, "So you've dragged the Olgimskys into this too? You slyboots. Well, with your kind permission, I'll keep the money. You've got what you wanted already."
515680, "Well, actually, I'll manage without him just fine."
515681, "It's a shame. Everything is lost then. There's no point arguing with Saburov."
515682, "I'll get them out of there."
515683, "Spare me your reprimands! Do you think it was I who gave him the power?"
515684, "Oh, the little Taya Tycheek! Heh, there is no Taya Tycheek in the Termitary. Come now, doctor! She's in the Polyhedron, just like all the other children. I love the little one myself, and my daughter does too!"
515685, "I just want to double-check that she's not there."
515686, "All right, I believe you."
515687, "I'm afraid I have to insist, boös."
515688, "Thank you for your concern."
515689, "That attitude will quickly change when an inquisitor gets to you."
515690, "That was obviously coming... Well, now the people in charge will pay for their criminal thick-headedness!"
515691, "At least some of them were lucky enough to escape that... stone pocket."
515692, "All right then. If there are few of them left, then let them die."
515693, "Don't you talk back at me! I'll have you digging graves somewhere in no time!"
515695, "How did you find me, oynon?"
515696, "I need your help."
515697, "What kind of help do you need? Before you reply, you must know that I'm already about to leave and undertake something rather risky. I've promised to help somebody."
515698, "Rubin and I need to get a sample of living bacterial culture to make a vaccine..."
515699, "If the person you've promised to help is Rubin, then there's no need to try and be in two places at once. It was actually him that advised I meet you."
515700, "I see. Master Rubin wants to take care of people. I admire that."
515701, "Rubin is worried; he's been waiting for you all night. So I've tried to find you, and my search has brought me here, to the Works."
515702, "You've been lied to."
515703, "Why do they say that your path is paved with corpses and that you're going to drown the town in blood?"
515704, "Will you help us get an infected heart?"
515705, "I will. I'll be working alone though. Meet me in the Blind Backyard at nine in the evening. I'll pick out someone whose foot is in the grave already, take them to a dark corner and start working. I'm likely to move around a lot, so look for me in the neighborhood."
515706, "I'll find you. "
515707, "I'll cut open the dying person and start working. If they find me, I'll lead the pursuit elsewhere; if that is how the situation unfolds, you'll have to pick the heart from the body yourself. I hope my harvest will be good for Stakh and you."
515708, "Why nine?"
515709, "That's when it gets dark. I've got enough enemies in the town already. Darkness offers protection."
515710, "What if something unexpected happens?"
515711, "I'm not a politician. I've saved a few innocent lives and have no desire to think through every possible consequence of my actions."
515712, "That's the easiest way. All the time we tend to be governed by either of the two extremities. We follow our heart and refuse to weigh the consequences of our actions, or we keep on reasoning, becoming flaccid with well-calculated inaction... Where is that spot that marks the perfect balance of the two? Only the chosen ones, like my brother, could aim for it with steadfast precision."
515713, "Are you talking about your forthcoming death? I never expected you to give in to despair so quickly."
515714, "Don't be the man that would jump to false conclusions. I never said I was going to die. I'm only saying that my brother is going to come back to us very soon."
515715, "I don't think my actions will result in negative consequences."
515716, "I'm sorry for your loss, Judge, but you have to let your brother go."
515717, "How could that be?"
515718, "To bring one's dearly departed back to life, there's no need to indulge in the farce of spinning tables, galvanization, and overturned tombstones. This spectacle is powerless to meet all but the most immature expectation. The fact of the matter is that the dead linger inside us-their living counterparts."
515719, "I don't believe in mysticism."
515720, "Yes. I see now that I've made a mistake. I should have left those people to die in jail..."
515721, "Your dark irony puts me to shame. You have made the right choice, dearest doctor. I admire your courage... and have great respect for you. People like you are preciously rare these days."
515722, "I've done quite a few wrong choices too."
515723, "You still have time to do a single deed that will redeem all your failures, errors, and oversights."
515724, "Hopefully."
515725, "...More than a single one."
515726, "That's some Eastern philosophy..."
515727, "I wouldn't know. What I do know, however, is that the dead may be brought back to life by the focussed emotions of the living. It's ludicrous how people picture a soul as an ethereal imitation of whoever it belonged to. It doesn't even occur to them that a soul is more resemblant of music than a human figure."
515728, "That was poetic."
515729, "Quite so. There are people whose memory is merely a sequence of simple melodic fragments. Then, there are those whose memory is more like a symphony. The more subtle a soul, the harder it is to retain it and reproduce it. It would require very special instruments, like any music does."
515730, "If this is the way you want to reunite with Simon, I can only respect your resolve."
515731, "That's a... curious hypothesis."
515732, "'The man to do the job'? Do you even know who I am?"
515733, "Nay... I don't. I've been living here all secluded, haven't been outdoors for almost a year. A year... yeah."
515734, "Was she kidnapped?"
515735, "She must've left at dawn and she's still not back... I went to sleep and slept like a log-the twyrine haze does that to you-and by my side was the pretty thing sleeping. In the morning, I woke up to find her gone. Neighbours didn't see a thing, them blind bats... I'd give you anything... I'm rich! Wanna get a hudred thousand? A hundred and fifty?"
515736, "Two hundred."
515737, "What happened to your daughter?"
515738, "FIne. Two hundred it is. Just bring her back to me!"
515739, "How do I recognize her?"
515740, "Your choice of words... is disturbing. I don't think I'll bring the girl back to you."
515741, "A hundred thousand is enough though."
515742, "Calm down. Let's talk it over..."
515743, "Cut it, will you? Pull yourself together! If she's sick, then she's already beyond help. If she's not, then she'll wait until the outbreak fades away and come back home, I'm sure... "
515744, "You think this is so sure that she will? It ain't! It ain't sure if she will!"
515745, "Is that so?"
515746, "You know the price tag, kind sir. The cash is on the nail. Bring my daughter back to me!"
515747, "All right. Any distinctive features?"
515748, "I don't like the sound of this at all... No thank you. No deal."
515749, "Too many questions at once, kind sir."
515752, "No. She was murdered."
515753, "She's in a pub in the Hindquarters."
515754, "Don't you dare!"
515755, "A hit on someone? How do you know?"
515757, "What revenge?"
515758, "Anna's, eh? She's beside herself, the lil' snake is, she can't wait to get to someone. Trust me, Doc, I can smell it. The dove of love is dyin' to peck a heart out."
515760, "Deal."
515761, "It's fine. The languishing is well-deserved."
515762, "Murders, murders, murders... like there's nothing else to talk about. To hell with you all."
515763, "I'll keep that in mind."
515764, "I'll go see Anna. Hopefully I'll see what this is all about."
515765, "Where should the forces of justice strike?"
515766, "Burakh is kept at the Works, in a building that..."
515767, "Got it, I know it. The cellar of the Corpulent Workshop. Roger that, as our forefathers used to say..."
515768, "Where do we meet?"
515777, "No. I'm not even going to try."
515778, "I don't want to take money from you. Use it for charity."
515779, "This is ridiculous. What am I going to buy with it? And from whom? Are you suggesting I deprive one bunch of fools of resources to favour another?"
515780, "Whatever."
515782, "Just tell me where the Blind Backyard is."
515783, "Here, let me show you on a map."
515784, "Don't get smart with me."
515786, "I'll be back soon."
515787, "So you'd rather do it the hard way? Sure, you just wait-I'll come back soon with others. Low rank, heavy build... tailored to your preference!"
515788, "You've made yourself clear. I'll be back with further instructions. "
515789, "I'll try to follow your advice."
515790, "Certainly."
515791, "Well, this makes sense."
515792, "I wonder where my girl is now... But she will fear no evil. She is a pure soul."
517834, ""
517835, "Venerable Bachelor? Please be so kind as to linger for a minute. This conversation won't take too much of your time, especially since time stops during dialogues... at least during the important ones. And our dialogue is extremely important! You need to know how to play after all, don't you?"
517836, "Play? What are you talking about, Mask Man? I'm neither a gambler nor an actor."
517837, "Of course you aren't! You are a living breathing man-as is evident from your conditions and statuses. You experience hunger, thirst, and fatigue; you suffer from pain, wounds, and diseases. You're so lifelike! You have to eat, drink, sleep, and rest. And to make mistakes..."
517838, "The latter being the most definitive proof of my human nature, wouldn't you agree?"
517839, "If I may, I would like to point out just how important it is to keep an eye on your condition. If you get dizzy or unnaturally sluggish, do have it checked up... Vital processes tend to run faster during emergencies than in everyday life. I knew a person who died of stress but was diagnosed with starvation..."
517840, "It happens. I can testify to that as a doctor."
517841, "Need I remind a wise man like you of the fact that hunger is sated with food? Food can be found in shops, and shops can be found in ordinary houses that are marked with specific signs. Sleep, however, is more complicated. People only sleep in beds and only in private residences around here. I am sorry, but that's just how our world is..."
517842, "Yes, the world is unjust."
517843, "And quite silly, if you forgive me for saying so... Speaking of commerce, different shops sell similar items at different prices. Make sure you don't get cheated... people can be quite brazen around here! You can also barter with the folk out in the street. Some things may be nothing more than trinkets to you, but others would be willing to part with their life's blood for them..."
517844, "Blood?"
517845, "Yes, blood... It's not my place to lecture you, but if-following your Hippocratic oath-you ever consider easing someone's pain, feel free to just approach them with a suitable drug. You will see their pain receding before your very eyes. The sick fall asleep when they're close to recovery, don't they?"
517846, "Or when they're close to their ultimate rest."
517847, "Still, helping the hopeless will grant you a good reputation. You will be seen as a benefactor willing to part with a precious sleeping draught or a painkiller for a simple bystander."
517848, "Anything else?"
517849, "No... No. Not yet."
517850, "Show me the way to Simon's house."
517851, "Turn left now. Then walk along the alley; you will see a Cathedral and three mansions across Bridge Square; Simon lives in the one that is the closest to the river."
517852, "Thank you."
517853, "Bye then, Mask."
517854, "No, I don't. Not me."
517855, "Who are you?"
517856, "A poor tragedian, if you please. A victim of circumstances, just like you."
517857, "You are mistaken. I am the director. The person in charge of the situation. I'm not a random actor."
517858, "You look more like a comedian. I don't have time to talk to you."
517859, "Some other time, kind stranger."
517860, ""
517861, "Halt! I'm going to have to teach you about the technicalities of the setting. The time and the place. It's non-essential, but that's just how it is-the actor has to be prepared before he goes onstage, or else he'll fall down the aisle or stumble upon the prompt box. That would look mighty silly, wouldn't you agree?"
517862, "Speak. I'm listening."
517863, "Time flies by. It can't be stopped or turned back. Nights follow days, which are then followed by nights. Things happen without any regard for whether you're there to witness them. Don't expect anyone to wait for you. Most events can be missed."
517864, "And so?"
517865, "And so it would make sense for you to visit the places that you care about regularly. You'll find the people that will play major roles in your fate there. They stand out from the common folk; the rest are just a crowd shot, a background, a bunch of extras."
517866, "As it has always been."
517867, "Indeed. Still, it's best to avoid hasty judgement. It's a paradox, you see: don't try to care too much for the lives of these... bound-to-stand-out people. And don't be too dismissive of the silent crowd. Both extremes will end in tragedy."
517868, "Why is that?"
517869, "This world cares for your reputation. A fine and crucial instrument. Your reputation changes the world you see-for it is a mirror, wouldn't you agree? And so a bad reputation can get you into a lot of trouble..."
517870, "For example?"
517871, "Oh, need I describe? You've got vivid imagination... Everything changes, from mystical aspects to mundane things like the people you need treating you badly. How many enemies you've got... How high the prices rise... How bad your dreams are... Lots of things."
517872, "A sorry prospect. So how do I maintain my reputation?"
517873, "Really...? How is that even a question? Same as anywhere! Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not lie. Thou shalt not betray. Do not steal... Do not covet... Do not be an asshole. Do not get caught... The rules are the same everywhere. A truly selfless deed-like risking something for thy neighbour or even a person who lives quite far away-can help in a dire situation."
517874, "I see."
517875, "Really? Good for you then. As for me, I can't see anything in this mask. I have no idea what's going on. Anyway, don't get too worked up about human lives. And don't put too much stock into another's words, mine included... He who trusts everyone is asking to be deceived."
517876, "Definitely."
517877, "Yet he who trusts no one is deluded. I know that from experience."
517878, "Speaking of trust, where does Simon Kain reside? I would be most thankful if you showed me the way."
517879, "Simon Kain does not 'reside', he lives, or rather exists! He reigns, he creates, he makes mistakes and brings joy to the people with the mere fact of his existence. All that happens at the Crucible. Go left along this alley. As you reach Bridge Square, look to the right. You'll see it."
517880, "Who are you?"
517881, "An actor in a tragic mime show. That's unimportant. Will you listen to me or not?"
517882, "I am listening."
517883, "No. I'll do without your help."
517884, "You're 'going to have to teach me'? Aren't you forgetting your manners?"
517885, "My manners? There are different manners of life and thought, none of them mine. If everything goes awry, you'll get a chance to witness each of them; that is something you should probably try to avoid. As for now, please forgive my rudeness. I'm in a special position here, and so I have the right to be blunt sometimes."
517886, "And who are you?"
517887, "What did you want to tell me?"
517888, "Thank you."
517889, "SAWN-OFF SHOTGUN. A fearsome makeshift weapon, possibly made from a double-barreled hunting gun. The smooth barrels are cut short. Fires 16 gauge shotgun rounds. Deadly in close quarters, but ineffective at long distances. The trigger system allows to fire two shots in a row."
517890, "SHELL. 16 gauge buckshot rounds."
517891, ""
517892, "Why have you come?"
517893, "I will. But that will only prolong the agony."
517894, "Oh, can't you see what you have done... He is in terrible pain..."
517895, "I could easily have been in his place."
517896, "Really? Should I maybe tend to his wounds and sing him a lullaby?"
517897, "Would you want to? Oh, that's wonderful! He's lost a lot of blood, see? He needs more. I'd share mine with him, but it's poisoned... and I've got too little of it, too. So I can't give mine away."
517898, "Is there anyone here that can perform a blood transfusion?"
517899, "I've heard of a terrible man trading in blood in the Stone Yard. He is a usurer, but he takes blood too. He has the skills. Want me to show you where he lives?"
517900, "Okay, have it your way. I'll pay him a visit."

518296, "Restore your reputation. Do that now, and at any other time it becomes too low. People are foolish and weak. One day you're beaten to a pulp and laughed at, the next you're worshipped. As for the third day... well, I think you caught my drift. What I'm saying is, any misdeed can be atoned for, and you'll be loved just as fervently as you were hated."
518297, "How do I restore my reputation?"
518298, "Do good deeds. The town is small-rumours spread like fire, growing hundredfold in the process. And they're spread by children, too, so... Your reputation will be restored. Just don't be wasteful with it, it's fragile."
518299, "What makes it low?"
518300, "The decrease of your reputation depends first and foremost on the number of living beings you've made less than living. It also depends on how you influence the people whose fates are bound to yours. You'll meet those... special people. They're called the Bound sometimes. A silly custom, but a useful one."
518301, "Special people?"
518303, "Thirty or so-each of them possessing their own unique traits. All of them hate one another, all of them are habitual liars... all of them deserve to live. Yet some of them are incompatible-someone has to die so that another may live. And you know what that means."
518304, "How will I recognize these people?"
518305, "That’s not hard. They're striking personalities, locally famous, even though not all of them are of noble descent. Beggars, outcasts, little children even. Bound... to be a bit closer to perfection than the common crowd."
518306, "I see. Thanks for the advice."
518307, "What would you recommend?"
518308, "You'll need a first aid kit to restore your health. Or at least some bandages or tourniquets-they'd stop the bleeding. Painkillers would help you make it even further."
518309, "Is that enough to make it to the evening?"
518310, "You're also hungry, aren't you?"
518311, "Very hungry."
518312, "To be honest, I'm dreadfully tired..."
518313, "You don't have to mug people to sate your hunger. Food can be found in shops... Although your reputation would preclude you from enjoying their hospitality. On the other hand, a whole warehouse of meat was robbed yesterday, when it was unlocked for shipping procedures..."
518314, "If any of the noble townspeople trusts you enough, you can always sleep at their place. Just remember that you're an outlaw for now; the only person who believes you is Vlad Olgimsky. I'll show you where he lives. You can get some sleep at his mansion. Don't forget to apply bandages before that-unless dying in your sleep is the career opportunity of your choice, that is."
518315, "Thank you..."
518316, "Be careful. Dodge strangers. They're afraid of you now and will attack you in a heartbeat. Don't trust anyone. Speak to my fellow Executor. He wanted to have a word with you too."
518317, "Okay."
518318, "I can do without his advice."
518319, "Are you with that... crowd?"
518320, "Aren't you a funny guy."
518321, "If I am to die, so be it."
518322, "No. Of course not. They were but peaceful townspeople. Craftsmen, factory workers, kind sons and good fathers... I'm far more dangerous. I'm the Mask of Fate."
518323, "Some peaceful townspeople... Why did they try to kill me?"
518325, "My friend will explain that."
518326, "So what did you want to tell me?"
518327, "Some. My heart is a bit too soft."
518328, "And what does my fate look like, huh?"
518330, "Oh my... Aren't you a cute little fatalist! Just don't forget to clench your teeth manly when you're saying something like this. Problem is, your teeth have almost been knocked out, so the manliness of the jaw is somewhat lackluster... Being a fatalist is way more fun when you've got several options available, wouldn't you agree?"
518332, "I agree."
518333, "I'm fed up with you. Get lost."
518334, "Where do I get them?"
518335, "You can mug the passers-by or barter with them. Children will gladly trade most valuable things in exchange for what others consider junk. Moreover, our drunkards usually have bandages on them; when you're a drunk, it makes sense to always be prepared for a fight. When they're hungover, however, they'd sell their own sister for a bottle of water. Water is scarce here."
518339, "I'm an outlaw?"
518340, "Where do I get water?"
518341, "There's often some left in the water-barrels; enough to fill an empty bottle if you have one."
518342, "Okay. Go on."
518343, "What's hurt my reputation so much?"
518344, "An unfortuante misunderstanding. I wouldn't be so rash as to call it slander... but it looks very much like it."
518345, "Tell me about it."
518346, "My friend will do it better, that's his part. My job is explaining to you how to keep your body in a working condition."

518732, "Three thousand is enough. That's a good price for human life."
518734, "It's not about anger, and it's a long story anyway. She's a truly special girl... a bad girl, too. You know what I mean? It's a shame they didn't catch her four days ago! I'd spare no expence just make sure the lewd wench is dead!"
518735, "I'll remember these words."
518736, "Was she the person who had brought plague to the town?"
518737, "It's entirely possible... She's not from around here, you know."
518738, "Oh, please do, honey... Everything happens, you know? So if it ever just so happens that you get a chance to assist with the tender bird's death, do keep in mind that I'd pay very generously for that."
518739, "I don't trade in other people's death."
518740, "I'll keep that in mind."
518741, "Do I look like an idiot to you?"
518742, "Okay. If she finds herself in a life-threatening situation, I won't interfere."
518743, "Do you, darling? Not at all... Or would you like to know why I hate her so much? Here you go then: she had ruined someone very dear to me. Does my story make more sense now? If you're looking for the most vicious creature in town, it's her!"
518744, "The conclusion being...?"
518745, "The conclusion being that there's no need for her to live. Perhaps the plague is our punishment for her sins? So keep my words in mind, will you? And do keep in mind that I'm a wealthy person now."
518746, "I will."
518747, "If you want her dead, go and do the killing yourself. It's not that hard."
518748, "How come you know about the state of my affairs?"
518749, "Rumour has it that native Steppe people are actually unlikely to die from the disease-I'm not sure there have been any lethal cases at all. Dancers, butchers... those bull people of yours, what's the word...? That doesn't mean the infection passes them by-but for some reason the disease doesn't seem to reproduce within their bodies. Perhaps it has something to do with their blood."
518750, "Who on earth was so eager to get to me?"
518751, "It feels like the style of the governor. Alexander respects me, so I'll do my best to protect you from any further persecution, but I can't guarantee anything."
518752, "That's fine. I can do without guarantees."
518753, "I've been looking for you."
518755, "Why?"
518756, "I think I know why..."
518757, "We need a sample of infected tissue with a high concentration of the bacteria. A heart would work best. A living one, in fact. No more than half an hour can pass after you extract it, and the donor has to have an early-non-critical-stage of the disease."
518758, "Thank you. That's helpful."
518759, "You are a funny man, oynon. Do you think I walk around cutting people open for my own pleasure?"
518760, "Quite the contrary. I need a heart to make a protective vaccine. I think it would serve our common interests."
518761, "Who is 'we'?"
518762, "Doctor Rubin and I. You are well aware that we're working on a vaccine that will provide Sand Plague immunity. I need the microbial culture for that."
518763, "Why can't you just take any infected blood?"
518764, "The bacteria die or become unreasonably weakened as soon as they're extracted from their nutrient medium; we need to find a way to capture the disease at an active stage. Doctor Rubin's experiments with... a subject... have shown that the heart is the medium where the bacteria reproduce most actively."
518765, "Why a heart? Why not something else?"
518766, "What does that mean?"
518768, "I'll do it if you pay for the heart."
518769, "I'm trying to make a panacea. A serum. A very different thing."
518772, "I need the disease itself. You need the useful antibodies produced by a living being. I think both can be found within the same medium-the blood of a person infected, but not yet devoured by the plague. The antibodies suppressing the bacteria's development are precisely the reason for that person to not having been devoured yet."
518773, "How much do you want?"
518774, "Fifteen thousand."
518775, "Ten thousand is the sweet spot."
518776, "I don't have that kind of money. In all honesty, it never occurred to me that you may want to set up an exotic meat shop..."
518777, "Farewell then."
518778, "How much can you pay?"
518779, "How much would you offer?"
518780, "I'll give you everything I have except for the little I can't do without."
518781, "Fine."
518782, "So what kind of heart do you need?"
518783, "Do you really think, oynon, that people can fight the Sand Plague?"
518784, "Sounds vague."
518785, "Don't worry, I won't try to swindle you. I always keep my word. You'll be pleased."
518786, "So what kind of heart do you need?"
518787, "All right. Will any heart do? Or do you have preferences?"
518788, "No deal."
518789, "But you can profit personally from this. You haven't forgotten your obligations, I hope?"
518790, "I haven't. What's your point?"
518791, "I can fulfil my obligations on my own. Goodbye."
518792, "You won't find any butchers in the town. Everyone who had escaped the Termitary has fled."
518793, "Not every single one; as far as I know, someone is still being harboured by certain sharp-tongued lady. Her name is Aspity. You can also find dancers in the pub, but the pub is Andrey Stamatin's domain-hell if he allows you to open any of them up in front of him... The dancers may go out for a walk from time to time though, right?"
518794, "Find yourself another aide, oynon. I'm not helping you."
518795, "The first statement is true. As for the rest..."
518796, "Yes, I am Burakh."
518797, "Have you come to open my flesh up along the Ragi line?"
518798, "No."
518799, "What do you mean?"
518800, "Your time has not come yet."
518801, "The Steppe loves me and grants me herbs. I can call white whip with my songs, and brown twyre is lured by the warmth of my breath. Black twyre is abundant if I give my juices to the earth in winter."
518802, "No problem. I will feed the Steppe with their blood."
518804, "Then please make those butchers go away! They've already made the decision to kill me. But none of them knows the Ragi line. They just want to cut me to get a bucketful of blood."
518805, "To get your blood? Why would they do that?"
518806, "Don't worry. No one will lay a finger on you."
518807, "Will twyre become rarer if you die?"
518808, "Of course it will. Now and forever. I wanted to give birth to a daughter in nine years so that she'd take my warmth and become a Bride in my stead. I am the only one to call herbs out of Suok's gut until then. Don't kill me, please... I will be of more use to you alive..."
518809, "I'm not so sure about that. Let them take their blood, and I will take something else. You are about to come back to the earth; prepare yourself."
518810, "You will live. Calm down."
518811, "Not so good lately. My lips are always dry, my tongue rough. I have to drink a lot. Why do you ask? Can you help me?"
518812, "Yes, I can release you from suffering."
518813, "Wait! Someone is going to come here soon, he's a doctor, perhaps he can help me..."
518815, "You mean the Bachelor?"
518816, "Yes, the Bachelor! He needs me. Don't you lay a finger on me or you'll make him very upset..."
518818, "I'm afraid you're sick, Willow."
518819, "Okay, you two sort things out yourselves then."
518820, "And so he will be upset. Prepare to die."
518821, "Do you think I'm a carrier? No, that's not true... I've been in a crowded place all the time, people saw me! You know how quickly the Sand Plague spreads, the pub would have become a mass tomb in no time."
518822, "Have you been... with anyone recently?"
518823, "Why do you ask? Well, yes... Of course."
518824, "Are they in good health?"
518825, "I don't know. I haven't seen any of them since then... None of them have come back to the den. That doesn't mean they are dead though, does it? There are plenty of reasons to avoid public places these days..."
518826, "I doubt that. Prepare to die."
518827, "Fine. Live ahead. Let this one remain on the Bachelor's conscience."
518828, "I never waste breath saying things I don't mean."
518829, "My lines have brought me to a bloody path..."
518830, "Oh... You are looking for your Sacrifice, aren't you? I know. How can I help you?"
518831, "I need a butcher."
518832, "That's a weird thing for you to say. Do you really think that your father had such a worthless creature in mind? You're looking in the wrong place. A butcher is but a man. Why concern yourself with men?"
518834, "I need him for other purposes."
518835, "Will you tell me?"
518836, "You know that I'm making a panacea... I need the tissue of one of the Boddho's children."
518837, "No. You are to follow blindly. Your curiosity is unnecessary."
518838, "What a ridiculous idea! It's not my place to judge what the elder families do, but you are a different case. You didn't grow up here, you only came back recently. I fear you've fallen under the Bachelor's influence-the prickly prick that'll bury us all! There's no way in hell I'm going to help him... or his minions."
518839, "Yet you are going to help me."
518840, "No, Burakh. I'm no fool. I can see the Bachelor standing behind your back. It is he who needs the panacea, not you. He wants to offer it to the Powers That Be along with someone's head-that is the price of his victory. You should find your own path."
518841, "Don't you judge my actions, woman. I follow the lines of my father's will."
518842, "Pity."
518843, "All right. What do you want to know?"
518844, "I want to know where to find a butcher."
518845, "You can't. You are too worthless a creature."
518846, "Whoa... I never expected to hear something like that from you. You are throwing me away too early... Even a mouse managed to help a panther once. But the choice is, of course, yours."
518847, "That was rude of me. I apologize."
518848, "Yes. The choice is mine, and I will make it."
518849, "You might as well open one of the Worms or a Bride dancer, that would be of more use... And have you tried getting into the Termitary?"
518850, "I have. It's impossible-and I'm very short on time."
518851, "I see... It is indeed not my place to judge. Do you want me to show you where the butchers are hiding?"
518852, "I don't even want to try. Dying would be too simple an out for me right now."
518853, "Yes."
518854, "Which gatherer did they go to?"
518855, "That I do not know. But I think they're not interested in the gatherers themselves-they rather have business with the Herb Bride that lives with them. I do not know or care which one she's living with these days."
518856, "Okay, I'll look for them."
518857, "Obey me? Why?"
518858, "I am a dancer, you see. It's a very special trade, an ancient trade. The Rite is obligatory for us-even more so than for butchers."
518859, "What does your trade have to do with religion?"
518860, "Are you joking, Burakh? A dancer knows the lines. Only a dancer can bend and extend them-it's a sacred art. These days we're not dancing because of the mourning... But when happier days come, you will see how far we can extend the lines of body."
518861, "I hope happier days come very soon."
518862, "Only one. The one that was ripped apart and burnt at the Bone Stake four days ago. Why do you ask? And what's that look you're giving me..."
518863, "Why did the crowd kill that girl?"
518864, "She emerged from an infected house-the one that was later visited by torchmen, you know the one. They say your father, old Isidor, used to work there. So they asked her what business she had there. She said she had brought your father a word and a deed. Everyone expected her to die very quickly, but she didn't."
518865, "I'm asking because I'm very much surprised that you do not get sick."
518866, "Oh, but we do! You can't imagine how many of us died during the First Outbreak! And butchers too... That was a few years ago. It's just that we have more options. The disease leaves us quickly if we're not seriously infected. If we are, however, then we die..."
518867, "Shouldn't they have been happy...?"
518868, "Why do you think it works like that?"
518869, "...Then the townsfolk decided she was to blame for everything. Called her a carrier. And then the rumour spread of a shabnack-adyr coming from below the ground, and so they broke her lines and burnt her at the Bone Stake. But it was a wrong thing to do. Even if she was sick, she couldn't infect anyone else."
518870, "How come?"
518871, "Do you know what Brides are? The Brides who are engaged to the Earth; the Brides who summon twyre."
518872, "No."
518873, "Yes, I do."
518874, "They are no Mistresses, of course... Compared to a Mistress, even a young one, they're merely candles next to a bonfire. They do have powers, however, and impressive powers at that. Brides say that their-that our juices flow in such a fashion that we can do no harm. Our bodies are clean."
518875, "What do you mean by that?"
518876, "If there's not too much Sand Dirt in our bodies, it leaves them quickly. And we can't infect anyone at all, that much is certain. If the Dirt is abundant, however, then it devours us just like any other person, and there's nothing to be done about that."
518877, "I see. Would you like to come with me?"
518878, "I'd like to...! But I can't. I have to stay here until the evening-and I do have plans for that time. A handsome guest in a snakeskin coat has arranged to meet me in the Blind Backyard."
518879, "Is that so... I think I know who the happy man is."
518880, "Seems like you are blessed with a great metabolism-who could have thought metabolism is a thing that can depend on the social status. See you later."
518881, "Too bad."
518882, "Don't worry about him. We really are harmless. As a Burakh, you ought to feel it."
518883, "I do feel it, relax."
518884, "The Blind Backyard, eh...? When exactly?"
518885, "Nine o'clock. I'll probably come earlier though, I want to have some me time first."
518887, "It will. I am positive that there are antibodies to be found in the bodies of Steppe people. Unless they have natural immunity, that is-which sounds unlikely."
518888, "Okay. Double-checking time: please tell me what you need precisely."
518889, "Sure. As far as I understand, almost every townsperson here has a trace of Steppe blood in them, but there's also an ethnic layer that's been completely untouched by civilization. I'm talking about that Kin of yours. I'm not sure who exacltly belongs to it-I only know that dancers and butchers do. Try one of them."
518891, "Isn't that the usurer's daughter?"
518892, "I don't know."
518893, "Perhaps. She'll be waiting for someone in the evening. In the Blind Backyard."
518894, "Don't touch Willow, Burakh! You will ruin my plans. Take anyone else."
518895, "What, does the whole town know this? Is she telling everyone about her plans?"
518896, "She's not the quiet type, that's for sure."
518897, "What if she's the only option?"
518898, "All right then..."
518899, "...Then do it. The vaccine is more important than a single life. But I'm seriously asking you to try every other option before you go through with this."
518900, "Deal."
518901, "So a profitable deal of yours have fallen through, I gather?"
518902, "That's not the point. The town has lost a usurer and acquired a disruptive gang leader-Grief and Barley pale in comparison to this. I wonder where all his madmen came from... Must be his debtors."
518903, "I don't understand."
518904, "They want to burn the town down. We'll have to deal with a firestarter gang from now on. I have a really bad feeling about this..."
518905, "Right. So do you need the heart or what? The clock's ticking."
518906, "Yes, of course I do. I hope it wasn't for nothing."
518907, "Take revenge? How?"
518910, "No, I'm not."
518911, "Well. Peace be with her."
518912, "I'm not, but I didn't have much of a choice."
518913, "Yes, I know that already. Bloody Aspity did her best to sneak each and every one of them out into the Steppe. Haven't seen a creature more repulsive in my entire life! Every quarantine measure we've taken will prove useless if any of them reaches civilization."
518914, "They are not contagious, oynon."
518915, "Oh really? How do you know? If the bacteria live within their bodies undeveloped, they are very much contagious! They are walking carriers!"
518916, ""
518917, "The patrolmen aren't running out of legs, are they..."
518918, "They get their job done."
518919, "Are you the boss here?"
518920, "You could say so, Ripper."
518921, "I don't like being called that. You better keep it in mind."
518922, "You're the one who needs me, not the other way round. And so you will speak my tongue. I'm not the one who needs you."
518923, "I need one of these women."
518924, "You've got strong muscles and a good reaction. You must be an excellent fighter. But I will kill you if we ever fight. Get it?"
518925, "Well, I can do without you as well."
518926, "......"
518927, "You got it, I see. You can call me Haruspex."
518928, "They're not for sale. Neither are they take-away-especially now. They are very dear to me. I'm getting more and more sentimental by the day."
518929, "The words you're using are way too big for someone like me."
518930, "I need to talk to them."
518931, "Fine by me. Talk ahead."
518932, "Thanks."
518933, "To hell with you kids. Getting into your business was a bad idea..."
518934, "I do."
518935, "Damn! Should have taken one from Sticky. I thought it would be standing all ajar... I wonder why it isn't. Have the Soul-and-a-Halves locked it or something?"
518936, "Okay, I'll take care of it. Thanks for bringing me here."
518937, "What about my tip, uncle man?"
518938, "Get outta here..."
518939, "You'll get your reward if I come back alive."
518940, "Keep quiet."
518941, "Right... You know what? Go ahead and keep all the weapons to yourself-I'll find myself some more."
518942, "I am."
518943, "It's sharing time then. Fifty-fifty, remember? I want a revolver! The rest is yours-I don’t mind."
518944, "No, pal. I'm not giving you any weapons-you'll only get yourself in trouble with them. But I'll find a way to thank you later."
518945, "You may take it all if you like. I can manage well enough with my bare hands."
518946, "I knew it! C'mon, be a good man, give it to me..."
518947, "No. I won't."
518948, "All right. But only when I'm absolutely sure that the barbers are all dead."
518949, "A wise choice."
518950, "Are they correct?"
518951, "Cor-wrecked! C'mon. Notkin's just angry because I refused to join him when he wanted me to. Khan has no special liking of me eigher... I've done them both favours. I've even climbed a chimney for them! And all those pricks do is boss about... Well, let them just wait and see!"
518952, "And they're planning to mug the muggers, right?"
518953, "Hello there! Living under a rock or what? The angry guys that split off from Grief's gang to cut people on the streets. 'We ain't listenin' to ya no more,' they said, 'the Kin's gone, the old life's blasted, so we ain't got nothin' to lose!' Big words, huh? And so they went slashing and robbing everyone. Those sons of bitches..."
518954, "And so your friends are planning to attack them?"
518955, "They ain't no friends of mine! Arrogant bastards, stinky turncoats... Ooh, I hate them... What did I do to them?"
518956, "That's not an answer."
518957, "Big deal... Don't be silly, just take care of yourself. It'll be all right."
518958, "Well yeah, they are. As if they'd have a shot at it. They planned on arming up-got them weapons stored at a certain place... Well, I'm gonna ruin their party! How about we snatch their weapons away? And we'll save the dumbheads from the barbers' knives as well..."
518959, "Why not. Where is the place?"
518960, "I don't have time for this."
518962, "Are you Stump? 'Busybody' is the word. I'll be the one to escort you instead of Sticky."
518963, "Ah! Well done, Sticky. 'Cause, y'know... people say it's dangerous out there. These jerks have gone absolutely mental, they're running rampant! I'd put a knife or two into them if I could, too. Come on, follow me."
518965, "I will accept it if you tell me the truth."
518966, "I wonder why."
518967, "You are being hunted? I didn't know that."
518968, "I'm forced into hiding, as you can see. The only reason I've come here is because the barbers have wounded a person that I owe a debt. I'm an outlaw on the run now. And I deserve it way more than you..."
518969, "What have you done?"
518970, "Most likely-considering your recent attitude."
518971, "That's no laughing matter. I have wronged you."
518972, "There was no doubt in my mind that it was you who had killed the Master, until recently. He was obviously killed for the inheritance. It was connected to the Kin admitting the spiritual leadership rights of the Burakhs for the second time. And there is other evidence that... fit together to support the assumption."
518973, "What evidence?"
518974, "Firstly, the wound. The thing they're calling a shabnak's claw had inflicted too precise a wound. A wound following every rule of the 'secret line', as though the criminal had an intimate knowledge of the inner ways. No butcher could make a blow like that. Secondly, the news of your arrival..."
518975, "It's all gotten so confusing. I've been told a strange story not so long ago. I think you are being hunted for something that I had done. For Simon Kain."
518976, "Who told you I was to come shortly?"
518977, "Katerina Saburova. Alexander is the governor now. Beware of him."
518978, "What did Katerina Saburova say about me?"
518979, "Am I being hunted on his order?"
518980, "No. The order is Georgiy Kain's. And he is even more dangerous than Alexander."
518981, "What have I done to upset him?"
518982, "The reason being...?"
518984, "She said you were coming. Said you would spend your first days here in secrecy. That you are to make a bloody sacrifice."
518985, "Not much then. Did you believe her?"
518986, "Of course I did. How could I not? She even said that you will 'drown the town in blood', 'quench the earth's thirst for blood', or 'start a bloodshed'. That is literally what she said."
518987, "That could have been said as a metaphor."
518988, "Yes... Those guys that have been working around this place have shed more blood in one day than one could imagine!"
518989, "Well, I'll speak to her."
518993, "I don't understand."
518994, "Yes, I've heard that Simon has beed killed."
518995, "You've been attacked, remember? At the Station. They were there on their own accord, I've learned. Tried to ambush Simon's murderer. Thought he would try to escape by hiding in a carriage when a scheduled train arrives."
518996, "What does that have to do with us? I thought oynon Dankovsky had established the truth. Simon's killer is still among us. And we can't punish them yet."
518997, "And so we are hunted by fanatics for desecrating Simon's remains. Well, unlike you, I deserve it. When I realized the nature of his superhuman blood, I had a desperate decision to make. And I've decided to make Sand Plague medicine from Simon's remains."
518998, "Why didn't you explain yourself? Your choice would've been accepted."
518999, "Like hell it would! Explaining myself to the Kains is pointless. They've fetishized Simon! They'd rather place their bets on his sacred power, or the power of his name, or hell knows what else. They are a family of high-handed esoterics who only believe in dark arts!"
519000, "Have you looked for antibodies in his blood?"
519001, "'Fetishized'? What does that mean?"
519002, "Where have you been all these years? I thought you were studying."
519003, "I'm kidding. Just didn't expect a word like this to escape your lips. Go on."
519004, "That was the first thing I did. There was nothing of the sort. I am a sceptic, you know. Yet each time I come across the Kains' mysticism, I am filled with fear. It's like the disease began to wither away within him, all on its own... but it didn't die."
519005, "So what are you planning to do to him?"
519006, "I'm not planning. The deed's been already done. The sacrilege is complete. I've cut his body open by every line, and squeezed everything I could from it. I pulled the bacteria from it and have made a few protective vaccine samples already. Old Simon has fed mankind with himself once again."
519007, "Can I count on you?"
519008, "That depends on what you're planning to do."
519009, "'All on its own'? What do you mean?"
519010, "His blood is of a completely different nature to anything I've seen before. It isn't quite human. More than human, I'd say... In any case, the blood is gone. I used every drop to make the vaccines. I don't regret it though; it wouldn't have helped you anyway, I think."
519011, "Okay. Thank you for the news."
519012, "I'm sorry I can't be of more use. And don't harbour ill feelings against me, please."
519013, "I don't like blind hatred, Stakh."
519014, "Are you telling the truth? Look me in the eye."
519015, "I did kill... But I had my own reasons to. I'm a killer, not a murderer."
519016, "I haven't killed a single person, I promise."
519017, "...Not only are you a murderer, but also a liar! The former is horrible, but the latter is despicable. I don't want to speak to you, go away."
519018, "You idiot."
519019, "Can't we be friends at all?"
519020, "Well... We all do bad things, so we must right our wrongs with the good deeds. The worse the original deed, the more good we must do."
519021, "Tell me where can I find this man that I'm looking for."
519022, "I won't tell you anything. Go away."
519023, "Aren't you going to listen to me at all?"
519024, "What do I have to do to restore my good name in your eyes?"
519025, "You hurt people. Now, save a few diseased ones from the pain."
519026, "Okay, I'll do as you ask."
519027, "Painkillers aren't that easy to find. I have better uses for them."
519028, "So you've softened your heart, haven't you?"
519029, "I shouldn't have thought so badly of you. If only you knew how horrible the rumours surrounding you are, you wouldn't be so harsh on me..."
519030, "What rumours?"
519031, "I'm not being harsh on you at all."
519032, "They say you cut human bodies to express yourself."
519033, "Many people do just that. Those who can't muster up the courage to cut others resort to cutting themselves. That's barbaric."
519034, "They say a body is like a tight knot for you-a knot you're longing to untie. That you see knots instead of people around you when walking along the street!"
519035, "That's not true."
519036, "What's the point of untying them without need? Knots are only untied when you need loose rope to connect the disjointed."
519037, "They say you make human sacrifices, but refuse to believe in heathen gods."
519038, "The inexplicable is always frightening. I'm surprised you're not scared by the people that kill out of greed or anger."
519039, "That doesn't mean every single knot is supposed to be untied."
519040, "I wish I'd catch the person spreading the rumours. They'll make a perfect sacrifice for some worthless deity. I'd do it by the rite, too!"
519041, "It is your good luck that I know where he is. But what do you need him for? You want to take vengeance on him?"
519042, "What for?"
519043, "He threatened to punish you. He believes that it was you who killed Isidor. He's... he's wrong though, isn't he?"
519044, "Of course he is."
519045, "So why do you need him?"
519046, "And what do you think?"
519047, "Oh, I don't know what to believe!"
519048, "Whatever the case, Rubin is a man that can stand up for himself. So where is he?"
519049, "I'm making a panacea-and so does he. I want to know if he's had any luck."
519050, "I want to talk to him. About my father's death, for one."
519051, "Your face is terrifying... No, I can't tell you. I don't think you're up to any good."
519052, "Whatever, I'll find him without your help."
519053, "Fine, Lara. I'm making a remedy that helps with the Sand Plague. I need his advice."
519054, "Can you promise me that you'll never reveal his hideout to anyone? Can you swear on your father's memory?"
519055, "I can."
519056, "No. I won't swear on my father's memory."
519057, "Your fear speaks for itself. I won't reveal to you where he is."
519058, "As you wish."
519059, "I do. I'm tired of his moronic spite."
519060, "There was a curious sample by his microscope. I've taken a look, but I'm not sure what I saw."
519066, "So who can this be?"
519067, "Rubin is the only person who can answer that question, I'm afraid. We should hurry and find him before his persecutors do. I would even be willing to break my word for that. But you said he's not in his prosectorium, right?"
519068, "No, he is not."
519069, "Perhaps he is back by now."
519070, "I think Yulia and Lara keep in touch with him... or rather he keeps in touch with them. Perhaps they know something. Try to get to Lara while I'm analyzing this sample."
519071, "You are one stubborn oynon."
519072, "Don't forget to get a sample from him."
519073, "Do you have a plan?"
519074, "Master Rubin, who doesn't trust me and is concealing something important, has an unusual source of infected tissue. He's using it to conduct his first experiments. It is not a vaccine, of course, but it's something. I think it might be of interest to you as well."
519075, "You have my attention."
519076, "Seems like Rubin is working with a mysterious carrier of the disease that has weakened microbial culture in their blood. I doubt we could make a vaccine from it-your reagents seem to deal with it all too mercilessly. I wonder what had weakened the infection though..."
519077, "Disaster is a big word."
519078, "An appropriate one. I couldn't extract living bacteria, and this little... muck that it leaves behind in dead bodies is of no use... Not to mention that there are no antibodies. But I'm not losing hope."
519079, "Why not?"
519080, "What's your vaccine-making process?"
519081, "Oh, this out-of-the-way hole-pardon me once again for saying so-knows only one process. The microbial culture is treated with natural agents so that it adapts... Well, Rubin treats it, I test the results. You know all this though, don't you?"
519082, "Why is obtaining living bacteria so important?"
519083, "Because the purpose of a vaccine is to give the organism a chance to develop immunity. To teach it how to fight the infection. It's obvious! I wonder how a strong and healthy organism would react to these... bacterial experiments?"
519084, "Yeah, it won't fight. It'll probably just reject the sample."
519085, "I know how vaccines work, I'm not an idiot. I just wanted to double-check if you're positive there are no antibodies in dead tissue."
519086, "I know all this better than you do. See you later."
519087, "You and Rubin are working on a vaccine. What does it have to do with me? I'm not trying to extract the bacteria."
519088, "Most certainly. But we ought to look further."
519089, "Where?"
519090, "You need the antibodies though, don't you? Just listen to me before you refuse my advice."
519091, "I'm listening."
519092, "Who is the carrier?"
519093, "Beats me. Rubin is keeping tantalizingly mum about the whole business. You're closer to him than I am, though; perhaps he'd be willing to share with you the information that he is concealing from me."
519094, "Rubin hates me."
519095, "He absolutely doesn't. Last time we talked, I described your feats in detail and proved that his suspicions were completely baseless. You're his hero now, and he's deeply ashamed of his tantrum."
519096, "Where do I find him?"
519097, "That is something I cannot tell you. I gave my word."
519098, "What? This makes no sense."
519099, "This shadowy scheming and double-dealing is absurd. I have no need for cardboard excuses. Have a nice day."
519100, "Telling me would be in your best interests though, wouldn't it?"
519101, "Sating your curiosity is not in my best interests, no. Rubin shares his findings with me-and for me that's enough. Even if the microbes turn out to have come from his own saliva, I don't care. You are the one who does."
519102, "Rubin's trust is very precious to me-and it's so very fragile. If he finds out that it was I who told you where his lair is-a lair that's being actively sought after by numerous armed robbers, I must add-I will lose a very important ally. No way. You're free to look for Rubin yourself."
519103, "I won't ever abuse this knowledge. I can give you my word."
519104, "Okay. How did you manage to find him?"
519105, "And where do I start?"
519106, "I was introduced to him by a lovely lady called Lara Ravel. She is a very kind, gentle creature. I suppose it would be very hard to be accepted as her guest without a stellar reputation, but you'll probably fight your way in somehow."
519107, "I see where you're going with this. It's this thing people call a 'joke', right?"
519108, "Sounds like too much fuss. I'll handle it myself."
519109, "What are you doing, my good people?"
519110, "Stay out of it, you nutjob! Or you'll taste my knife all right..."
519111, "You shouldn't have said that. Here it comes!"
519112, "All right, calm down now, all right! I'm going..."
519113, "We ain't no good people, and we sure as hell ain't yours. Gotta pick them dirty punks' noses with our knives! They're showin' off a lil' bit too much, y'see, them jackanapeses. Did Bad Grief send you?"
519114, "Maybe he did, maybe he didn't..."
519115, "Were you?"
519116, "Y'know what, get lost then before we peel your face off your skull!"
519117, "Oh my... That was colourful. Eat this!"
519118, "All right, calm down now, all right! I'm going..."
519119, "Unmount your ambush, you unshaven scum."
519120, "What the hell're you babblin' about here, tailcove?"
519121, "'Agathay onay ethay ogothpay'. Got it, tailcove? Now ready, set, go. I want to see your heels flashing."
519122, "Eat this, you asshole! Who do you think you're calling a 'tailcove'...."
519123, "We'll meet again, cheeky face..."
519124, "Hope so."
519125, "How about we sort it out right here, assface?"
519126, "Parley, parley..."
519127, "Take this weapon. It's handmade. Granddad said it used to be a fowling piece... Well, the hammer's different and the barrel has been somewhat modified. It can use rifle ammo or shot cartridges. Know where to get those?"
519128, "Calm down. I will do you no harm."
519129, "And where are the crooks? How did they let you through?"
519130, "It's all right. They are no more."
519131, "They're dead. All of them."
519132, "Cool! Did you do that all by yourself...?"
519133, "All by myself."
519134, "Would you look at him! Listen, this means we ought to thank you somehow..."
519135, "It would help."
519136, "Who do you children think you're dealing with? Have you lost your marbles?"
519137, "Watch your tongue! We ain't no children. We are Soul-and-a-Halves! And there's more than enough of us back home. Multiply that by two too 'cause our pets fight alongside us. We are a force to be reckoned with."
519138, "Well, the guys by the door weren't exactly trembling with fear."
519139, "Whaddya want? What? We won't give up our dogs! We'll fight back!"
519140, "What dogs?"
519141, "Well, don't give them up then. Your choice."
519142, "So you aren't a thief?"
519143, "No. I'm not a thief and you know it."
519144, "I'm joking. Aren't you a bit young for knife fights?"
519145, "What pets?"
519146, "Our Halves. The thieves hate them. They hate them all: dogs, cats, crows, owls, rats. Especially dogs!"
519147, "Is that why they were waiting for you by the entrance?"
519148, "No thank you. Farewell. And don't go about looking for trouble anymore."
519149, "Help me out here."
519150, "Ammo is rare. It can be found here and there... Always in small quantities. We've ordered our girls to go out looking for it. You could ask them! They will probably trade ammo and cartriges for their girly treasures..."
519151, "I'll figure it out, thank you."
519152, "Great Mother! Does it shoot at all?"
519153, "It does, but you have to find suitable ammo."
519154, "And what ammo is suitable?"
519155, "Obviously."
519156, "I think it will do better in my hands than in yours."
519157, "Maybe I am. Want to help out?"
519158, "That depends on what you're up to."
519159, "I'm up to a good thing. My Soul-and-a-Halves are sneaking about everywhere-watching out for enemy Dogheads, catching Halves, and just generally messing around. So I want to use them for the greater good. Even Sticky will turn green with envy."
519160, "What kind of greater good?"
519161, "Who is Sticky?"
519162, "Just a bloke. Thinks he's the sharpest. Likes to stick his nose everywhere, won't miss anything fun for the life of him. The more dangerous, the better. Quite above himself too... Wouldn't join our gang... Eh, why are we even talking about him!"
519163, "What do you want to talk about then?"
519164, "We will scout out which houses have been infected. We'll make a map of them every day. Imagine that! If it goes well, the Bachelor himself will happily trade his right arm for such a map!"
519165, "Interesting. Will you show me?"
519166, "We can even make a copy for you if you want. Can you do us a favour in return?"
519167, "How many?"
519168, "Give us ten protective mixtures, and the map is yours. And don't you think I'm being greedy-I just need the infusions to equip the scouts with."
519169, "I agree. We have a deal."
519170, "No. It's a hard task that would take too much time."
519171, "Hardly. Unless someone lends you a hand..."
519174, "What kind of favour?"
519175, "Your father knew some awesome rare recipes for twyrine infusions. He wrote down the ones that protected from the Sand Plague after the First Outbreak. Can you make them?"
519177, "He landed himself in a soup with some bandits."
519178, "Is that because of the Halves? I must have heard about it! Grief demanded they get rid of their wardogs! Were they defending their cubs?"
519179, "Yes, most likely."
519180, "Well done, Notkin! Don't you think he would pick a quarrel over nothing..."
519181, "How did he manage to settle so close to a bandits' den anyway?"
519182, "He had a quarrel... with another boy. Khan. Khan is a brave boy as well, and very high-handed, too. They used to be best friends. Now Khan lives in the Polyhedron and the proud Notkin struggles among bandits in a small hut at the Warehouses... It's a long story. How can I thank you?"
519184, "I don't need anything. Helping you makes me happy already."
519185, "Calm down. He's fine."
519186, "Thank you... What did you do to the bandits?"
519187, "I killed them. I had to."
519188, ".......But you have helped Notkin. Would you please allow me to thank you?"
519189, "No. I don't need anything."
519191, "Castle?"
519192, "It's by the southern Warehouses. That is where the Soul-and-a-Halves-that's what they're calling themselves-live. He is not an urchin, he is just... independent and parentless. And he is getting out of hand. Maybe you could go and check on him? What if he is indeed in danger?"
519193, "A 'pit'? What's that?"
519194, "Well... That is what Maria and I call our visions. She calls hers a 'flight', I call mine a 'pit'. That's peculiar because mine are usually joyful, while hers are grim. Or maybe it's just me. So will you check on Notkin?"
519195, "How do I find them?"
519196, "Sorry, I'm too busy."
519197, "Will he keep it?"
519198, "I've seen his eyes. He's the type that always keeps their word."
519199, "I don't know."
519200, "Well, you dunno, I dunno, nothin' to talk about then. Ain't nothin' to look at here, Burakh."
519201, "Damn...."
519202, "What does it mean?"
519203, "What it means is our thieves' talk, and you ain't got nothin' to do with it. So stop bein' smart and go. They'll do what you tell 'em to."
519204, "Hope so."
519205, "Whaddya think I am, some kind of kid-killin' monster? Even though the lil' punks re nasty, so so nasty... No. I only ordered for the rabid dogs to be taken away from 'em. They're getting' out of hand."
519206, "Maybe you aren't a monster, but the people you've sent came with their knives sharpened."
519207, "...To scare 'em a tiny lil' bit, perhaps?"
519208, "Or perhaps not, Grief? How about ordering your thieves to leave? The times are tough, you know, it's no child's play... Rats are more dangerous than dogs these days."
519209, "Yes, I must have got it wrong. I'll be going then."
519210, "He'll ask me what the matter is."
519211, "The most profitable ever, you answer. Nobody will ever lay a finger on him here, we ain't no enemies to ourselves. You believe me?"
519212, "I do. I'll bring him over."
519213, "No. I don't believe you."
519214, ""
519215, "Most honoured master Burakh! Or rather oynon Burakh. You will be called that soon... for you are the keeper of knowledge. A warden, a menkhu... a surgeon, so to say. And even more than that. So, have you looked into the matter of your inheritance?"
519216, "I have. Nothing is more important for me right now."
519217, "My daughter told me about these... doomed children that the deceased used to... take care of. I see no point in hiding the truth from you. The brand this... mysterious subject is marked with belongs to the secret steppe code. Can you read Longmark? The so-called 'circles or copious brands'?"
519218, "No."
519219, "You've been away for a while... Pray forgive me... Yes, you were but a child when you left... Longmark is a kind of alphabet. The signs that the bulls were branded with. Each of them has many meanings. Each sign is a song. A magical story told in lines. A spell."
519220, "Yes, I see what you mean."
519221, "I don't know this secret code. The Kin does. Maybe some of the odongh Worms or the butchers... And I have to admit, it is me who stands between you and these secrets. I've locked up all inhabitants of the Termitary."
519222, "Why?"
519223, "Pray forgive me...! The're an epidemic. A quarantine. I cannot violate it. There are about eight thousands inside. What if the disease finds a way in?"
519224, "What if it already has?"
519225, "Most respected Bachelor Dankovskiy... has already harassed me with these pointless questions. If the disease is already inside, then there's all the more reason to keep the doors shut. But enough about that. I want to help you. You want to know the meaning of the brand, don't you?"
519226, "I do."
519227, "A few butchers managed to escape the Termitary before it was blocked off. I propose a deal. I've explained to you how you may find them helpful, so you will be looking for them anyway. After you find them, tell me where they are. If you promise to do so, I'll tell you where to start."
519228, "I agree."
519229, "I am no snitch."
519230, "I'm not going to kill them. I must keep an eye on them, however. Don't you realize? Can't you see what's going on? Any possible carrier of the disease has to be isolated! Moreover, mind your obligation..."
519231, "Fine. You've convinced me."
519232, "No."
519233, "There is a shack... I've tried sending people over there already, they were greeted coldly. A certain lady lives in it... She is always in the loop; she knows the butchers' ways and what they're after. They say she was begotten by an odongh and a twyre bride... Start off there. She will treat you with respect."
519234, "How come?"
519235, "Well... You're Isidor Burakh's son. The eldest Burakh now. It means a lot to them that you are from a menkhu family. Menkhu aren't just surgeons or butchers; they are healers. An almost sacred role... a spiritual one, so to say. All in all, the lady will honor your request and tell you about the runaways."
519236, "Well... if that is enough, I'm going. Show me the place."
519237, "A bride?"
519238, "The gatherers... They've got these virgins, these so-called 'twyre brides'. They claim to chase the herbs from below the ground and onto the surface. You're supposed to know this, aren't you? In any case, they do know you. They acted as midwives when you were born..."
519239, "Is that so?"
519240, "I can deal with my inheritance myself."
519241, "An ill-judged reply. Or maybe you do know the meaning of the brand you've found inside the stash?"
519242, "So it's a brand! How come you know about it?"
519244, "You mean the hieroglyphic alphabet?"
519245, "A cruel decision."
519246, "So, what was it that you wanted to tell me?"
519247, "I'm glad you are still alive."
519248, "I want to speak to Foreman Oyun. Can you arrange that?"
519249, "I had to work hard to stay that way."
519250, "Wha-at? What Oyun? Why... with the Foreman? What Foreman? The current one?"
519251, "Yes. The current one, Oyun."
519252, "Why so anxious all of a sudden?"
519253, "Have the Mistresses told you about him? Yeah, I've lost one friend called Burakh already, and Foreman Oyun knows why... yes. He will pay for it... Anyway, I don't want to lose another."
519254, "He knows who killed my father?"
519255, "Does he... He knows all right. Allow me to say I'm pretty sure he's not unhappy about your father's death... Oyun, that is. He wouldn't be unhappy if you were to die either. No, there's no reason for you to meet him right now."
519256, "What do the Mistresses have to do with it? It's just rumours."
519257, "It's just rubbish, Artemy Burakh. You needn't meet him, not right now anyway."
519258, "I cannot agree with you."
519259, "Fine."
519260, "I want to see him."
519261, "What does he know?"
519262, "I haven't spoken to him yet. We'll have some extreme interrogation when he's back."
519263, "He went off to the Steppe. He's not in town at the moment. I think he's supposed to come back in a day or two."
519264, "Where is he now?"
519265, "When did he leave?"
519266, "Three days ago. Or maybe four. Exactly on the eve of your arrival, master Burakh."
519267, "So will you arrange for us to meet?"
519268, "I see."
519269, "The're a plot being woven against me. The Bachelor is nosing about the Termitary and the Abattoir... If I meet the Foreman, I'll give him another reason to suspect me... It'll all be fine, it will all settle... in time. But I wouldn't be so keen on meeting him if I were you."
519270, "That is for me to decide."
519271, "Thank you for the advice."

519276, "I can imagine. You're looking for the runaway. Oh, it's such a shame that Fat Vlad managed to weasel his way into your circle of friends! That friendship will do you no good, oh no... But you're too late anyway. An outsider fop, a bachelor in a snakeskin coat, came by poking his nose everywhere. I've lead the runaway butchers into the Steppe. Otherwise he'd have shot them all dead."
519277, "Are they all gone?"
519278, "Does he have firearms?"
519279, "I think so-else he wouldn't be so confident as to attack butchers. He isn't you, he couldn't beat them with his bare hands."
519280, "Some are still hiding throughout the town. I'm planning to collect them one by one-I've found one already, and it won't take me too long to find the rest. The children of Suok have no reason to expire in this torture chamber. You can count on me, oynon. I won't let your people die. "
519281, "Do you know where I can find the butchers?"
519282, "Where is this one hiding?"
519283, "You wouldn't turn him in to Fat Vlad, would you? Promise?"
519284, "I promise."
519285, "This butcher's life is mine to command. I shall decide his fate-for my father."
519286, "Then I want his fate to be desided by you, not by Fat Vlad. I am counting on your decency. You are your father's son, aren’t you?"
519287, "I am."
519288, "Ok, I'll tell you. His hideout is the place that anyone with two legs runs away from today. Look for him there. But be careful. He is being hunted. Don't let the hunters catch you two-because they won't waste their time trying to get to know you."
519289, "Do you know what the longmark brands mean?"
519290, "How could I? Women aren't allowed to know that."
519291, "Pity."
519292, "Don't worry."
519293, ""
519294, "Why did you come, child of Boddho?"
519295, "What are you doing here?"
519296, "We were hired by the outsider oynon. He gave us a task, we had to open the dead up for him. He was looking for the disease inside them. There were four of us."
519297, "How did it go?"
519298, "Patrolmen came. Killed two of my brothers. Now they're after the third one. I've hidden here. The body that I opened up was taken away to be buried. I opened it up poorly, brother... I'm ashamed of that. I did manage to cut the small lines and prepare the thin tissues for the oynon though."
519299, "Okay. That's not why I'm looking for you."
519300, "I want to ask you about Longmark."
519301, "I have no knowledge of the circles of Longmark. I'm neither an oynon, nor a menkhu, nor a shaman."
519302, "What do you want?"
519303, "Tell me what this brand means. Look, I've drawn the sign for you."
519304, "Tell me what this brand means."
519305, "You are an oynon of a menkhu kin, are you not? I've seen this brand before. I don't know its lines. I've seen it in a terrible place. There is a corridor in the depths of the Abattoir, the route that Supremes take when they come from the Steppe to be celebrated. Oyun, the Foreman of the Abattoir, can explain the meaning to you."
519306, "Supremes?"
519307, "You don't know who Supremes are? You're joking."
519308, "Tell me."
519309, "You are joking. They cannot be called by name, for they are not to be talked about. What next? Are you going to tell me you don't know of the one that is called Bos Turokh?"
519310, "Are you talking about bulls?"
519311, "Are you talking about gods?"
519312, "Yes. Among other things. Don't play jokes on me, oynon. Don't make fun of me just because I'm a simple man."
519313, "What else can you tell me about this sign?"
519314, "If something is marked with this sign, then it is neither a man, nor a child of Boddho, nor of Suok. It's a Supreme. What you need is not a man, oynon. Your father had something to do with Those Who Walk the Corridor. It scares me. The brand is drawn there for a reason. They are not men. This is all I know."
519315, "Well, thanks anyway."
519316, "Be careful."
519317, "Are you aware that Olgimsky is after you?"
519318, "Boös Vlad? Yes, I know."
519319, "Get away from here as quickly as possible. I promised to lead him to your hideout if I ever find you."
519320, "As you wish. You've made a wise and honest choice."
519321, "Will you help me?"
519322, "All right. In any case, I need your help."
519323, "The local thief kingpin."
519324, "Oh, that lowlife... What does he want of me?"
519325, "He only said that your meeting would be mutually beneficial."
519326, "I'm not going to meet those pickpockets. They'll have to make do with Rubin."
519327, "I want to be completely honest with you, oynon. They will leave the boys be if you promise to come by."
519328, "Are the boys' lives in danger?"
519329, "They are."
519330, "All right. I'll go."
519331, "No, they're just picking on them."
519332, "I think he's simply mocking us."
519333, "The matter will settle itself then."
519334, "As you wish."
519335, "He sells weapons at a bargain price."
519336, "I've got a revolver already. Haven't shot once with it; hopefully I won't ever have to. I've been warned that it's prone to misfiring and will most likely just explode after ten or so shots."
519337, "Then do it for the kids. There are urchins living next to the thieves."
519338, "All right. As you wish."
519339, "I hope I manage to make what I want out of it. Meanwhile, how can I return your kindness? I have no money, but I can offer you something better-the drugs that are not available to the general public yet. I can't give them all right away though, so you'll have to choose what you want: immunogens, antibiotics, or painkillers?"
519340, "Immunogens."
519341, "Antibiotics."
519342, "Painkillers."
519343, "I'd rather have bandage packages."
519344, "A little bird told me."
519345, "Was this little bird Rubin?"
519346, "Rubin doesn't speak to me, oynon. Seems like he still believes that I'm guilty of patricide."
519347, "I can remedy that."
519348, "I would be very grateful. Good luck with the tissue."
519349, "Yes. You're talking about menkhu-they're butchers and wardens. That is their right. But it's not about morals."
519350, "Exactly. I need tissues of a person who died of the Sand Plague. I need them today, right now! I've tried to get them at the cemetery, but failed miserably. The patrolmen are vigilantly watching over the dead."
519351, "I'd reward you generously for that."
519352, "Deal. I'll do what I can, even though I still don't have the right to."
519353, "Why? Aren't you one of the-what do you call them...? Well, your father was a surgeon."
519354, "Nobody knows me here yet. But I've said my word. I'll do the best I can-if I can."
519355, "Please allow me to return the favour. Here are the medical supplies that are not available to the general public yet. I can't give them all to you, so choose what you want the most: immunogens, antibiotics, or painkillers?"
519356, "Immunogens."
519357, "Painkillers."
519358, "Antibiotics."
519360, "I'd rather have some bandage packages."
519361, "I want to ask you something, oynon. Something very important. It's about a panacea."
519362, "What are you talking about? The serum?"
519363, "Yes. Tell me how to extract antibodies from tissue."
519364, "First of all, they have to be there. If you're sure they are, then there are several general ways to go from there. A serum, after all, is just a blood component. As far as I understand, you can mix a sample of it with those... natural agents. We'll need to get a sample first though. Then go ahead. Experiment."
519365, "Right. An experiment like this has been successful once before."
519366, "So I've heard. Your father was a natural. So what did you want to ask of me? "
519367, "When you get down to studying a tissue sample, please see if there are antibodies in it."
519368, "I have no intention to hide my results from you, obviously. But, regrettably, I have serious doubts that they are going to make you happy; it doesn't look like human organisms can resist the disease at all. At least that's what I've been seeing so far, sadly..."
519369, "Yet my father's endeavours were a success."
519370, "That's all I'm hoping for. Don't worry, I'll tell you of my findings. The first results will become available as soon as tomorrow."
519371, "Thank you."
519372, "I know you are a killer. One of the worst killers anyone in this town has ever seen, in fact. You are charged with premediated murder of at least four people. The death of Simon Kain and your father are being looked into."
519373, "You have no proof."
519374, "But I will, damn it! If it weren't for Simon's death... And the sudden threat of an epidemic... If only they let me off the leash! Perhaps tonight I will finally get rid of it though. Your patron, Olgimsky, won't be able to veto my decisions then!"
519375, "I'm starting to like him."
519376, "Is there somewhere I can stay in this town?"
519377, "You've got estate here, I believe. Your late father had a house and a secret laboratory even."
519378, "My father's house is unclean."
519379, "Can't help you with that. It is your house."
519380, "Not any more."
519381, "Go to hell!"
519382, "Who is investigating my father's murder?"
519383, "No one at the moment."
519384, "Why?"
519385, "Because there's no time for that. There are matters of greater importance."
519386, "I'm not really sure what's keeping me from breaking your nose."
519387, "Who will take care of it and when?"
519388, "I will deal with your father's murder personally when I'm not distracted all the time and the order is restored. And something tells me that you won't be too happy with the results. I won't let you off the hook."
519389, "Undoubtedly."
519390, "That's better than nothing."
519391, "It is only out of respect for the Bachelor-he is for some reason absolutely sure of your innocence, that's understandable, he's an outsider after all-but it is only out of respect for him that I will hand you the inheritance. I will be watching every step you make, however. Don't even think about absconding."
519392, "Be my guest."
519393, "You may take possession of your inheritance. The affairs of the deceased were conducted by one Aspity. She lives nearby, her den is in the Crude Sprawl. You'll have to make do without a guide and find the way to her house on your own. And don't you dare leave the town! Your culpability is all but proven. It's almost over."
519394, "We'll see."
519395, "Watch your tongue!"
519396, "A shame I'm bound by my word! Or you'd be dealt with right here!"
519397, "I've come to take possession of my father's inheritance."
519398, "What I 'will do'? That's interesting."
519399, "Don't play innocent, Burakh. You were born here. You were raised here. Sometimes it even seems to me that I remember you. You must have seen the 'long strife' of the two Mistresses, Victoria and Nina. You know how Mistresses can see the future!"
519400, "So what do the late Mistresses say I will do?"
519401, "A living Mistress does. Katerina Saburova, my wife. She knows you will bring us much sorrow in the coming days. You'd be in jail already if not for Olgimsky's protection!"
519402, "Since when are a clairvoyant's words grounds for imprisonment?"
519403, "I'd put you in jail at my own risk, willingly. This isn't the Capital, your civil rights mean nothing here. Here, the scope of your rights is determined by the will of the rulers."
519404, "Got that already."
519405, "I never intended to."
519406, "I'll have to make use of what little time I have left then."
519407, "You kill a single living soul, and you're a dead man! Dead on the spot! You hear me? I will even distribute weapons to the townsfolk so that they can shoot you! I'll make you an outlaw so that anyone can put you down like a rabid dog!"
519408, "I see a rabid dog right before me."
519409, "I'll make you regret this conversation yet."
519410, "Why are you so self-assured, architect?"
519411, "Because I have the will to kill. It is easy for me to take the life of a living being. Living beings can feel that, and fear paralyzes them before I even strike."
519412, "Will is not enough. You have to have skill as well."
519413, "Where there's a will, there's a way. And I know how ways are supposed to work, be it archways or ways of taking lives. I've got a knack for it, it's an artist thing."
519414, "Is that so? It's hard to find a way in the Steppe."
519415, "It depends. And if I can't find a way, I can always make one. Perhaps they won't die, but they'll serve me just fine."
519416, "Why are you telling me all this?"
519417, "I'm telling you this, Steppe man, so that you know what to expect from me. Perhaps one day you'll need it."
519418, "My name is Artemy Burakh."
519419, "How do you know?"
519420, "I can see it in your eyes. How much?"
519421, "It isn't only twyre. Swevery, for one, is rare this season."
519422, "Well, let's trade."
519423, "I'll remember that."
519424, "So I've been told."
519425, "No use trying that on me."
519426, "One day you may encounter someone who knows their ways better than you."
519427, "You don't know anything about the Steppe."
519428, "We'll see."
519429, "Are a twyre buyer?"
519430, "No. But I'm its fervent admirer. And constant consumer, too."
519431, "Do you drink twyrine?"
519432, "I do."
519433, "How long have you been drinking it?"
519434, "What, are a you a doctor too? Have you all conspired to ask me the same questions? Or am I having a deja vu? Eh, no, I get it. All of you are the same person, right?"
519435, "'All of us' who?"
519436, "The touchy-feely girl and the guest-star scientist. All that's missing is my pulse measured and a kiss on the forehead. Yes, I am healthy, thank you very much."
519437, "Don't worry. I'm not going to kiss you on the forehead."
519438, "That much is obvious."
519439, "Does it help?"
519440, "It helps with inspiration, wish I could say the same about the heart rate. It is also a great way to deprive yourself of memory, which is often a very useful quality."
519441, "Actually, temporary amnesia comes with bad brain vessels."
519444, "Why is it that you hate me so much?"
519445, "You smell of blood."
519446, "Oh! You've got a keen nose."
519447, "I've got a keen heart."
519448, "I'm coming to see the Bachelor."
519449, "You'll have to bear with the smell of blood for as long as I have business to discuss with your tenant."
519450, "Blood smells like smoke. It smells of memory, knowledge, and ancient religion."
519451, "Heart? My favorite part."
519452, "Stop it... I want you to stop coming to my house!"
519453, "And empty eyes."
519454, "What are you burning in here? Is it harl or something?"
519455, "Heh! We're arming ourselves. Testing the improvised grenades. Smoke grens, they need care too. And we're also burning the fur."
519456, "Fur? What fur?"
519457, "Our animals' fur. We're combing them! But we've known each of them since the first day of their lives. It's nothing to worry about."
519458, "Sounds quite suspicious, what with the news about the outbreak."
519459, "And what kind of animals are they?"
519460, "Dogs. Cats. Rats. A wolf cub. Crows. Owls. Grass-snakes."
519461, "Bet the grass-snakes shed the most fur..."
519462, "I see."
519463, "What have I done to earn your respect?"
519464, "Your father was respected by us lot, so you will be too. If we get a connection, that is."
519465, "Did you know my father closely?"
519466, "Heh... He never went refusin' us lot help, and that was 'nough for me. Thou shalt respect kindness more than anything else."
519467, "So you had business with him?"
519468, "No way... I couldn't even get near him. He was a wise, well-respected man, your father was. Us children of dirt had no business rubbin' shoulders with a guy like this... It just feels good to have a spiritual beacon walk among us people-keepin' both himself and us in austerity."
519469, "Who could have killed him?"
519470, "Nobody's got nothin' to gain from that, I think. There was a tale goin' about though... that your honourable father was plannin' to finally take the proper place-the one that belonged to the guy by the rite and the right... of birth, that is."
519471, "What place?"
519472, "The place that ain't pointed at by no charters. But every single whelp in the Kin can see that invisible throne. Foreman Oyun sits it now, all comfy there like a slug on a fruit. Sittin' tight all right, but it looks mighty ugly..."
519473, "I see."
519474, "Planning? What do you mean?"
519475, "I mean what I say, mate. He has stated his willingness to do just that. Aye, you think nothin' of it. 'Twas not about ambition, 'twas only unavoidable fate. He must've foreseen hard trials comin'. And here they are! The Kin is all locked up, and the Sand Dirt's leakin' from every crevice."
519476, "Is that so..."
519477, "Well, keep yourself in good health, will you!"
519478, "Same to you."
519479, "We'll see."
519480, "That is true."
519481, "Those were unexpected words from you."
519482, "Do you?"
519483, "I have already heard that Saburov hates you. Katerina has scared him witless with her prophecies. It seems that he believes you to be more terrible a creature than shabnak-adyr herself. If he gets absolute authority, we will have to hide you. He will demand we turn you in."
519484, "How can he get absolute authority?"
519485, "Isn't his authority absolute already?"
519486, "Of course not. The town is governed by three families, just like before. The Saburov's position has grown stronger since mom died, however, since Katerina is the only Mistress left. Oh, I wonder how much longer I have to wait..."
519487, "What does Saburov want?"
519488, "Katerina is a weak Mistress. She can see the future, but I doubt she can change anything. Nor can she grant others strength like mom did... Saburov wants to make up for her weakness with his power. He wants to rule alone and with an iron fist."
519489, "How can he do that?"
519490, "He will do so on the pretext of curbing the epidemic. Have you heard what the Bachelor has announced?"
519491, "When is this likely to happen?"
519492, "It depends... If the Bachelor's suspicions are correct, it could even happen tomorrow. Hopefully it never does."
519493, "Hopefully."
519514, "A Bride. A true Bride now. I was but a girl yesterday. Now I dance with the Earth, sing to the herbs, and lure swevery out in the open with my very whisper."
519515, "Do you gather herbs?"
519516, "No. Gatherers gather herbs. I merely live. I caress the Earth, I kiss the Earth, I nourish it with my warmth. Every night I run through the herbs naked and sing lullabies to them. Every night demands a different lullaby. Every herb demands a different lullaby. I know them all. I know how to make herbs lush."
519517, "So you summon herbs from below the ground?"
519518, "Not all of them. Some of them."
519519, "Your husband is a lucky man."
519520, "He will be rich, but for that-he is never to touch me. That makes him miserable. Can you see how much I love him? Could it be that this generous summer has been conceived by my love? Herbs are everywhere; the world is a-herb; the odour makes my head spin! Herbs lull the world to sleep; my chosen one is sleeping. But I do not miss him."
519521, "Why?"
519522, "My father sold me to another man, he sold me to his odongh, the one that has made camp on the other side of the river. He could have become rich; I could have become well-respected. Perhaps there will be less herbs now. Perhaps none at all."
519523, "That's too bad."
519566, "You may come into your inheritance. No one will dare get in your way. There's no proof of your wrongdoing... You may take the keys from Alexander Saburov. I can't imagine how they got into his hands... but never mind. That's the good news."
519567, "Who is this Alexander?"
519568, "Pray see... I'm not the only one to bear the burden of authority in this town. The power is divided among three families: the Olgimskys, the Kains, and the Saburovs. The Saburovs are mostly in charge of... shall I say... the executive power. The enforcement machine, so to speak."
519569, "And the bad news?"
519570, "The bad news. I've spoken to Saburov about your... case. And he is, to say the least, furious. It seems that he's set on destroying you by any means possible-disregarding my protection and my personal warranty of good faith."
519571, "What have I done to make him so angry?"
519572, "It's not him, I think, but rather his wife. Katerina is a Mistress, a woman of a mystical gift... Her opinion is well-respected... no matter what kind of person she is. And she has had a vision of you bringing some horrific bloodshed to pass. That is the price of your ascension to glory, according to her."
519574, "Is that so? I had no plans for mass bloodshed."
519575, "Everyone has their ups and downs."
519576, "I believe you, I do... But can it really be helped? Alexander trusts his wife more than he'd ever trust me. The Saburovs' duty is to maintain order, and such a discovery about your... mission couldn't make them happy. It seems that Alexander has taken it upon himself to stop you from fulfilling this... ahem... prophecy."
519577, "Is your name enough to hold him back?"
519578, "Yes-for a while... But the news of Simon Kain's death, the rumours of some epidemic... they're stirring our small town. The people are scared. Alexander is demanding emergency powers. And if he gets what he's asking for, I won't be able to help you like I do now. The Lump will not protect you then."
519579, "So what do we do?"
519580, "We hope for the best. I have arranged for a hideout to be prepared-just in case... You will be able to lay low and continue your work there even if Saburov does get the power... and orders me to turn you in. The place isn't exactly comfortable, but it's reliable. It will become your home."
519581, "Thank you, boös Vlad."
519582, "Not at all... I've done so little for you... The times we live in-the mad and cruel times! But you will come into your father's inheritance. Talk to Alexander... and his wife even. Use the short break and the immunity that you have while you have them..."
519583, "I'll come by later."
519584, "What of the bad news?"
519586, "I will."
519587, "Are you trying to drive me away from here then?"
519588, "Are you human?"
519589, "Raawrrr! No hummin am I! Ha ha ha! What, does it look like I've really got a dog's head?"
519590, "It does look like it from far away... Come to think of it, it's eerily realistic at close range, too. Makes me shudder a bit."
519591, "Yes! Yes! That's right! We're not called Dogheads for nothin'! Ya see, ya hobo man? No way ya can tell if it's real or not!"
519592, "I came here for you, little doggy."
519593, "Oh really! You're in cahoots with them then too? No way... So, who sent ya?"
519594, "Someone who's very unhappy with you. They want your blood."
519595, "Are they nuts? Why are they bullyin' me? So I did some snoopin' here and there, so what... So I did do some double agentin'... Ugh, I'm done! Don't wanna rat out the Soul-and-a-Halves to the thieves, don't wanna rat out the thieves to the Soul-and-a-Halves! I'm the only sensible person around here!"
519596, "Jokes aside, kid, I've got bad news."
519597, "There is a reliable method. I can simply take that head off you along with your neck and check it out."
519598, "They say spirits used to grant heads like these to traitors in ancient times."
519599, "Why do they want you dead? This is your last chance. I don't like traitors."
519600, "Because you're going to run out of people to rat out, eh?"
519602, "Have mercy on me, good man. He who saves a life will be rewarded! I just can't tell ya what they want me dead for... It would make me feel real bad. But I won't do it anymore."
519603, "Oh no, I'm done with that for reals. Done! So what do ya want?"
519604, "I've come to kill you."
519605, "Shove off! You make me sick..."
519614, "Who is this?"
519615, "Don't finish him off, please! This is the man that tried to kill you. One of those who assaulted you at the Station. He says it was you who crippled him. He will die soon enough anyway, he's got so little blood left... Will you let him be?"
519616, "How can you possibly transfuse blood to him?"
519617, "Don't worry about this. There are a lot of people here who know how to handle blood. Fewer of those willing to share it..."
519618, "Okay. I'll speak to that usurer of yours."
519619, "I'll think about it."
519620, "Ahhh! Why?!"
519621, "Bury him."
519622, "That is my rule: finish off what has been started."
519623, "It would be best for you to leave. Now..."
519624, "The Olgimskys are careful about their safety. I still have many enemies. Vlad the Younger will show me a safe place where I can live and work."
519625, "They keys to my property are held by a man who is in charge of law enforcement and whose duty commands him to get rid of me. Oh well..."
519626, "This is the home of Mistress Katerina. She had a true vision about me recently. I still remember the previous Mistresses... Katerina was barely twenty then..."
519627, "So this place is in no way a 'hospice.' It's a haven for fugitive workmen. Its mistress is harbouring butchers and Worms that have fallen out of boös Vlad's favour."
519628, "Fine. If I find out the butcher's whereabouts, I'll tell you. But I won't vouch for what happens next."
519629, "That will do for me! Dare I say... I will take action immediately."
519630, "So who can help me find him?"
519631, "There is a shack... I've tried sending people over there already, they were greeted coldly. A certain lady lives in it... She is always in the loop; she knows the butchers' ways and what they're after. They say she was begotten by an odongh and a twyre bride... Start off there. She will treat you with respect."
519632, "Show me where it is."
519633, "'The Brand'"
519634, "If I am to figure out the mystery of my inheritance, I will have to pay a visit to Aspity-this time disguised as a traitor. However, she seems to be wiser than the rest and doesn't necessarily disapprove of me. Perhaps I should put my trust in her."
519635, "According to Aspity, one of the fugitive butchers could be hiding in this house."
519636, "Aspity gave up the life of the butcher, albeit reluctantly... So my birthright puts me in charge of the children of Boddho-as long as whatever I do is meant to serve the common good? I need to find the fugitive to be sure."
519638, "Where can I find this Foreman?"
519639, "He often sees the Master, boös Vlad. Ask the Master. Or enter the Abattoir, if you're brave."
519640, "What else can you tell me about this sign?"
519641, "Boös Vlad has the Kin firmly in his heavy hand. He'll tell me how to deal with that Foreman. It can't be difficult for him to arrange that."
519642, "I'm starting to get the picture. Only one of the menkhu, someone who knows the lines, may become the Foreman of the Abattoir and make sure that the killing is performed in strict accordance with the ritual. He is the ultimate sacred authority. He rules the Kin. The only thing left is to find out who holds this position these days. Vlad the Heavy will tell me the name. He will know everything about the Bull Project."
519643, "The Kin will welcome your kindly, oynon."
519644, "Hurry up! Big Vlad's men will be here soon."
519645, "Hopefully."
519646, "It's a shame that I have to leave this hideout. There are patrols outside."
519647, "Only a few."
519648, "Thank you, oynon."
519649, "You're welcome."
519650, "*** What kind of creature hides beneath the brand? Is it someone who has no name whatsoever and is thus defined by a symbol? Or is it terrifying to such an extent that it is forbidden to speak its name? Is this knowledge sacred? Whatever the reason, it is clear that special measures were taken to keep the identity a secret. I will have to postpone the meeting with the Foreman. The mystery of the Sought One is yet to be deciphered. The panacea still has to be made, so I have to keep working."

519652, "Capella senses that Notkin is in trouble. He's probably still here. I think he had a sprained ankle..."
519653, "Looks like Grief will try to turn any mixup into a chance to profit. He's asking to send the Bachelor to him. As if my words have any weight to that capitol dandy..."
519654, "I've rescued the kid. Victoria's senses didn't fool her. I wonder how often she senses such things. Better tell her about it, anyhow."
519655, "'Capella's Troubles'"
519656, "Vlad the Heavy's daughter takes good care of her friends. Although, strange perhaps that she calls her friends 'the Bound'. Her intuition suggests that Notkin, the leader of the homeless children, is in some kind of trouble. Something worth checking out."
519657, "Bad Grief agreed to let the urchins be, on the condition that I bring Bachelor Dankovsky to him. I wonder if he will be able to get over his arrogance for the sake of a few homeless children."
519658, "Bachelor Dankovsky promised that the meeting will happen. He gives every appearance of a man who will keep his word. I can return to Bad Grief now."
519659, "These cutthroats are mistreating the children! I had no choice but to kill the scoundrels. Perhaps I should check on the boys to see if everything is all right."
519660, "For the time being, Notkin won't have to worry about the safety of his shed. I think I'm deserving of young Capella's gratitude for this."
519661, "*** Capella was glad to hear the news, but her joy was a bit... awkward. It's as if she made the decision to take care of him out of duty, and not out of true friendship. Makes me wonder, what kind of games do these children play?"
519662, "Grief says he's called off the cordon. That'll put the boys at ease."
519663, "Bad Grief will call off his thugs. I can check on Notkin's den to see if everything is all right inside."
519664, "I've got bad news, Grief."
519665, "Everybody does. There ain't been nobody bringin' good news since mornin'."
519666, "I couldn't find a way to get on well with your rogues out there. So I had to kill them."
519667, "Did they pick on you?"
519668, "Yes."
519669, "So you're no guy to be picked on. 'Twas their own thick heads' fault that they rolled."
519670, "I'm glad we've come to an understanding."
519671, "Eh, well, it's nothing really."
519672, "Have you sent out your scouts yet?"
519673, "Have you brought us ten infusions yet? I must've missed them!"
519674, "Don't you try being smart with me."
519675, "I will soon."
519676, "I'm not in the habit of sending my friends to their deaths. A direct attack is different. But you can't punch a disease."
519678, "Be patient. You'll have them soon."
519679, "'...By the Burakh Family Recipe'"
519680, "It appears that Notkin plans to set up some dangerous reconnaisance operation. He says he will share some valuable information in exchange for ten immune system stimulants. Burakh's knowledge of medicine is still held in the highest regard. I will have to gather enough herbs and distill some brews that might help to immunise the body."
519681, "*** Apparently, the disease is spreading in sporadic enclosures, hardly ever crossing the border of an infected district... Notkin's stray children are planning to investigate these hazardous places. Starting tomorrow, they are going to draw a map of whichever districts are attacked by the sickness each day. This will be useful."
519682, "Here I can make infusions and potions from rare herbs using a crude makeshift still."
519683, "Incidentally, I have learned of the difficulties you face in figuring out the mysterious subject denoted by the ancient sign. Did Isidor's inheritance make reference to it? I think we have a lot to discuss. Do pay me a visit./n/nAlways at your service,/nOlgimsky"
519684, "A New Invitation from Vlad Olgimsky the Older"
519685, "Let's see..."
519686, "Well?"
519687, "You're right, it's curious... There are indeed no antibodies here. But the bacteria are weak... emaciated, half-dead! Most importantly, this doesn't even look like human blood at all... As far as I can tell... Oh yes, I would very much like to have a serious talk with Rubin. Please find a way to persuade Lara to disclose his whereabouts."
519688, "I'll try."
519689, "Pffft, you don't have to. No one's making you. I'm off though. Bye!"
519690, "I'll catch up with you if I change my mind."
519691, "I did it for myself, not for you."
519692, "The words of an honest man! How can I repay you? Like, do you need anything of mine?"
519693, "Tell me who sent you."
519694, "Eh... It sort of... Happened all by itself... Someone said that one of the rulers promised a reward for the killer... Dunno who it was, Kain or Fat Vlad maybe... So they sent us to keep watch. 'He's gonna wait for the train,' they said, 'And when it comes-bam!-and he's out. Watch his smoke then...'"
519695, "So which one was it? Kain? Or Vlad?"
519696, "I dunno, I really don't... I think... I think it was Vlad. It's not like I was assigned. I'm not a leader by nature, y'know? I just followed my mates' cue. We were told that the bony maneater had to be caught. We even did the garlic thing. And there you go... Here's how it turned out..."
519697, "Why beat up someone who was getting off the train then?"
519698, "It was stupid of us... didn't work out all that well... Sorry, mate."
519700, "You silly people."
519701, "You had it coming."
519702, "Yeah. It didn't work out at all."
519703, "...Is not the killer?"
519704, "Yes."
519705, "Yes. I'm not the killer, I'm... their victim. Got it?"
519707, "That ain't hard at all! We'll spread the word all together. The truth'll be restored in no time!"
519708, "That's all I'm asking."
519709, "Have some rest."
519710, "Did the blood help?"
519711, "Yeah... I can't remember how you poured it in. The heart's beating all right."
519712, "All right then. It seems like I'm following in my father's footsteps."
519713, "What was what about?"
519714, "He was wearing a dog's head."
519715, "So he's gradually turning into a little bitch... That's the punishment for those who steal from their friends."
519716, "This can't be true."
519717, "Hey, do you think only people walk on two legs? Life is more complicated than that. Sometimes you think, 'This can't be'-and the next thing you know, it's staring you right in the face... All right, just kidding. It was just a mask. So what did you do to him?"
519718, "Things escalated... I had to kill him. He was a damn good fighter."
519719, "A coward."
519720, "Exactly! So what did you do to him?"
519721, "I let him go."
519722, "Pah... What kind of a Ripper does that?"
519723, "Where did you get the idea that I'm the Ripper?"
519724, "Well... Never mind then. Perhaps you did the right thing. I feel better now. I was so angry I couldn't breathe! You were right not to kill him. Did you at least give him a good thrashing though?"
519726, "Don't be sorry. He'll get what's coming to him."
519727, "I did."
519728, "I killed him."
519729, "Well, that deserves a celebration! The hand of fate has found the traitor, scoundrel, and thief! Please allow me to thank you with this prize weapon."
519730, "You told me not to hurt dogs. He partially fit the description."
519731, "A war?"
519732, "A war with the Dogheads. That stinking bastard, that heartless, soulless little rat! Stole the most precious thing we owned, murdered a friend... and ran over to the enemy's side! We used to think he was one of us! Was he pretending all along? He deserves to die, to be killed..."
519733, "Are you at war?"
519734, "What precious thing?"
519735, "They're a gang like us... The Dogheads. The difference is there are fifty of us against five hundred of them. They want to eliminate us. We're resisting. This is our war. There's been no deaths so far, but the whole thing is serious. Playtime's over."
519736, "So your guy switched sides, right?"
519737, "A very important medicine. A shmowder. They're very rare since they're handmade. The recipe is unknown. There are different ones; some will cure you, others will kill you. We had the last one to use as a sample, to learn to tell which ones help by their taste. They all look the same."
519738, "What does it cure?"
519739, "There used to be a horrible disease here. Came from nowhere, disappeared later. It gives me the creeps when I remember it. It was horrible, spreading like wildfire... It's a miracle we stopped it. Well... we kept the shmowder afterwards because we remembered what it was like. And he stole it! Leaving us to die... The stinking prick!"
519740, "So where's this guy now?"
519741, "Aspity keeps track of every fugitive. Maybe some of them have a death wish? Better ask her..."
519742, "A den for the workmen. Used to be called Golghoy Khen but now has a Latin name. You can always find shaman dancing girls in here."
519743, "'The Quivering Heart'"
519744, "The Bachelor has concluded that the only way to isolate the Sand Pest is to obtain a still beating human heart. There is something in the blood of the steppe people that does not allow the infection to spread. Could it be that a panacea could be made from it? Would Aspity offer one of her butchers for this purpose? Or would Andrey agree to sacrifice one of his dancers?"
519745, "The runaway butchers have left the town. For some reason they were on their way to visit the herb bride, who lives with one of the twyre-gathering Worms. I can still get ahold of them there."
519746, "*** The quivering heart is in my hands. The Sand Pest is inside, along with a few spontaneous particles that have appeared as a result of humanity's hopeless struggle with the sickness. Being called 'The Ripper' is a fair price for the chance to hold something like this."
519747, "This is the Blind Backyard, where Willow's going to meet that stranger from the Capital. He's fast on his feet, that Bachelor..."
519748, "Why aren't you leaving?"
519749, "I've changed my mind. Turn your back at me!"
519750, "It's nothing... Just looking at you for the last time."
519751, ""
519752, "Artemy Burakh... Yes, Isidor's death is a terrible loss... terrible. Just like your looks... but please forgive this old man his poor manners. It's hard for me to tell you that the death of your beloved father is most likely just the beginning of your misfortunes... master Burakh."
519753, "Some bastards attacked me as soon as I got off the train."
519754, "Yes, I've heard... already. Those bastards, however, weren't looking for the person who got off the train, but rather for someone planning to board it. They were after a murderer, you see... the one who's caused a lot of problems already... a lot. They say your father's death is the murderer's doing too. Eh?"
519755, "I don't understand."
519756, "The men at the station mistook you for the murderer. Problem is, now they're broadcasting your features to anyone who would listen. You do stand out, you know... And mass hysteria is an excellent environment for rash accusations... Coupled with the questionable visions of a certain influential lady..."
519757, "So I'm a suspect?"
519758, "A suspect? No... I wish... It's not a suspicion, there's not a shade of doubt. They're positive it was you, my dear master Burakh. You are being hunted... and until panic settles down... please do consider their proof irrefutable. Those who have been left lying by the station are self-explanatory too..."
519759, "What am I being accused of?"
519760, "First of all, the deaths that you are actually to blame for. It was self-defence, perhaps, but you can't prove that right now... but that's a minor problem anyway. Secondly, the murder of this town's leader, Simon Kain. Now that is more serious... A tangled mess of interests and parties... And thirdly, you've been accused of killing your father, Isidor."
519761, "That's enough."
519762, "The leader's death has stirred the townsfolk up, and the Kains are also willing to take drastic measures now... And you don't want to make those hawks angry... Patricide is a blasphemous crime, and you're yet to clear those accusations up. As for now, you're an outlaw..."
519763, "Hopefully you believe I'm innocent."
519764, "I do, and so do the members of my family... perhaps several others... We do believe you are innocent, yes. But going out there... pray forgive me... it would be better to march straight to the wheel to be broken on... The mob will tear you into pieces. Do you have a weapon?"
519765, "I can defend myself."
519766, "Those poor creatures in the streets are really not to blame... Don't be too harsh on them. For the first time in many years they've got an opportunity to witness... absolute evil. They will come to their senses... in due time. Meanwhile you need to come into your inheritance, don't you? And that means you need to free yourself from accusations first. Eh?"
519767, "Yes."
519768, "My word won't be enough. Everyone's squabbling... they'll probably see foul play in this... Here's what I think. The Kains have commissioned a peculiar man to handle Simon's case. A bachelor of medicine. He'd come a long way here, and just in time, too... As though it was meant to be like this... He's the one searching for the murderer for them."
519769, "So you suggest I meet him?"
519770, "He's quite quick on the draw, they say... If only you could find him before he finds you... he won't shoot you straight away then, perhaps. Meanwhile, I'll be doing everything I can to aid you. It would have been so much better if you could just... lay low for a while... But they'll come for you here soon, I'm afraid."
519772, "I'll take any well-minded advice."
519773, "How can I remedy the situation?"
519774, "You have to restore your good name. The townsfolk are simple-minded here; hard-fisted, but kind-hearted. Popular choices and deeds can erase and rewrite your past... more than once. No one will remember what you'd done before that. Just please refrain from killing! We have a tight community here, everything happens... in the public eye."
519775, "I believe in self-defence."
519776, "Somehow I don't feel like striving for popularity."
519777, "Patricide? Killing my father?! This is horseshit!"
519778, "It's all one big mess, one big knot, you have to see that. It's not like the mob is looking for two separate murderers, really... the patterns feel similar... the circumstances... and by the way, Isidor and Simon had met the day before. What can I say? One thing leads to another... it's not like they've got the time to reflect upon the situation thoughtfully... he-heh... they're in a hurry to catch the bad guy! While the bad guy's still here..."
519779, "But I've only just arrived-on a switch engine."
519780, "Pray tell, and who was the engine driver, huh? Don't rack your brains, you won't remember... but I will. The station, after all, is my domain... He won't testify to your alibi, a half-human that he is... deaf and dumb too. And nobody knows how long you had been hiding in the town, having secretly arrived. The seer had spoken of it beforehand..."
519781, "I wouldn't wish all this on my worst enemy..."
519782, "They were asking for it."
519783, "What lady?"
519784, "A well-respected one. Do you remember the Saburovs? I doubt that... Katerina isn't that much older than you. Katerina, Alexander Saburov's wife. She has extraordinary talents... Precognitive, dare I say... No one questions them... That much is certain."
519785, "Did she foresee me coming?"
519786, "Not only that... She foresaw many horrors related to you. But it's all very vague. And, you know, compared to my deceased wife, Katerina's talents are... to put it mildly... controversial. But they're enough for the commoners to identify you and..."
519787, "So what, am I a suspect for the whole town?"
519788, "What? My father has been murdered?"
519789, "There is a theory... A weird death... he was ready for it though, wasn't he? He did let you know beforehand... And then he died precisely that night... Well, the fear's greater than the reason for it, you know. Pray tell... Why would anyone examine the evidence now? It's so much easier to just tear apart the troublemaker... you, that is."
519790, "What do I have to do with the murder? I've only just arrived."
519791, "This misfortune is already more than enough."
519792, "We'll fight for the justice then, shall we... master Burakh."
519793, "Do the members of your family also believe I'm innocent?"
519794, "Pray forgive me... As firmly as they believe they're innocent themselves."
519795, "Can I speak to them?"
519796, "Of course... My daughter lives with me, she is in the next wing. My son, Vladislav Jr., is currently staying in a building on the outskirts of the town... he's got some shady business there... I'll give you the address. Perhaps they'll help you in word and deed."
519797, "I hope so."
519798, "What do you think I should do now?"
519802, "Still, I'd rather hide here for the time being."
519803, "Pray forgive me... But this is a poor choice. You're always welcome at the Lump, of course... but that will not work out in your favour... And if they come here to arrest you, you'll have nothing to prove your innocence... and I will have to comply. The choice, however, is yours."
519804, "All right, I'll follow your advice."
519805, "And yet I'll rest here for a while."
519806, "I'll go and talk to your daughter."
519807, "I'm bleeding. Do you have a first-aid kit?"
519808, "Ask the servants... those that haven't scattered, that is... the panic... the panic is so devastating... Better yet, go ask my daughter, little Victoria, she's in the other wing of the house. She'll help you..."
519809, "Thank you."
519810, "I'm counting on you."
519811, ""
519812, "Speak with my father first! He lives next door."
519813, "I wanted to speak with you first."
519814, "Dad said I should send you to him if you get the wrong door and come to me first by mistake. I have to behave."
519815, "Ok."
519816, "All in due time."
519817, "Being slandered is terrible and sad. There is only one way out: doing good and not doing bad anymore."
519818, "How do I do that?"
519819, "You know what my mom used to tell me? There's good fortune and bad fortune. When someone is touched by the bad fortune, it jumps on his neck and rides him wherever it pleases, further and further-until he shrugs it off. The further it pushes him, the longer it takes to get back on track."
519820, "That is nothing new."
519821, "Perhaps. But the point is the bad fortune will plant misdeeds on your path so that you commit more and more of them. Even something innocent thrown into your path by the bad fortune can turn into a truly evil deed when you're carrying it on your shoulders!"
519822, "So is it on my shoulders already?"
519823, "It is! It is unlikely you will manage to do a lot good deeds, but please at least try to stay away from doing bad. I can even tell you where the bad deeds await you today... Do you believe in my precognition?"
519824, "I do. Please tell me."
519825, "Danger awaits you at the Cemetery, at the Warehouses, and in the Steppe. I don't know what it is, but chances are you will do a lot of evil there. It would be best for you not to go there today at all... And do not listen to the misguided advice that claims otherwise!"
519826, "I'll think about it."
519827, "Many good people have turned away from you, and the bad ones are drawing closer. Lost in the vaccum, you will be tempted to meet their requests. Do not make that mistake!"
519828, "I'll try."
519829, "No, I'd rather not know."
519830, "Who can I talk to regardless of my reputation?"
519831, "Please heed my words! Khan won't be of any help; however, Sticky is probably hanging around the backstreets, and I haven't heard from Taya for quite a while... Have you by any chance met Grace already, the sweet girl?"
519832, "No."
519833, "She is the gravedigger's daughter. She lives in a small lodge at the cemetery. Do you know where the Cemetery is? It is in Earth, to the southwest of the Abattoir."
519834, "So she believes it wasn't me who killed my father and Simon?"
519835, "She is a wonderful, enthralling, unearthly creature! She may seem strange, but I have never met a kinder, more honest, generous, and beautiful soul than her! And don't you ever believe anyone saying that she loves the dead more than the living. She is just so lonely..."
519836, "I see."
519837, "Do you know a boy called Notkin?"
519838, "No."
519839, "He is so very brave, and a faithful friend, too! He won't ever care for gossip and slander if he comes to love and respect you. Notkin would always come to your aid and be willing to die by your side even if the whole world was against you. He would never betray a friend!"
519840, "I would love to be spoken about like this too."
519841, "Well, he has his ups and downs as well... He is kind to his friends, but he knows no mercy for his foes. And he is overdoing it sometimes. He does have a thirst for blood, just like... well. He'll probably grow up to be a combat general, like Block or Shoin."
519842, "'Just like...' me, right? I can see where you're coming from."
519843, "We'll just wait and see."
519844, "I'll get to know him."
519845, "I do."
519846, "I have."
519847, "What about a boy called Notkin then?"
519848, "I haven't."
519849, "I've met him too."
519850, "True."
519851, "You are a victim of a terrible mistake. Yet there is something I want to reveal to you; it will help you reestablish your good reputation. I'll give you a few names. All of them belong to children, but don't judge them by their age. Some of them may be of invaluable help to you."
519853, "Do you know why their relationship with your father has grown tighter recently?"
519854, "I have no idea."
519855, "The reason is quite sad. These children, my friends and faithful aids, are going to die soon."
519856, "Why? Are they terminally ill?"
519857, "No, but you must believe me. Your father has done so without hesitation-and you know that he was a clever and suspicious man. He kept checking if anything was wrong with the kids every day. That is just how their line of fortune goes. They are more likely to die than to live."
519858, "How do you know that?"
519859, "Precognition. Not only mine though. All of us agree on this. So does... did your father... and Simon... it's still so hard for me to speak about them in the past tense... and Maria too. Katerina even. Everyone agrees. Please take care of them like your father did. They must live! Simon and Isidor died, so they too must be on the brink!"
519860, "What can I do for them?"
519861, "Just keep them in mind. And if you ever hold their lines of fortune in your hand, please do not let them go. You are also not a common man, you know. You are your father's son."
519862, "Is that so..."
519863, "I'll try, but no promises."
519864, "That will not do. They are your responsibility now."
519865, "Seems like it's no use arguing with you."
519866, "Why do you care?"
519867, "I just do. That is how it is supposed to be. I have told you that I feel the coming of a new time. And it will very likely require sacrifice. I don't want to see my friends die."
519868, "Okay. They will live."
519869, "Fortune can't be changed."
519870, "Okay. I'll take care of them."
519871, "Medical matters, I believe. What else could it be?"
519875, ""
519876, "So Isidor has left you an inheritance. A questionable stroke of luck. He wasn't rich, I believe?"
519877, "I'll find a use for the money, no matter the amount."
519878, "I didn't mean the money. Knowing your esteemed father, I dare suggest that there's something else in his inheritance. It is a Burakh's legacy, after all. The family's ritualistic tradition implies mostly something of a less... material nature, doesn't it?"
519879, "Probably."
519880, "Speaking of tradition. I've always marvelled at your Burakhs' faithfulness to your duty. It seems to be sacred for all of you. Especially when it has to do with... debts. Oynon-a wise man-would never allow his dead to have outstanding debts."
519881, "Where are you going with this?"
519882, "A simple analysis leads me to believe that you'll inherit something else-along with priceless knowledge, unique potions, and material possessions, of course. An obligation. A terrible one."
519883, "What? How do you know?"
519884, "A risky obligation. A dangerous one... So, if I were you, I would think twice before accepting that inheritance-even though you're in a dire situation. You may find there's a venomous snake in that precious chest."
519885, "No. I don't believe in avoiding obligations. And I won't ever leave my father beyond life's doorstep burdened with something I'm afraid to take on."
519886, "So I thought... You are truly your father's son. And still... this weight could break your back."
519887, "Do you know something that I don't, master Vlad?"
519888, "Only that this burden broke your father's back the day before. I don't believe in this maneater woman. I simply don't. And I've heard that he'd given an oath. An oath he swore on the honour of his family-and that means on your honour as well. That was why he had called upon you... not because he was about to die."
519889, "Do you know that for sure?"
519890, "No. These are simply my fragmentary observations-I am quite observant, you know-and the following analysis that allows to wrap it all up into a single logical picture. This is my version of what had happened. I commend your principles and courage, but I also feel sorry for you. Think about it."
519891, "I thank you, but I have made up my mind already."
519892, "I'll think about it."
519893, "Do you mean it? In all sincerity?"
519894, "Of course I do. I am the heir to the richest family in the area. I have little to nothing to gain in this matter. It's just sympathy. You came here expecting wealth, but you'll only get... troubles instead."
519895, "Do you know something that I don't, master Vlad?"
519896, "What kind of obligation?"
519897, "True. If that ever happens, this warden's kin is stripped of their right to possess secret knowledge. A haruspex whose conscience is guilty is no longer a haruspex. That's what I've been told."
519898, "Exactly. You're not an expert on the local traditions though, are you? Even though you come from a native family? You were taken away when you were very young."
519899, "You seem to know more than I do. How come?"
519900, "I'm just keen on the local lore."
519901, "I mean my father's personal circumstances. How do you know what his inheritance contains?"
519902, "How do you know that?"
519903, "It's a very small town. Get used to it-except for those secrets that can cost someone their life, none remain secret for long. Something always seeps through. However, the traditions of the Steppe are kept under lock and key more firmly than others."
519904, "Good to hear."
519905, "Downright poor, I'd say. But it has nothing to do with my luck."
519906, "You can always count on me, Burakh."
519907, "Where can I find the tools and resources I need?"
519908, "So you're not welcome in shops, are you? There is a way out. Try to get to know Bad Grief. Tell him your name, and I'd be damned if he doesn't treat you with utmost respect!"
519909, "Who is Bad Grief?"
519910, "The king of thieves, a smuggler, a counterfeit twyrine maker. All in all, an exceptionaly graceless specimen. But he does have his own principles... and he can be useful sometimes. Right now he can be useful to you."
519911, "Where is he hiding?"
519912, "His lair is at the northern warehouses. You be careful there though, it's the bandits' domain, after all."
519913, "I can hold my own."
519914, "I know him already."
519915, "Then go ahead and trade with him. He's got everything, from cannons to antiques."
519916, "Okay."
519917, "There will come a day when I'll ask you for help."
519918, ""
519919, "Are you Big Vlad, the owner of this house?"
519920, "No."
519921, "I'm but a poor postman, you see... Tasked with delivering a letter of utter importance. Yet I was told he would only be here at eleven."
519922, "Does this letter by any chance refer to one Burakh?"
519923, "I haven't read it!"
519924, "Yes you have. You're such a lousy liar even a mask can't conceal that."
519925, "Okay, all right... No, the letter refers to one... Bachelor Dankovsky, who has come to the town for personal reasons, but will soon take on the responsibility of dealing with Simon Kain's mysterious murder!"
519926, "Thank you, mate."
519927, "Too bad."
519928, "I'll wait next door."
519929, "Do I look like him?"
519930, "In all honesty, absolutely not. I just thought you may represent him."
519931, "Tough luck once again."
519932, "What do you want?"
519999, ""
520000, "Master Burakh! We have prepared a shelter for you."
520001, "Nice to hear that."
520002, "You mustn't think that we're shutting the door on you though. We'll always be happy to accomodate you at our place. My sister and I have persuaded our father that The Lump should become your fortress. But your enemies are powerful. Invisibility will protect you from them."
520003, "What kind of shelter is it?"
520004, "It's your father's secret laboratory. The place is modest, but well-hidden from prying eyes. I'm not sure... mmm... what exactly you're planning to do there, but if at least a tenth of Katerina's... mmm... prophecy comes true, then you'll need a secluded hideout."
520005, "That is exactly what I need."
520006, "Moreover, I have spoken to Bachelor Dankovsky. He is taking a lot of interest in your affairs lately, and he seems to care about you personally... He dropped me a hint that you may need your father's potion-brewing apparatus. It is there."
520007, "Is it that same device that my father used?"
520008, "Yes. You may remember the extraordinary properties of the herb called twyre. Can you smell the spiciness in the air? It's twyre. Twyre is extremely rare, but using said device a skilled person could... Well, you'll get the hang of it soon enough."
520009, "So that means people do know about this place, doesn't it?"
520010, "I cannot say for sure if Isidor used to bring his apprentices and... mmm... strangers over there, of course. But knowing his character, I would assume that he did not. I don't think so-I myself found out about it by coincidence. It's really well-hidden."
520011, "Fine. Please show me where it is."
520012, "Let's hope I don't get ambushed there."
520013, "That fills me with enthusiasm. Farewell."
520015, "No problem. If I ever feel that I'm missing company, I'll find some."
520017, "Am I in need of it already?"
520019, "I wholeheartedly wish you luck, master Burakh!"
520020, "Where can I obtain twyre?"
520021, "You can gather it yourself, of course-thankfully, it's more than plentiful this year. Even the old-timers don't remember anything like this... But it takes time. If the year is bountiful, a professional gatherer can spend a day just to find five or six blades. This year, however, you could gather fifty in the same time!"
520022, "That means there are professional gatherers, right?"
520023, "Of course. It's an art, people dedicate their lives to it. Oh how they cherish their twyre... They grow it, watch over it, nourish it and give it beautiful names. They whisper it out of the ground, they sing songs to it. And it all works!"
520024, "How do I find them?"
520025, "There are quite a few huts scattered across the Steppe. The nearest one is in Earth, to the south-west of the Gates of Sorrow. Those are the more oblivious ones... The ones in the Stone Yard and in the Steppe behind the Station are better at hiding. It would be better for you to seek out the ones by the Gates."
520026, "I hope it isn't too far away from the town."
520027, "The gatherer's hut? It's between the Gates and the Cemetery. Just a few steps into the Steppe."
520028, "Then I'll find it easily."
520029, "Okay."
520030, "Thank you."
520031, "It takes forever... how much longer do I have to wait? It's starting to get dark around seven here, you know?"
520032, "Yes. That's what September is like in the north."
520033, "Go! There are quite a few glorious deeds waiting to be performed!"
520034, "Go to hell."
520035, "You know what? They're all disgusting. Don't sweat too much doing things for them, think about yourself."
520036, "You think about yourself."
520037, "This is the cemetery lodge. Capella says that a kind girl, the daughter of the late caretaker, lives here."
520038, "Capella says that Notkin, the urchins' leader, is not as bad as he's trying to seem. He won't believe the false rumours about me."
520039, "'The Killer of Simon; The Killer of Isidor...'"
520040, "They say I am a patricide. The whole town has risen against me. Who would agree to talk to me now? Who is going to teach me how to defend myself? Olgimsky suggests that his children may have some valuable advice: Victoria and Vlad the Younger."
520041, "Here lives Vlad the Younger, Olgimsky's son. I think his father isn't very happy with him... Still, better to get acquainted with him."
520042, "Have you talked to my father? He is waiting for you. It has to do with your business and... your safety."
520043, "What about you? I'd like to hear what you have to say."
520044, "Don't worry. I'm on my way to see him."
520045, "Our family is strict about good conduct. I don't want to be rude, but I have to respect my father's polite request. His needs are urgent; mine aren't."
520046, "Have it your way."
520047, "Grief, the head of the smugglers, is runnning illegal trade. I can always get weapons and contraband twyrine from him."
520048, "Some bachelor Dankovsky has arrived from the Capital. He quickly set about looking for the person who killed my father and Simon... and he thinks that person is me."
520049, "Has anyone come round looking for me?"
520050, "Oh, yes! There's been this smart alec! A pushy guy, spoke through his teeth... “If I catch this murderer,' he said, 'I'll squeeze out his blood drop by drop, since he's destroyed my whole life's happiness!” Remarkable guy. Not to be messed with."
520051, "Is he dangerous? Drop by drop, you say?"
520052, "That's what he said! I'm not saying anything! We said there'd been no one like that around, and we didn't know anything about a murderer. “I'll go to the thieves then,' he said, 'they'll be glad to trade his head for some shiny coin.”"
520053, "What else did he say?"
520054, "Said he wasn't afraid. 'I know he's keen on tearing people to tatters,' he said, 'but he'll have a different sort of conversation with me.' Turned up the flap of his cloak, and there was a revolver underneath!"
520055, "I see. Thank you, Notkin."
520056, "So he's looking for me..."
520057, "He is. Said there'll be no mercy when he finds you. Looks like he and Grief have set up some kind of trap for the murderer... Anyway, he said he'd off Simon's murderer before the day was out if it cost him his life. “If he finds me before I find him,' he said, 'it's a fatality. And vice versa.'"
520058, "Well, none of that has anything to do with me."
520059, ""
520060, "That's a nice rat, so swift! Here's the money. We've got a fair business here!"
520061, "Take care of it."
520062, "That's a relatively honest income..."
520063, ""
520064, "Your rat sucks. We'll feed it to the dogs. Or do you want it back?"
520065, "You slackers! It took me a lot of effort to catch it!"
520066, "Keep it."
520067, "Set it free. Let it live. "
520068, ""
520069, "Watch your rat! Otherwise we're gonna cheat."
520070, "Don't you dare!"
520071, "You'll cheat no matter what..."
520072, ""
520073, "Ok, look! Here's a new amusement. Rat races! There are always three rats-let's call them Smarty Pants, Easy Game, and Beggar. Smarty Pants is running along one track, Beggar is simultaneously-simultaneously, geddit?-running along another, and on the third track... "
520074, "I got it, I got it. Go on."
520075, "Obviously, the rats are different each time. It's about the tracks. Say, a rat took the Smarty Pants track; it has to pass all twelve checkpoints. If it comes first, it wins. If you were smart enough to bet on it, you win. That’s it."
520076, "How do I place my bet?"
520077, "You don't. You only bring the rat. Your rat's track is the closest one. If it wins, we'll buy it from you. We'll give as much as 500 coins for a strong rat!"
520078, "And if it loses?"
520079, "Then we take it away. Ha ha ha!"
520080, "Makes sense."
520081, "Sounds stupid."
520082, "That's not enough."
520083, "Well, we are no Croeses... There's a ton of rats running around, and a coin saved is a coin earned. We only hope that after a short while we'll select the nimblest ones and it'll become hard to defeat them. Risk mitigation. Geddit?"
520084, "I get it."
520085, "Why do you call it Easy Game?"
520086, "What a silly question! Are you a little kid or something? Why Easy Game? Why Smarty Pants? These are just catchy names."
520087, "...Okay. So then what?"
520088, "Got any? We need the strongest rats!"
520089, "I've got... some. Let's have a look."
520090, "Will any rat do?"
520091, "Get those new ones! The big ones with a grey back. They're the most fun!"
520092, "So what kind do you need?"
520093, "A new breed has appeared recently-they leap three meters long and can bite through barbed wire! I wonder where they came from?"
520094, "No need to wonder..."
520095, "I don't like rats."
520096, "Okay."
520097, "...The closest track is the Easy Game one, I assume."
520098, "But of course! Ain't you a fast learner!"
520099, "Anyone can see that..."
520100, ""
520101, "I'm feeling so bad..."
520102, "Why do you have tears in your eyes?"
520103, "Mark is mocking what is going on in the theatre. He's got some show-booth going on there. He declared that tonight will be a wonderful night, and today the people will see some new underground prophet. One, who controlled the prophecy pantomimes."
520104, "Can that be a reason for sorrow?"
520105, "That is very bad. Mark is inviting any, who wish, to speak to their dead parents. All of the children of us, that have returned, say that it is all correct. But I know that Mark is an excellent trickster! Why is he doing this?"
520106, "Do you miss your mother?"
520107, "Oh, what if this is my only chance to hear my mommy! It would be no good letting such a chance go... But I'm so afraid that it's only a show and Mark's pranks... then I would insult my mother's memory. I will be forced to kill him!"
520108, "Calm down. I'll go and take a look. Perhaps this Mark will reveal to me, what he is hiding from the others."
520109, "Oh, please! The main thing - find out whether it is clear lie or not. He will probably be scared to play tricks on you."
520110, "Yes, I'm not someone to play with."
520111, "What kind of prophet?"
520112, "So I'm thinking, what if it's all correct? Cause the pantomimes did come true! Nobody knew how Mark manages to perform such things. We thought it was a masterful trick. But now that he declared that there is a being that is a kind of emissary of the two worlds there..."
520113, "So what?"
520114, "Don't go there, Kapella. It's only a bad joke."
520115, "I thought so... But why did Mark need such a thing?"
520116, "Sometimes our dead relatives speak to us in our sleep."
520117, "But that's not for sure. That could be nothing more than our imagination..."
520118, "Not for you."
520119, "Would you believe some prophet? One can instill anything really..."

520123, "Most respected one? Wanna speak to a prophet?"
520124, "Yes."
520125, "Ascend the stage, please. Don't close your eyes and concentrate. Hold your breath and count to five. All this is only to clear your feelings of any outer interference. Then ask the prophet a question in your mind. He will answer."
520126, "Some stupidity. I'm leaving."
520127, "I'll try. How do I know if the prophet answered my question?"
520128, "Oh, my dear, come on... There is no prophet there. There is no point in ascending the stage, it is even more pointless asking questions. This is simply a prank... For those, who are in despair."
520129, "It is strange that you should play these jokes at a time like this."
520130, "You will be sorry that you dared to play a joke on me!"
520131, "No. I will say that all this is trickery."
520132, "And you will be absolutely correct! Just the word you said it is - 'trickery'! Em... yes... perhaps you want to test how powerful the prophet is? Ask him a question, an answer to which he could know by no means..."
520133, "So, I should go up the stage? Without stepping on the carcass, right?"
520134, "What stupid thetre..."
520135, "Don't judge me too strictly, most honored Haruspicus. All in all, theatre is my competence, same as your operational one is yours... I do what I want, right?"

520137, ""
520138, "See? The works have stopped precisely at the wrong time."
520139, "What happened?"
520140, "The ground crumbled beneath the workers. They climbed down the hole and saw an opening there. Seems like the bottom of this creephole is made of the same hard material that any previous digging efforts died against."
520141, "A creephole?"
520142, "It's a whole cave. Those good-for-nothings tried to convince me they had seen a light there, heard groans and muffled singing. Nonsense... Those worker types are unbearably superstitious... So now they won't go down-not for love or money. Not a single person brave enough among them. Turns out I am once again doing something blasphemous."
520143, "Why?"
520144, "Same reason you're discouraged from cutting dead bodies open... According to them, we're opening the body of the earth, illegally and shamelessly. This sudden discovery has reminded them that Mother Boddho is a living breathing being just like anyone else... Do you fancy this cave to be a part of her digestive system?"
520145, "I'll check that out."
520146, "If you go down there and find out what it is, I'll make it up to you."
520147, "How much do you think you could contribute to an expedition like this?"
520148, "Seven thousand. That is all I can donate these days. And... two recipes. I've acquired them when the Worms were killing their traitors."
520149, "Deal."
520150, "No, that's not enough."
520151, "I will do it free of charge. I'm curious myself."
520152, "Of course not. Are you out of your mind? It's her vascular system!"
520153, "They have a point..."
520154, "So there have been digging attempts before? And they've died? I've never even heard of it..."
520155, "Of course there have been digging attempts. A lot of them. This isn't the first time we've tried to dig a well here-but it's no use. Not a single drop of water. The idea was tossed around that there's sintered sand or whinstone down below... There are always ideas. So I've got a new theory now..."
520156, "So what is down there?"
520157, "I'd go there myself if it weren't for my claustrophobia..."
520158, "I have to admit I'm really curious as to what's down there. I will go and investigate."
520159, "And you will have my gratitude-not to mention the funding."
520160, "I'll need six or seven grand at first-to equip myself. Also a lamp with lots of oil."
520161, "You will have it all."
520162, "I'd like to have it right now."
520163, "I already have everything I need."
520164, "I've been there. Came out on the other side, as you can see."
520165, "Congratulations. So what is it?"
520166, "It's a tunnel someone's dug from under The Theatre."
520167, "Who would do something like that?"
520168, "I think I've met a weird creature there, but it could have been a hallucination."
520169, "Did it look like... a manlike rat, by any chance?"
520170, "Yes! Do you know what it is?"
520171, "...Curious. Very curious. I think it's an illusion. A spectre appearing to very different people on some creature's will... You've fallen prey to hypnosis. What did it say to you?"
520172, "It spoke about my father. It was all very unclear."
520173, "Here is the reward for your courage, master Burakh. Thank you. Let us never mention it again."
520174, "Now that is curious!"
520175, "But who was the hypnotist?"
520176, "Well... No idea. Some people say it's rats. They have special powers, you know... Others say it's the earth-Suok's vapors... More nonsense.... Yeah. Still, it's known for a fact that the illusion appears to The Town's inhabitants from time to time. It's a well-known spectre. We call him the Rat Prophet."
520177, "It's hard to wrap my head around all that..."
520178, "I don't know. There is nothing there."
520179, "A rather old cave. You were right-its bottom doesn't look like soil at all."
520180, "You have my sympathy."
520181, ""
520182, "Isn't it Burakh? Burakh, Burakh it is... I wonder what you were expecting to see?"
520183, "Wait! What kind of creature are you?"
520184, "Me? I'm a prophet. The Prophet."
520185, "Why are you here?"
520186, "Can you not hear your father?"
520187, "No."
520188, "Really? Eh, a hiccup on my part, I guess. Try listening some more."
520189, "What do you want? Why are you mocking the dead?"
520190, "Mocking? Who's mocking? Look me straight in the eye!"
520191, "I can't breathe..."
520192, "Listen to your father's moaning. Or do you not want to find out who took his life? Listen closer! Isn't that his voice?"
520193, "......"
520194, "I feel dizzy... What is it?"
520195, "This? This is the sound of you collapsing."
520196, "......"
520197, "I can hear him all right, but I don't believe it. It's a trick."
520198, "Well, go ahead and prophesize then! Tell me my future."
520199, "It's as straighforward as a shrug. And also very, very sad. Are you sure you want to know?"
520200, "Welp, that was short."
520201, "I just wanted to take a closer look at this thingie..."
520202, ""
520203, "Don't you dare come near me. I'll scream."
520204, "Why? Are you scared of me?"
520205, "Very much so..."
520206, "I thought the Bachelor was staying here?"
520207, "Yes... He is..."
520208, "Well, then he'll protect you if anything goes wrong."
520209, "Then this is the place I've been looking for."
520210, "And so you should."
520211, "Is the Bachelor in?"
520212, "No! He's not... He'll be back after six or even later."
520213, "You're lying, woman. He's upstairs."
520214, "...I'll come back later."
520215, "Go ahead. Scream."
520216, ""
520217, "So here you are... until recently you've been thought to have murdered Simon Kain, fifteen other men whose names I'd be damned to remember, and Isidor Burakh, your own father. Is that correct?"
520218, "Fifteen?"
520219, "Yes. As time went by, the turnskin commited more and more murders; the turnskin whose description somehow fits your features to a tee."
520220, "Oh. It all makes sense now."
520221, "I've been hunting you all day, and just as I was about to finally catch you, I've found out you're innocent of Simon's-and by extention Isidor's-deaths."
520222, "It seems that I'm still thought to have done all that."
520223, "Not by everyone. I'm working on restoring your good name."
520224, ""
520225, "The place is yours. Make yourself at home."
520226, "Is this where my father used to work?"
520227, "Yes. I, personally, have only been here once. There was nothing here then, nothing but tables, instruments, and tools. It seems that Isidor used to spend a lot of time here. Stayed overnight even..."
520228, "If it was him, that is."
520229, "It could have been no one else."
520230, "I hope so."
520231, "What is this bulky device?"
520232, "This is, in fact, the still. I think the apparatus had a different purpose originally, but your father has fitted it into this... This is where herbs are turned into essences."
520233, "This doesn't really look like lab equipment..."
520234, "He used to say that twyre doesn't discriminate. A rather peculiar thing to say, actually, I would have said quite the contrary. I think you'll get the hang of it. How to mix sap with spirits, how to extract oil, how to take care of this monster-it should all be written in his diaries."
520235, "It's too hard..."
520236, "It really isn't. The hardest part is acquiring the right herbs. After that it's more or less standard. Into the still go the herbs-there were experiments with different combinations-out of it comes the essence. You could try it with a single herb too, the spirit is already in there."
520237, "I hope it is just as you say."
520238, "Sure."
520239, "What is that thing on the table?"
520240, "I'm not sure, but I think Isidor used it to work with organic materials... animal tissues, for example. He extracted the required substances from them."
520241, "How do I use it?"
520242, "I don't know exactly. Rubin told me that you put an infected organ into one of its parts and then pour one of the precious twyrine brews into the other. As a result, you get something he called a 'gruel'... ugh! There was other equipment here too, a microscope, for example..."
520243, "Where are they now?"
520244, "Perhaps his apprentices took them elsewhere. I have no idea."
520245, "Thank you."
520246, "The place is grim."
520247, ""
520248, "Oh the torment... Where's that idiot girl, where's the morphine! Is there no one to send for it? ...And you-why are you here? Don't come any closer..."
520249, "Why are you afraid of me?"
520250, "There was a prophecy... Oh, my temples... You are bound to drown our town in blood. The wording is precise. You will make a sacrifice. There will be rivers of blood, and that will be your doing. You will bring back to the earth all the blood that had been taken from it in the past ten years... Go away!"
520251, "When?"
520252, "Mmmm... What? What do you mean, 'when'? "
520253, "When am I to make this sacrifice?"
520254, "Very soon. In a few days' time. I need morphine... Need it now... Just get away from here!"
520255, "Okay. I get it."
520256, "When have you seen this vision?"
520257, "It's always there... The first time wasn't so long ago... A few days maybe. Leave, I'm begging you. I need rest... I want to get off my clothes."
520258, "Okay, I'm leaving."
520259, "Why would I make a bloody sacrifice?"
520260, "To ascend... and take your due place... You will be forced to make the sacrifice in order to fulfill your purpose..."
520261, "Empty and pompous words."
520262, "Oh God... Why is this happening... I need a shot... Get away! Go away... I want to give myself a morphine injection..."
520263, "I'm leaving."
520264, "I don't want that."
520265, "What's wrong with you?"
520266, "Mmmm... My temples, my skull... It's unbearable... Go away."
520267, "I'm leaving."
520268, "Go away, Ripper!"
520269, "Did you really see it? Did you hear the words with your own ears?"
520270, "You won't ever understand. You don't have the high sensors, the nerves a Mistress feels the world with... You don't know these lines, Burakh. It's like trying to describe a smell to a person who has no nose..."
520271, "Oh, whatever!"
520272, "Look, I want to avoid this as well. Help me. Tell me what to be cautious of."
520273, "Mmmmmmmm..... Nothing can be avoided. Impossible. I can't tell. And the sacrifice is hazy. I still don't know what it will be... I just think it's hardly a person... It's got the soul of a person, the mind of a person, but it's not a person..."
520274, "Why do you keep hinting, why can't you just say it straight?"
520275, "That would mean mutilating the reality. Haziness defines shapes... a Mistress cannot lie... There's no other way."
520276, "In other words, that's your way of washing your hands of it afterwards."
520277, "I'm on my way."
520278, ""
520279, "I managed to preserve your inheritance, if only by a miracle. You can take it all now..."
520280, "By a miracle? Why?"
520281, "It was almost taken away from me-the orders of those who are in power. They've still managed to snatch some papers I missed. You would have received an empty box... and a pocketful of debts, of course. But today the box is heavy. There, behind your back. Did you get the key?"
520282, "Yes."
520283, "Take it then. Use it. I hope you'll manage to sort it all out. I can smell twyre or twyrine infusions inside; if I'm correct, then your inheritance is priceless. If the infusions come with the recipes, then it could also become our salvation. There are probably other papers in there too. And I can hear the chinking of coins..."
520284, "Who are you?"
520285, "I am an evil spirit. That's my origin. My name is Aspity. I am quite harmless-compared to a shabnak... I wreak anxiety and fear, bringing the strangling feeling of the times changing. But you make my heart go round."
520286, "Why?"
520287, "I'm not sure yet. What I am sure of, though, is that Fat Vlad is not to be trusted-unlike his daughter. She... she will achieve greatness. Even though she was born of a foul root, her mother was wonderful. I hope she takes after the mother... But Vlad is a swine."
520288, "I am thankful to those who were there to help me in the hour of need."
520289, "I understand what you're saying."
520290, "So the infusions are priceless? Why?"
520291, "'Why'? Because they're made of herbs, of course! When infused and brewed correctly, almost anything can be extracted from twyre. And swevery! No one knows for sure how much it can do. Well, twyre is the most popular drug, of course. White whip, on the other hand, is thinner and more graceful. You won't be able to handle it if you're not ready to work your fingers to the bone."
520292, "Tell me about yourself."
520293, "Thank you for everything. Farewell."
520294, "What were they looking for?"
520295, "I think they wanted to check his notes. To sleuth the killer out. Do you believe that your father was also killed by the disease?"
520296, "They say he had a strange wound in his chest."
520297, "...So you know already? He did. The general consensus is that the wound was left by a shabnack-adyg's claw-that's how the hunt after the maneater started. You've been told already, haven't you? A bad idea..."
520298, "And who are you?"
520299, "You have my gratitude."
520300, "It makes me happy that you came back to us."
520301, "It makes you happy?"
520302, "Yes and no... I see the cruel hand of fate in this. Your father died, and the next moment-enter you. Old Burakh was the person we pinned our hopes on-the hopes and expectations he never would have lived up to... but you can. The Earth has expressed its will. The Kin has said its word."
520303, "What do you mean by that?"
520304, "I'm superstitious. I can't listen to the Earth like Brides do, but I can listen to the Kin. I know how they feel. They looked up to your father, now they'll look up to you. That is, if they manage to survive to learn of your existence at all, of course."
520305, "Why whouldn't they?"
520306, "Because the disease is spreading rapidly. There's nowhere to run from it. The whole Kin-except for a couple of refugees that were lucky enough to be outside when the doors were boarded up-is locked up in the Termitary."
520307, "That's okay. We won't make haste, but we will hurry."
520308, "Who locked them up?"
520309, "Fat Vlad. He claims it's because of a riot. He's lying."
520310, "I'll speak to him."
520311, "Why did they love my father so much?"
520312, "He was an oynon-a wise man. He could tell justice from injustice instinctively. He could feel the lines nobody even knew about. Some of them aren't even described in the 'Tale of the Daughters'."
520313, "Lines?"
520314, "You've forgotten everything... But that's fine. The things you don't remember will come to you naturally. And if they don't, then that's how it's supposed be. You Burakhs aren't the centre of the world."
520315, "That's for sure."
520316, "Okay, let's leave my father be for now."
520317, "Tell me, do you know how to gather the herbs?"
520318, "You won't find anything if you simply walk around looking for it. You have to know the right places. Twyre and swevery are abundant this year, though. Inexplicable! It's just like eleven years ago, when The Cold Tower was built. Basically, you should speak to the Gatherers."
520319, "Who are these gatherers?"
520320, "A caste of sorts. Most of them are Worms-although they are going extinct. They've had this internecine war of sorts recently... When people started buying their secrets from them, they resorted to killing one another. There was this short-lived trend-everyone wanted to try smoky twyrine for a while... and some Worms were tempted to allow this."
520321, "Where can I find them?"
520322, "There were three Worms on the town's border not so long ago... Someone was being hunted, tried to flee the town, and they were waiting for the victim's death. I'll show you approximately where they are, you can go from there. But they don't usually stay in place for long-they travel and break camps for the night."
520323, "Thank you, Aspity."
520324, "Tell me more about the infusions."
520325, "They have a lot of various properties. At the moment, what you should care about most is that they can serve as medicine that's no longer found in drugstores. Some of them can work as protective substances-they boost your immunity, take a look. Some are painkillers. Some quench hunger. Some mitigate exhaustion."
520326, "Not bad."
520327, "Tell me about twyre."
520328, "It transforms any substance. If you want to continue your father's practices, you'll need to stock up on herbs. Some of them are even stronger, you know-white whip, for example."
520329, "I will heed your advice."
520330, "I cannot share your happiness for now."
520331, ""
520332, "Have you come into your father's inheritance yet?"
520333, "What's in it to you?"
520334, "Because it's likely to contain valuable information. I am, of course, quite sceptical towards those... prehistoric practices... But these days anything could be of help-considering the circumstances. Does the inheritance include your father's notes?"
520335, "It might."
520336, "I am currently studying the records of the First Outbreak. If at least a tenth of those accounts is true, then a catastrophe is upon us. Yet Isidor Burakh had found a way to overcome the beast. If there are any notes on that left, they may save us all."
520337, "I see."
520338, "Alexander Saburov-the person that was supposed to pass the inheritance on to you-appears to be a ruthless and obsessed zealot. And he regards you as an enemy, I gather. That's too bad. But I've managed to at least convince him to restrain his ardour for now."
520339, "I'm beginning to like you, oynon."
520340, "The only evidence against you Alexander has is his wife's dream. Everyone in the town believes she's clairvoyant. Yesterday she foretold me quite confidently that I was about to die before sunset, and yet... Oh well. Hurry up and get your inheritance! And don't be afraid of Saburov."
520341, "I'm on my way."
520342, "Don't underestimate Katerina. Thank you anyway though."
520343, "Do I look like a dead person to you?"
520344, "No. But I'd be alert if I were you."
520345, "Right, more wonderful news..."
520346, "I don't know."
520347, "Not yet."
520348, "So? Did you find any notes inside?"
520349, "I did."
520350, "May I have a look?"
520351, "You may."
520352, "......."
520353, "So do you have a plan?"
520354, "I thought there would be more... Never mind. Try to figure out how those formulas work-they might be of some use to us. I do believe you and I will produce better results if we turn this into a collaborative project. Next. I've heard that you're being supported by the Olgimskys, is that correct?"
520355, "Yes, that is true."
520356, "The father is obviously too busy right now, but the son seems to be a reasonable young man. Ask him if there's any equipment in the town that could be used to make these... mixtures. He is likely to know where we can get a distiller of some sort."
520357, "That's a sound piece of advice."
520358, "If you learn how to synthesize those reagents or at least get a sample, bring it to me please. I'll try to examine it and find out how it can be used-if at all."
520359, "Deal."
520360, "I can handle this on my own."
520361, "No. I don't trust them."
520362, "There are many people that would give their lives for these mixtures' secret formulas, oynon."
520363, "No need-I can tell you what they are. These are twyre infusions recipes. Seems like father didn't actually treat the sick with them, but rather used them as drug components."
520364, "You may not."
520365, "What's the point of making a secret out of it? Your father's actions during the First Outbreak were thoroughly recorded, and I have the records right here. I'll get to those recipes sooner or later anyway."
520366, "I can't."
520367, "Fine. Have a look."
520368, "Nothing special about them."
520369, "We're in a tough spot, wouldn't you agree...?"
520370, "I've managed to get a sample of one of the infusions. Have a look. Is it in any way useful?"
520372, "So what is it?"
520373, "Just as I thought. A natural agent. I'm beginning to work on getting a sample of the microbial culture from dead tissue tomorrow; I could also see how the tissue would react to this solution. Perhaps it can be used to fractionate blood; if it can, we may find a way to cure even a terminal patient."
520374, "Why do that?"
520375, "Why fractionate blood? Come on... That's how you make a simple serum. You extract the bacterial culture, then inject it into a bull's or a horse's body. Then we extract the beast's blood with the antibodies that have already been produced by its immune system. We fractionate it too, purify it-and then it may be injected into a human body. The original serum can theoretically be obtained by trial and error."
520376, "I know how serum is made, thank you very much. Why test the reaction of the tissue to the protective solution?"
520377, "I want to see how the microbial culture would react to it."
520378, "I see."
520379, "If we had tissue-treating equipment and a distiller to process the herbs, we could try different components... We'd get what we're looking for sooner or later."
520380, "That's not as big of an issue as it seems. Consider me having everything we need."
520381, "Oh? Then get down to experiments, Burakh. Study the recipes, make infusions, and treat organ specimens with them. In the end you should obtain something resembling... antibiotics. Bring your samples here, we'll check their effects. Come back when you have the first sample. I'll start working on dead tissues."
520382, "So those antibiotics are like... panacea prototypes? All right. I'll bring you good samples when I obtain some."
520383, "If only I knew where to look for those things..."
520384, "I'm sure young Olgimsky knows this town inside out-especially anything that may resemble useful facilities. It was the Olgimskys that have built the Olgimskys' factory, after all. And that must have required equipment. Talk to him."
520385, "We'll see. And we'll find a way."
520386, "Seems like this panacea is going to become crucial to my success."
520387, "I'll get down to that then."
520388, "What are you working on now, oynon?"
520389, "I'm looking for the source of the outbreak. I need hard evidence. Those backwards fanatics are still obsessed with searching for Simon's murderer instead of trying to make preparations for the epidemic. I fear that they're about to tear even more 'maneaters' to pieces..."
520390, "Allow me to offer you a piece of advice then. Go visit my father's house. It's in the Skinners."
520391, "His house? Why?"
520392, "I've been there. It is infected."
520393, "My condolences... But if what you say is true, then you've done me a great favour."
520394, "Happy to help you, oynon. You're doing the right thing."
520395, "Just a hunch."
520396, "You have my sympathy."
520397, "We are."
520398, "I have to finish the deed."
520399, "Aren't you happy to see me?"
520400, "I am happy... It was just a question."
520401, "You should really wrap yourself up better, you'll catch a cold. And what's this?"
520402, "What, am I supposed to bring it back in a bucket?"
520403, "...He knows how to handle the process... I think. And it's all the same to me."
520404, "Okay, we'll see."
520405, "So that I'm not hunted down. He's already managed to tell everyone that the muderer has my features..."
520406, "They say you've got donated blood."
520407, "Nope. Allow me to enlighten you: blood can't be preserved outside of a living organism."
520408, "Someone is wounded and needs blood."
520409, "I told you! Ain't no blood! Could take some from you, but you're not gonna survive that. You oughtta get up to some healing or bring me someone fresher..."
520410, "How do you know?"
520411, "Haven't seen yourself in a mirror for quite a bit, have you?"
520412, "I need blood."
520413, "You're right, I don't feel too good... Do you have any medicine?"
520414, "...Who were you fighting, you unlucky creature? Got ambushed or something?"
520415, "Yes. I was attacked... by five men."
520416, "Go and dig your nose into them drawers. Oughtta find something. Ey, what the hump are they doing... No mercy in them for anyone anymore. Go 'bout breaking people like sticks. Ready to slash anyone on the spur of the moment. Those rabid demons..."
520417, "Thank you."
520418, "Okay... I'll come back later."
520419, "None of your business."
520420, "One sly prick, isn't he?"
520421, "Keep your... stuff. I don't want it."
520422, "I did."
520423, "Oh, man! That wasn't no good thing to do, why didn't you just off him?"
520424, "I didn't do it for you. Put away your reward."
520425, "Yeah! One big cheese doc came by. An outsider. If he stays here, maybe I should make friends with him... He'd make a good replacement for old Isidor. But he'll leave for sure. He went lookin' for you, he did! All in a fury about it, too. In a fury and in a hurry!"
520426, "What did he say?"
520427, "He said he'd kill you! A dangerous bloke, he is. A fop if I've ever seen one, but there's somethin' in his eye... I wouldn't cross him, even with 'em fists of yours. Be careful, mate. He's got himself hard fists too, that bloke."
520428, "I'll look for him."
520429, "What if he finds you before you find him?"
520430, "That's unlikely..."
520431, "Well, if you ain't afraid of him, then I'll tell you where to find the guy. He ain't no fool, that bloke, he-heh... Got all warm and cozy at a sweet lady's place. There's one Eva in the town, up there in the Stone Yard. Maybe you could getcha hands on him there. Hope he doesn't off you..."
520432, "I'm innocent."
520433, "You tell him that. But he won't listen to you. One hard-fisted bloke he is, I can see that... No slow walks with that one!"
520434, "Where can I find him?"
520435, "He doesn't have what it takes to kill me."
520436, "You're looking to put us at odds, aren't you? Don't you worry, I'll speak to him. And no one's going to die."
520437, "That's a surprise..."
520438, "Yeah, I know how that 'somehow' happened..."
520439, "Let's wait until tomorrow, restore your good name and take care of your affairs."
520440, "An hour in the morning is worth two in the evening."
520441, "And how do you know that?"

520569, "Listen then! There was a time when there were neither day nor night; neither top nor bottom; neither sea nor land. There was but one thing in the world, and it was the great Bull, the Father of Flesh, the Carver of Lines, the Bearer of Horns-Bos Turokh. Up from the abyss came Suok, and she filled the world with herself. She devoured all the stars and all the light..."
520570, "...Wait a second. If there was nothing but the great Bull, where did the stars and light come from?"
520571, "Oh, don't interrupt! ...And she devoured the sunlight. Neither fire nor water could harm Suok, neither old age not the abyss itself. It was darkness then. Bos Turokh, the great Bull, had frozen in the darkness; his cry was strong enough to pierce it, but it couldn't pierce Suok. She spread herself further, and there was darkness once again."
520572, "I think I know of this story."
520573, "And so Bos Turokh in his despair opened his mouth horizon-to-horizon and started devouring Suok. Oh, how she struggled trying to flee back to the abyss! And yet she came to be devoured by Bos Turokh bit by bit. To this day she is inside of him, trying in vain to consume him from within his tight embrace."
520574, "That's some story."
520575, "Intriguing, huh? There's more to it. I can feel you moulding this tale out of clay. You want to feed the disease to a bull to see whether it can overcome it or not. That would serve me well. If you succeed, everyone will leave me alone. Want me to help you?"
520576, "Eh... fine."
520577, "Then your way lies towards the Short Block of the Termitary. A very important person will be waiting for you there. She is the Mother Superior, the focus of the Kin's life and will.

522147, "Undoubtedly. It has nothing to do with morals-it's about whether or not they will be able to speak up by the time this town's fate is decided. History loves to weave human lives into chains. Misplace one link-and the whole chain is broken."
522148, "What do the powers that prevent me from seeing Aglaya care for these people?"
522149, "Yeah, sure, See you later."
522150, "Stop being a smartass, Burakh. You don't have to worry about those powers. You don't have to repair human chains. Who dies, dies. You just do your job. If you want to get to the Council, honour your commitment. No one's expecting you to do any better."
522151, "What commitment?"
522152, "You'll pay for these words."

522160, "Then you are out of luck. Don't worry, there are enough smart people in there, they'll probably figure out what to do without you... unless they get into a stalemate."
522161, "I get it. Wait for me then."
522162, "Which people exacly should stay alive?"
522163, "The people who you had been charged with protecting. The people whose fates you have without second thoughts taken into your own hands afterwards. Aren't you keeping the list of all those people in a chest pocked, close to the heart? Or in your... belly-bag?"

We think it would be appropriate to inform you of the conditions of your victory./n/nWe hope you appreciate the fact that the disease is nothing more than an unfortunate coincidence. You should treat this as a basis for your research, for if the outbreak is entirely accidental-as the lack of any outside influence on the town suggests-then it should be comparatively easy to handle./n/nAvoid multiplying casualties. Seek an answer in unorthodox methodologies. The cause of the outbreak is not of a fundamentally familiar nature, so you may need an... adventure, of sorts, to remove it."

522199, "We have been informed that you have composed a set of instructions for the civilians and initiated the preparation of the town to combat the epidemic. You have ordered the establishment of a hospital and an isolation ward, and are working on setting up other institutions-the morgue, to name one-that the town was previously lacking./n/nThese decisions place you in the context of higher responsibility. No longer an army of one, you have decided to mobilise the population to fight the disease alongside you, since your personal accomplishments were not enough./n/nWe expect that the measures you have taken are temporary. Speaking of what may be described as the microclimate of the town, we don't want any irreversible changes to take place. In particular, we hope that the instructions you have issued would not lead to any undesirable moods among the local townsfolk. We would rather avoid mass psychosis, depression, or panic that are sometimes characteristic of situations like this./n/nPlease keep in mind that when we offered to cease the persecution of your laboratory and to facilitate your research, we meant that as a reward for you being able to find a surgically precise solution to the problem. It is of no importance to us if you do it yourself or instigate the Inquisitor to do it on your behalf."
522200, "The Evening Letter from the Powers That Be. Day Four"
522201, "And so the microbe was captured. The formula for the vaccine has been discovered. Judging by the reports we have received, this is the keystone of your strategy to halt the outbreak./n/nHowever, if you would allow us to remind you the conditions of our agreement; your strategy should also accomplish the final goal, which is to reveal the source of the disease and destroy it, to make reemergence of the epidemic impossible./n/nYou gave your word that you will wipe the disease from the face of the Earth, and this is something we would like to count on. Even more so since your investigation of the carrier hypothesis suggests that the outbreak was a matter of contingency./n/nWe approve of the direction your investigation has taken; everything seems to be in line with the expectations we had of you. The only circumstance we find regrettable is that you did not manage to destroy the creature earlier./n/nWe hope you will deal with the source of the infection tomorrow. After it is done, you should report your success to the Inquisitor and return to the Capital. Back at the Thanatica laboratory, you will find a special decree permitting you to proceed with your private studies as well as equity to provide for whatever research costs you may incur."

You must submit to the Inquisitor immediately./n/nIn addition to that, we would like to remind you that although the first and foremost responsibility of the Inquisitor is to halt the outbreak no matter what it takes, we have reason to believe that her particular skillset will allow her to accomplish victory with as little collateral damage as possible./n/nTo clarify our instructions we would like to specify that by 'no matter what it takes' we mean that human casualties should not be taken into consideration. Even if every single person in the town dies, the outcome will be fully acceptable as long as the pestilence is eradicated./n/nThe town itself, however, must survive. Not even minor damage to the settlement will be condoned. The loss of the town would make everything else totally pointless.

I detest hypocrisy, as do you, I believe... Let us make the hypocrites regret their sanctimony. Their smug self-assurance is based on their deluded belief that we will not be able to carry out their orders. Did they advise you to deal with the plague in a manner your conscience would suggest?

522222, "And the conclusion is...?"
522223, "Ideally, you need some hybrid of bull and man. Human antibodies kill the bacteria, whereas bull antibodies prevent them from reproducing. "

522261, "No. By the children."
522262, "That isn't as funny as you might think. If those were Kaspar's Dogheads, then it's all the same-they are nothing more than little soldiers. What do they want from him?"
522263, "He gave them blank cartridges instead of the service ones."
522264, "I think they want him dead."
522265, "Could you find out more and get him out of there?"
522266, "I see. He did indeed collect some ammo-but he didn't want to supply the children with service cartridges. He feared they'd start shooting... Thought the Dogheads may provoke the soldiers into destroying the Tower..."
522267, "They want the ammo."
522268, "Take it! He left everything he had collected here."

522277, "I'm no spy. I need Dankovsky."
522278, "No! We took him out. He gave Khan blank cartridges instead of real ones. And swindling Khan isn't a smart thing to do-his temper is short. He let the Bachelor live for now out of respect. Perhaps the man changes his mind and spills the beans..."
522279, "So, where is he now?"
522280, "They took him to the Works. He'll be subject to extreme interrogation techniques there. Just tell everyone he's not here if you're asked. Especially since that's true."
522281, "Where did you take him?"
522282, "Yep."
522283, "Willing to share?"
522284, "What do you want?"
522285, "Bring us four crowbars, and you'll have it free of charge. Four crowbars mean four dead marauders."

522288, "No, that doesn't sit well with me."
522289, "Yes, it is."
522290, "I find it puzzling that the Bachelor disregards this fact so easily. He's not as spirited as you are. Is there a way to make as much of this serum of yours as possible?"
522291, "No, it isn't."
522292, "Then go to hell! Your loss."
522293, "You could be the one on your way there...."

522296, "Farewell, general."

522298, "Does the cure exist or does it not?"

522300, "It does not."
522301, "What is it made from?"
522302, "I used aurochs blood. An aurochs is a rare creature. You can say they're extinct."
522303, "Manners, general. I'm not one of your soldiers."
522304, "I have neither time nor mood to be mannered with you. Answer the question."
522305, "It's made from the blood of a beast on the brink of extinction."
522306, "I won't."
522307, "Where did you get this blood?"
522308, "At the Abattoir."
522309, "I'm not telling you."
522310, "You are if you are put to torture."
522311, "I know nothing of it."
522312, "Good. That is very good! You deserve a commendation."
522313, "Why?"
522314, "Because now, thanks to you, the Inquisitor has no reason to be here. She can end her short leave and march back to the scaffold. She won't be getting in my way, and that'll make things easier for us."
522315, "To the scaffold?"
522316, "What are you planning to do, general?"
522319, "How much do you need?"
522320, "How much? Hundreds of litres. Enough to cure everyone infected here and send an emergency batch to the Capital."
522321, "That's impossible."
522322, "Ancient blood? What is this rubbish even supposed to mean? Blood can only be living, that you don't have to explain to me. And why is the chance elusive?"
522323, "I know the breed. Facing death and enduring pain come easy to them. They won't reveal the secret."
522324, "Why?"
522325, "The source material is too rare."
522326, "Naturally."
522327, "I've heard that you are a Steppe man yourself. Can you gain this subterranean Foreman's trust and find out how to get the abominable blood?"
522328, "That's the most curious part. Why is it still living and where is it stored?"
522329, "And how are you planning to handle it once we have it?"
522330, "Divine then. Whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is that it would allow me to neither bombard a homeland town nor kill civilians."
522331, "I'll do my best."
522332, "Yes, you do your best. I am waiting to hear from you. Dismissed."
522333, "Don't take that tone with me, general."
522334, "Yessir."
522335, "I? You'll be the one to do the handling. I will simply report to the Capital-mission successful, conscience clear. Obviously, I'll do it over the head of that scheming fox that wants to outsmart us all and profit from it too. She'd have us dance to her tune and make us think we're doing out duty-while playing directly into her hands."
522336, "Don't speak bad of Aglaya."
522337, "I need results. Everything else is secondary. Do you copy?"
522338, "Copy."
522339, "Fine. And leave Aglaya alone."
522340, "She's sentenced to death. Her leave here was the final chance for her to rehabilitate herself. She will be cleared of all charges if she finds a solution and wins; otherwise the verdict continues to apply. But she deserves it fully, so don't worry."
522341, "Deserves it how?"
522342, "I'll keep that in mind."
522345, "That's not what we're talking about at the moment. We're talking about your cure."
522346, "I never concieved it as a tool of someone else's execution!"
522347, "Isn't the possibility of creating a serum enough?"
522348, "Do not forget that I-and that means you-have no more than three days for ad-libbing."
522349, "I know that."
522350, "Soon."
522351, "To kill the Inquisitor, yes. But it's not enough to save the population and localize the epidemic."
522352, "Panacea isn't poison. How are you planning to kill Aglaya with it?"
522353, "It will happen automatically. If she returns to the Capital with her mission failed, she loses her head in an hour. Merry runs the bloody river and all that."
522354, "The invention of a panacea is not a failure, it's a success."
522355, "...But not her success. It wasn't she that invented the panacea, was it? Her mission, by the way, is saving the town from destruction. But if there's not enough panacea, I won't have the moral right to pull back my guns."
522356, "Do you really want to destroy the town?"
522357, "No. Not at all."
522358, "Yet you want Aglaya to die."
522359, "My personal feelings are irrelevant. Only my duty is. I do indeed hate Aglaya. I can foresee her tricking me and turning my weapons against me. She will get what she wants, no matter what I do. I want her off the board-but no one's asking me what I want."
522360, "Good."
522361, "Whew."
522363, "...I have. Why?"
522364, "How deep did you go?"
522365, "I haven't gone far. They seized me almost immediately. I would have died a grim death if not for the Commander. The military came in the nick of time-I'm inclined to think of their intervention as of a miracle."
522366, "Was the Commander inside too?"
522367, "He was. We are best friends now. Why do you ask?"
522368, "Has he taken anything from the Abattoir?"
522369, "Did you take... the blood from there?"
522370, "I didn't. It wasn't the reason why I went there in the first place-I wanted to take a soil sample and talk to the Foreman... He didn't seem the talkative type though."
522371, "Have you taken something? Anything?"
522372, "Who has?"
522373, "Butchers... and those hide-clad thugs."
522374, "Where did they go?"
522375, "I took no notice of it. It was dark. Also I ran inside immediately."
522376, "You are no coward, oynon."
522377, "What kind of ammo?"
522378, "Military. 7'62, I think... Common military rifle ammo. I hope they shoot each other with them."
522379, "They are impossible to get!"
522380, "Take the ones I left at Eva's-the Stillwater, first floor. They probably won't be enough, but at least we won't have to fight the riflemen. Go get them somehow."
522381, "Have you been to the Abattoir?"
522382, "Later. I can't talk in the presence of these little... just get me out of here!"
522383, "Oh well..."
522384, "I'll try. Hang in there, oynon."
522385, "Aren't you bothered by its inhabitants?"
522386, "You see, I have a theory about it... I'm surprised I haven't considered it before."
522387, "Tell me."
522388, "Later. I'll tell you if it proves true."
522389, "Be careful."
522390, "Why would I not, Elder One?"
522391, "You are not brave. You are thick. I can kill you with my breath. I can kill you with my touch. I can burn you with my gaze."
522392, "Go ahed then!"
522393, "I have come to ask you, Elder One."
522394, "Ask once. There is no second question."
522395, "Who killed my father?"
522396, "Why?"
522397, "A question heard! You will have an answer. Becaurse you want knowledge. A suckling craving meat. A spineless creature begging for a heavy burden. You will not withstand big knowledge. I know what you want to ask."
522398, "Why won't I withstand big knowledge?"
522399, "You have asked once already. Get out."
522400, "Test me."
522401, "Really? And what do I want to ask you?"
522402, "I made a mistake."
522403, "I see. I hear."
522404, "Your father was killed by the horn of Bos Nuhdr, a bull massive, red-skinned, his lines fomed by Suok's song. Mother Boddho's warmth, the blood in her earthen womb, or any of the Mistresses will speak to the truth of my words, for they cannot lie.  "
522405, "Your answer clarifies nothing."
522406, "Because you do not know how to ask. You are thick."
522407, "I wish I was sharp like you."
522408, "....!"
522411, "Who is my sacrifice, Elder One?"
522412, "You will learn that in time. How can you know you are worthy of your father's inheritance otherwise?"
522413, "Okay then."
522414, "I have accepted his inheritance already."
522415, "Have you? Are you content with pickings and scraps from your family's feast? If you are, then yes, you have. Ha ha ha..."
522416, "Erm..."
522417, "Show me what you took from the Abattoir."
522418, "Why? We need it."
522419, "You'll have to give it back."
522420, "I want to know where exactly you got it."
522421, "You can't get udurgh blood from below the ground. But you would be able to get enough from the wound if you cut the growth that's been bothering him for some time now."
522422, "Will you leave us alone if we tell you?"
522423, "Deal."
522424, "No. I've come to end you."
522425, "Prepare to die now."
522426, "You may do whatever you want now. You are dead to the Kin all the same."
522427, "That's way too complicated for me, oynon. Could you please use shorter words?"
522428, "Stop making fun of me. My words are way shorter than the chants of your people's backwards beliefs anyway. Anyway... Have you considered that your father may have actually had something... very complex in mind, and not simply a huge beast? Something so recondite that the only way to describe it is with that... term of yours?"
522429, "What else am I supposed to think?"
522430, "How do you know so much?"
522431, "Leave my father alone! I don't want to hear you babble about the things you don't have the slightest idea of!"
522432, "Come now, Artemy... I'm sorry if I came across as condescending. I only want to help. Remember how you helped me when I was running circles in the dark?"
522433, "And you think that you can lead me out of the dark with your educated mind?"
522434, "I kind of do. You shouldn't underestimate my wit. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since I came here. I'm not so sceptical towards your Kin as I used to be. I have confirmed that your chimeras do indeed exist. I just see them... in a different light. In a plainer one."
522435, "I hope your plainness helps you-because it definitely won't help me."
522436, "But my musings can give a nudge to your train of thought. Aren't you interested in what I've found out?"
522437, "Fine. Speak."
522438, "I'm not."
522439, "I've... spoken to a Mistress."
522440, "Which one? There's not a single Mistress in the town that I would trust."
522441, "Even Capella?"
522442, "What do you know of such things, oynon! Do you really share my beliefs?"
522443, "Then your father's will should be interpreted as a metaphor rather than a literal description..."
522444, "No, it should be interpreted literally, oynon. If you don't want to see it that way, then stay out of this."
522445, "So?"
522446, "Well, seems like I've accidentally found the thing that you've been looking for all this time. I'm standing on the verge of an extraordinary discovery."
522447, "Well? Don't leave me hanging."
522448, "I'm going to play a little unfair now. I suspect there is an ancient... archeological bed, so to speak, under this town. The place where the herdsmen of old used to live before the factories were founded-when the Abattoir was twice as tall as it is now."
522449, "And?"
522450, "...Why did you have to impose your conditions on me? I would've done it in good faith-for our friendship. You have offended me, oynon."
522451, "I want you to ask the Foreman about the precise location of this place and point it on the map. I only need him to tell me under which district this... bed lays. Not much, is it? Then, I'll tell you my interpretation of your father's will. I think it'll clear up your confusion."
522452, "I have my own issues with the Foreman. I can barely pry the information I need myself from him."
522453, "I'm in a tough spot myself, Artemy. Don't get me wrong. I've tried everything I could. I don't have another way of finding out what I need. What I can tell you though is I need this information to neutralize the Commander. Or would you rather have him raze the town?"
522454, "No. Of course not."
522455, "You are very unlikely to help me with this, oynon."
522456, "Wrong. Block trusts me-and for a good reason, I must say. And I have good reasons to trust you. I count on your integrity."
522457, "Then help me out, Artemy, and I'll help you back. Try to make the Foreman talk, and if he doesn't... then the Commander won't have a choice but to turn this place into a pile of ashes."
522458, "Hmm... And on the Foreman's integrity as well?"
522459, "Little Victoria told me that he cannot lie-just like she and the rest of those... in charge cannot."
522460, "That is most likely true."
522461, "I don't think it'll actually work out."
522462, "Tell me what you want to know. You can ask me one question. Choose wisely."
522463, "Who did my father have in mind? What is this udurgh creature marked by this brand?"
522464, "That creature is all that you see around you. The Earth and the settlement nurtured by it-from the Abattoir, the house of Bos Turokh and the Vein of Boddho, to the Gorkhon river. They cannot be separated. The town cannot live without the Earth feeding it. The Earth cannot live without the parasite feeding it. A question answered."
522465, "What sacrifice am I meant to make?"
522466, "You will learn that tomorrow if you pass the next trial, Kindred One. Don't get ahead of yourself."
522468, "Any body contains a world."
522469, "Yours doesn't. Mine doesn't. The world in your head is not a world, it is mould."
522470, "He did."
522471, "I have another interpretation of the term."
522472, "Do you?"
522473, "I think that the mysterious sigil in Isidor's will stands for Simon Kain. Your father's friend. A suprahuman. The creator of this town, an architect of inhabited worlds."
522474, "Is that so?"
522475, "I'd like to know what the Olgimsky girl thinks about my interpretation. Capella. I would also like to have the opinion of a person whom I'm not allowed to visit under any circumstances, Katerina Saburova. I want to study this hypothesis at length. Maria may be biased. Ask these women, Artemy. If you're the one doing the asking, they'll talk."
522476, "What exactly should I ask them about?"
522477, "Ask if Simon can be the udurgh. Let it be a general question, a simple yes or no in response will suffice. They're... tricky ladies. They seem to know everything about us in advance... yet their knowledge is vague and devoid of specifics. They see very far and very little... But they'll know what you're talking about."
522478, "Can the Foreman lie?"
522479, "...I don't know. I don't think he can. If he doesn't want to tell the truth, he'll just gloss over the issue."
522480, "Is he dangerous?"
522481, "Very much so! Talking to him is a constant risk. I think he is only waiting for an opportunity to get rid of you. But he doesn't have the heart to just go through with it. So he's waiting for permission..."
522482, "I'll keep that in mind."
522483, "I wouldn't call Simon himself that. He was born a man after all; man and udurgh are different... Had Simon been reborn though, had he transferred his spirit to a new vessel-a body huge, perfect, and able to let others in... then he could have been called that."
522484, "Is that possible at all?"
522485, "I doubt that. But in theory... You're talking about the local ideas and myths, are you not? An 'udurgh' is not the same thing to us these days that it used to be to the Steppe people before. An udurgh is an idea now."
522486, "Do you think the longmark symbol my father used referred to an idea?"
522487, "Ah, so that's what you are talking about... Of course it didn't! Your father most likely meant exactly what the Steppe myths do. But creatures like this no longer exist... I don't think they ever have."
522488, "What you're saying is..."
522489, "If they have never existed, perhaps one day they will? Who knows."
522490, "I don't think so."
522491, "Speak to the Mother Superior about that. She knows more about udurghs. Perhaps she even knows what exactly your father meant."
522492, "Are you sure?"
522493, "An udurgh is a living creature. A deity of sorts. It has have a glimmer of life in it. It has to be able to be born and die. A man can probably be an udurgh for worms and germs, but ewww... so gross!"
522494, "Does the word have different meanings?"
522495, "An idea?"
522496, "A cult, for example. Or a big family. But it's all misguided. The most important aspect of the udugrh concept is that it is a body, a corpus. Does it make sense? If Simon were to turn into a great ship carrying his people away into a better life-and he would carry them on while remaining alive-then he would become an udurgh."
522497, "Creatures like these have never existed."
522498, "I can't leave my smoke and mirrors be."
522499, "Why not?"
522500, "Because I cannot lie when it comes to details... My lips literally cannot enunciate something that is untrue. Riddles and vagueness leave me a degree of freedom."
522501, "Then tell me what you can."
522502, "I know for sure that you are to destroy a woman, a beautiful woman... a woman that loves you already... Isn't that enough for you?"
522503, "It isn't. That can be anybody."
522504, "A commonplace fairy-tale bit... The one whose existence you so eagerly endeavour to preserve and the sacrifice that has to be made for that are alike. They are reflections. See? I can do the mirror without the smoke... You'll know what needs to be saved when you know what needs to be sacrificed."
522505, "Tell me about my sacrifice."
522506, "What can you tell me?"
522507, "Well, thankfully the last requirement excludes me at least. I hope your knives will pass me by. Look for the udurgh among the people, not the chimeras."
522508, "Can a person be an udurgh?"
522509, "Some men are larger than men... Now leave me. Your presence makes me terrified. You stink of blood."
522511, "The one stinking of blood here is you, you cruel ruler!"
522512, "I know what an 'udurgh' is all right. Can't be so sure about the others. You can't just ask everyone around, got it? They'll tell you all sorts of stuff..."
522513, "Do you know who my father had had in mind when he used that brand?"
522514, "Nope... You never know! Perhaps he had nothing in mind. And nothing on his mind, too. At all!"
522515, "Can it be that the udurgh is a man, Simon Kain?"
522516, "Simon Kain? How is he a man? I mean yeah, of course he can-he can be anything! I don’t know for sure if he's the udurgh or not, but he had to do with it. He had grown a tumour on udurgh's body! That's what Daddy used to say. 'The old man's grown a tumour on the udurgh's body.' Got it?"
522517, "Not really. What does that mean?"
522518, "Well, I mean, he didn't do it all by himself, he had help. Mostly Dark Nina's... Oooh, I know! Maybe one udurgh smothered the other? That would make a lot of sense. Two heads can't live on one neck, as Notkin likes to say."
522519, "You are talking in riddles. Can you be a bit more straightforward?"
522520, "That would make me lie! Do you want me to lie?"
522521, "No, I don't."
522522, "And why not? Go ahead!"
522523, "The udurgh is you!"
522524, "Very funny."
522525, "How do you know that I've been asking around?"
522526, "A little calf told me, uncle Burakh! My guards tell me everything."
522527, "Tell me, is it posible that Simon Kain is an udurgh rather than a man?"
522528, "And how did your daddy know that?"
522529, "Daddy? He knew everything, duh! He even knew how to read and write."
522530, "So, Simon had grown a tumour on his body?"
522531, "That I didn't say! And neither did Daddy."
522532, "What did he do then?"
522541, "What do you want?"
522542, "Bring us four crowbars, and you'll have it free of charge. Four crowbars mean four dead marauders."
522544, "What are they dying for?"
522545, "It's 'who', not 'what'. For Jemmy. That sin is wholly my responsibility."
522546, "All right. I don't like that lot myself."
522547, "No, that doesn't sit well with me."
522549, "As usual."
522550, "I'd like to take a look."
522551, "A body that contains the world-what else could it mean? This is what we call the flesh of the gods that inhabit the earth, holding its bones and its blood and its sky and its living brood."
522552, "Can a spirit be called an udurgh?"
522553, "Why are you asking me? It is I who should be crawling before you, beggind for answers..."
522554, "Yet I am asking you."
522555, "You are testing me, heir. I understand. Obviously a spirit cannot be an udurgh-it's rather the opposite of the word. The 'udurgh' brand literally means 'flesh' or 'a vessel'-something that the spirit lies within. Something that's essential for the spirit to be able to walk this earth."
522556, "Why indeed. I have nothing more to ask."
522557, "What do you think of those who consider an udurgh to be nothing more that an idea, a symbol? Who claim that it's applicable to any creature whose mind has come to know the size of the Universe?"
522558, "I'd call that person a nursling that is yet very far from becoming a Mistress! I know who's whispering this nonsense in your ear. Don't you listen to the Olgimsky girl! ...Or perhaps I'd call this person a heretic that laughs at our fathers' beliefs. Then this person deserves death."
522559, "Enough. I get the point."
522560, "I don't want to kill children of Boddho."
522561, "Then I'll send Worms after them. When they return, I will answer their questions."
522562, "They won't ask for knowledge."
522563, "That will be of no difference to you. Knowledge should be paid for in blood. Pay, and you will get it-along with a gulp of Bos Primigenius's blood."
522564, "I will be back later."
522565, "All of them?"
522566, "Yes."
522567, "Could you be more specific?"
522568, "The settlement is dying, fool. Your father knew that the town would be attacked by the plague. He thought not of the people, the tiny parasites on the skin of Bos Turokh, but of the udurgh, a creature so huge that moon catches its sight and changes its shape into a crescent to greet its counterpart, with its flesh proudly spread upon the Earth!"
522569, "Are you telling the truth?"
522570, "You are not only thick, but impudent as well. Your question is so preposterous that it is not a question at all. How am I to lie, Halfblood One? Neither he who wants to imagine a tall tale, nor he who wants to conceal the truth can tell a lie. Our nature is the warden of our conscience."
522571, "Are you saying that men are incapable of telling lies?"
522572, "He who has abandoned his roots is living a lie with every minute of his existence. But a child of Boddho cannot lie. Why, Burakh? What is he who is nurtured by the Vein of Boddho to fear? What is he who has grown into Bos Turokh's flesh to be ashamed of?"
522573, "I have heard the answer to my question, Elder One."
522575, "What exactly have they betrayed?"
522576, "He who takes this blood from the depths of the House of Boddho is ripping at Mother Suok's flesh! They have bared a sharp knife, cutting themselves off from Bos Turokh's body. They are not longer Kin to us. They can die."
522577, "Why did they steal the blood?"
522578, "You ask too much, son of Burakh. I thought you wanted to ask me one question today-the one which is worth a thousand others. Do not waste your breath on idle words."
522579, "The spirits will talk to me?"
522580, "I will give you a drink now. You will feel hunger at once. You will feel pain. You will go to the Ragi Stone and fall asleep against your hunger pangs. You will sleep until a spirit tells you what their trail smells like. Then you will find them. You will kill them. You will return."
522581, "Do I absolutely have to kill them?"
522582, "No, I won't do that."
522584, "How can I find them?"
522586, "How am I to find them?"
522587, "A hungry man has a better sense of smell. You must be hungry to kill them. Hunger cleanses. Food desecrates you. Bringing back the sacrificial blood isn't worth it with a stomach full of food. The blood will return dirty and won't do us any good."
522588, "Will I be allowed to eat when I kill them?"
522589, "When you bring back the blood and get it back. Not before that."
522590, "Where are they?"
522591, "What will become of this blood when I bring it back?"
522592, "When it is cleansed, I will give it to you."
522593, "Where are the butchers?"
522594, "What is that drink?"
522595, "It will cleanse your guts. To bring back the blood, you must be clean. Don't you dare take any food. If you take as little as a bite, blame yourself."
522596, "I won't drink your poison."
522602, "I'm sorry."
522603, "Rest in peace."
522628, ""

There is no other way, since the two are correspondent to each other. Crush the Polyhedron-and rivers of blood will flow, the underground ichor emerging from within the hollow rod on which the Tower stood./n/nThe second pair means: if Aglaya is your sacrifice, then Simon is your udurgh. In this case you have no other choice but to protect the Polyhedron./n/nI am staying in the left wing of the Termitary, come and see me if you please. My plan is the only one that is feasible./n/nNothing will have to die."
522717, "Clara's Letter"
522718, "This is to remind you of how the Inquisitor has deceived you in regard to the udurgh, which is none other than Simon Kain, the last patient your father ever had./n/nI am well-prepared to explain the situation to Block, although as of now I  have had no such possibility because of the mutiny. The logic behind the whole affair is quite straightforward: if we destroy the town, the Inquisitor dies. If the Inquisitor dies, the Polyhedron will be saved./n/nEvery fibre of this woman's being is dedicated to one purpose: eliminating the Polyhedron. She would not hesitate to die if this would lead to the destruction of the Tower. No one can vouch for its safety while she is alive./n/nIf the Polyhedron remains intact, Simon's existence would likewise be protected, and the supreme creature your father spoke of will be formed. You will fulfil your father's dying request and in doing so resolve the whole situation./n/nI hope you may see that my logic makes sense, even if my presentation is muddled./n/nD. D./n/nP. S. Please find an opportunity to see me if you require further proof of my correctness."
522719, "The Bachelor's Letter"
522720, "I was. If I'm captured and taken off the board, then the Commander will be free to make his move. If you choose Capella's path, then I'll live. If you choose Clara's or Bachelor's path, then you'll lead me to the scaffold and fulfill your purpose."
522721, "I'm confused. What should I do?"
522722, "Were you really lying to me?"
522723, "It's not my place to advise you. Any word I say will be considered an action. I want you to be free. You are the only one here who is stronger than me."
522724, "I never told you the whole truth. Is that a lie?"
522725, "Yes."
522726, "No."
522727, "I'll follow my heart."
522728, "These powers than barred us from seeing each other in the morning-what were they?"
522729, "Have you been to the Polyhedron? The Theatre? You haven't, have you? "
522730, "No."
522731, "How does Capella's path save you?"
522732, "What about the Commander?"
522733, "He is my equal. And I become stronger before him, but before you I weaken..."
522734, "Right..."
522735, "Die, Inquisitor. Here and now I shall fulfill my destiny and inherit my father's burden. You are my sacrifice."
522736, "Speak to her yourself. But she is the only one who can help you keep this town alive. And this is essential for saving me."
522737, "What's the price of this solution?"
522738, "You know the answer. The Polyhedron-the cause of the Plague-will be destroyed. That is what Alexander Block demanded. He has to spend some ammo for his report. The town will survive... that is my pardon warrant. This is how you fulfill your destiny."
522739, "I kept from you my desire to crush the evil Tower. But you could say I had no obligation to reveal that..."
522740, "As you wish."
522741, "What, you surrender just like that? Or are you keeping some hidden ploy as a last resort?"
522742, "I won't fight you... They chose just the right weapon. Anyone else I would have led into a trap-but before you I stand meek and silent. Do what you have to do."
522743, "Go to the Capital. Your well-earned punishment awaits you there."
522744, "Wait. Let me collect my thoughts..."
522745, "So the butchers are expecting your murder. And then what, they let me reach the sacrificial blood?"
522746, "...And make you their ruler. Foreman of the Cult and head of the Kin. You will restore the Kin and bring the town back to life-after you take the place that should have been your father's."
522747, "Do I really have a choice then?"
522748, "You do, and you know it. I'm so happy you didn't have to learn it from me!"
522749, "I know nothing."
522750, "Fine. I'll think it through."
522751, "Nothing? Then I will stay silent. Let Capella speak."
522752, "What does she really want?"
522753, "What is the Bachelor's choice?"
522754, "Talk to him. There is still time."
522755, "And yet?"
522756, "The Bachelor intends to exact his revenge on me for... using him. He wants to do it all the other way round-demolish the city, keep the Polyhedron. If you lead him to victory, you may consider your sacrifice made. You return to the exultant butchers, triumphant."
522757, "I'll ask him myself."
522758, "No. This won't happen."
522759, "But... the sacrifice?"
522760, "My head is splitting. Two possible variants of my life have now crossed."
522761, "I feel for you. It's one of these moments when no one but you can decide what was your destiny. Choose a future, choose a past. You are free. You are the only free man I see here. It's how I fell in love with you."
522762, "The town is my udurgh. Then my sacrifice must be the Polyhedron. You are my sacrifice. Then my udurgh must be Simon, preserved insidethe Polyhedral shell."
522763, "The destruction of the Polyhedron is quite an adequate sacrifice. The butchers may bar you from reaching the blood, but you'll be able to take it on your own... Although I should refrain from offering you any advice. My advice is dangerous."
522764, "I must think now."
522765, "Wait here. I'll go and speak to the others."
522766, "What is Clara's choice?"
522767, "Speak to her yourself. She offers a miracle... for a high price. A bloody price. Their will is now enslaved by the mirror trap. They know not what they do, these... madmen. The Tower turned them into benevolent murderers. For this is the true purpose of it-to bring death and sorrow."
522768, "I'll talk to her."
522769, "Yes, that's true."
522770, "You didn't tell me you were the sacrifice the Kin expected."
522771, "See? You found out everything all by yourself. I never resisted you. Trust me, all I had to do to keep you in the dark was endeavour to do so. Imagine-you make your sacrifice, and at first you don't even notice that the butchers never accepted your offering to the Earth. And then, one day, you do... But I'm far away by then."
522772, "I believe you."
522773, "No. I still don't believe you."
522774, "And that means what? We are all toys?"
522775, "But the udurgh is no man. The thing you save and the thing you sacrifice must be proportionate to each other."
522776, "Simon was almost human. And me-I'm not quite human. Haven't you already had a chance to convince yourself of that?"
522777, "How?"
522778, "Tell me, did the heavens open up? Did the Focus of this town show? Did these... hands... reveal themselves?"
522779, "I don't understand."
522780, "Oh, that... And how are you different from the rest?"
522781, "Because I am a doll that is smarter than its children. I'm a bit closer to them than... to you. You might call me half divine."
522782, "I can't and I won't agree with that."
522783, "And so all the pieces fall into place."
522784, "So you're a product of imagination. A made-up illusory creature. You don't exist. You have a fate, but not a future."
522785, "Yes. Exactly. Not a pleasant surprise?"
522786, "I thought I was a person."
522787, "I didn't know myself at first either. My only advantage was that their mother took me to bed with her when she was young. I know many things they don't."
522788, "So you are older than me?"
522789, "Never thought about it. It's not like we have age. New ones are better than the old, that much I know for certain. But they restuffed me not long ago and made me a new dress-see? That probably makes you a bit older than me."
522790, "What did we ever do to them?"
522791, "Me? They hate me. And I loved them so dearly all my life... when they were still little babies, I dreamt about how they will grow up one day and finally start playing with me... Instead they loathed me from the very start. Was it because their mother wanted them to like me?"
522792, "And the Plague-is it a game they play?"
522793, "No. The town is a toy, but the Plague is real. Go outside, walk the streets... you'll see. Their make-believe has nothing to do with it. They are scared to death themselves. They just came home from a funeral... I don't even know who died yet. Maybe that's the real cause of all this?"
522794, "I refuse to believe that!"
522795, "Who said that? I can hear the voice... but I don't believe it is the voice of my beloved."
522796, "It's me, the player. Wanna chat?"
522797, "No. I don't. I want to be with Burakh. Go away."
522798, "You misheard. Doesn't matter. Keep looking at the Haruspex. It's a nice model."
522799, "Did you fall in love with him because he was free? But that wasn't him; it was me. When I leave, he'll turn into a stuffed dummy-same as everyone else around you..."
522800, "Fine. I'm leaving."
522801, "...Really?"
522802, "No, no. Just tempting you."
522803, "Yes."
522804, "Get out of here! Scram! I won't talk to you any more. I need my Haruspex."
522805, "As you wish."
522806, "Hey, gorgeous? Hey...?"
522807, "Which means damn you to hell!"
522808, "Can I fix this still?"
522809, "There's very little time left. Only fifteen portions of the concoction could have been produced. If you've collected them all, then good for you! You're welcome to make the rounds. Offer the medicine to the vulture-faced corpsebringers standing watch by the doors, waiting to hear the owners' last breath... All is not lost yet."
522810, "Wait for me."
522814, "We are not going to wait for too long though. Time is in short supply. You have until ten o'clock."
522815, "Go to hell!"
522816, "That is precisely what I mean! You are incredibly sagacious, Artemy Burakh."
522817, "What? At least one? You gotta be kidding me..."
522818, "We have every right to do this, too. It's our Theatre, not yours, isn't it?"
522819, "Okay. I'll bring your actors back to you."
522820, "Don't try to bribe them into leaving their posts. Don't stoop to begging. Guarding your dying is a pleasure to them, not a burden."
522821, "They are not mine."
522822, "That much is obvious..."
522823, "Oh yes they are..."
522824, "Up yours...!"
522825, "I'll find another way."
522826, "Fine, I'll find another way."
522827, "You pricks!"
522828, "Not from this distance. That is out of the question."
522829, "Then wait for me at the Cathedral."
522830, "What happens if I don't come to the Cathedral?"
522831, "The Inquisitor and I will have a conflict."
522832, "Take my advice. Beware of the Inquisitor."
522833, "Why?"
522834, "No matter how hard you struggle, an Inquisitor will always find a way to trick you, and there's nothing to be done about it. An Inquisitor can always use you in their interests so that you won't even notice it. And that's exactly what is going to happen to us all today."
522835, "Why is the Inquisitor so dangerous to you, general?"
522836, "Officially I don't have the right to fire unless she or even that Bachelor provide me with a detailed report on the hazard situation."
522837, "So?"
522838, "I suspect that the young fox has concealed her major arguments, waiting to reveal them at the last minute. She will most likely do it in such a fashion that I'll have no out and won't be able to open fire. I'm not barbarous. I have no intention to kill civilians unless there are no other options."
522839, "You seem to have enough artillery not to fear a single woman."
522840, "I'll keep that in mind."
522841, "I've heard that one before-and I've already given an answer. I will do as my conscience tells me to. If this aligns with someone else's schemes, so be it."
522842, "That is good to hear."
522843, "I will come to the Cathedral."
522844, "As a matter of fact, I'm fine right here."
522848, "Do you support the Bachelor?"
522849, "Yes, he seems to have reasonable suggestions."
522850, "Like what?"
522851, "Speak to him yourself, surgeon. He is back at his place, I think."
522852, "I wanted to talk to you."
522853, "The Bachelor can speak for himself. As for me, there's nothing to speak about."
522854, "Fine."
522855, "So, Burakh the healer. Your father used to be the leader of the local cast community, which is important to me-it was neither greed nor plotting nor circumstance that has informed your choice, but your conscience alone. I've been given orders to level everything here. But if that's not necessary, I am willing to trust your judgement, risking my life and honour, for I am merciful. Where shall I point the weapon?"
522865, "True. That's what I've been told... Victoria Olgimskaya, styled the White Mistress despite her young age, confirms that you are capable of accomplishing this goal. The people you have saved support your claim. Act then. The cannons will rumble at ten to twelve. Evacuate the children from there by ten."
522869, "It will be taken care of. Aglaya will give orders. This is my choice."
522871, "Speak, Clara. Artemy Burakh! Are you sure you have nothing else to tell me?"
522875, "I'm sure, commander. I've made my choice."
522876, "You only have to destroy the Polyhedron to put an end to the disease spreading. There's no point in razing the whole town."
522878, "There's no need to destroy anything. We can do altogether without gunfire and preserve this world as it is."
522879, "Look, look! Haruspex is here! He's so big! How did you find us? Oooh, so lifelike... and sooo angry!"
522880, "I want you to tell me everything."
522881, "No problem. What do you wanna know?"
522882, "What diabolical game are you playing?"
522883, "Look! It's a magic sandbox! See how it reflects in the mirrors? It's because everything's for real there! Here's a town, we've made it out of sand. And there's this awful thing going on there-an EPIDEMIC! So it's all crumbling... the town is falling apart... But we've sent heroes there to fix it."
522884, "To fix it?"
522885, "It's rotting, see...? Eww. We hoped they'd think of something. Mure it in sand, at least... They're magical to, you know, the heroes are! Take you, for example-look how it all worked out! You used to be a doll and now you're alive. Perhaps the rest also work like this?"
522886, "Did you know that your dolls were alive?"
522887, "Everything is alive around here! It's this structure, it brings things to life. it's not like we're twisting anyone's arm... It just happens. All on its own. We only built the town-and then it became miraculous all on its own! And the dolls... We just stuck the throwaway ones in, they were lame anyway. Oops, sorry..."
522889, "Don't you touch anything else around here. And don't stick anything there anymore!"
522890, "Just-just don't you dare crush anything here. I'll try to fix it."
522891, "And what are you going to do now?"
522892, "Heal the town, please! Just look, it's so wonderful... It's alive and it's our favourite one... We won't be able to make another one like this. If it can't be helped, then it will disappear forever. You know how much we love it?"
522894, "I didn't think you could love at all."
522895, "Indeed. I agree with you on this."
522896, "So how did you go about sending the heroes?"
522897, "Show me your sandbox."
522898, "You little pricks! Tell me everything you know before I beat the living hell out of you!"
522899, "Hey, hey, you keep your hands to yourself... Little doll! A litle doll smarting around!"
522900, "Who are you?"
522901, "We didn't touch anyone! We're playing town here! It's so fun, you know. You are there too! Well, we thought you were there, but you turned out to be real..."
522902, "So you thought I was a plaything?"
522903, "No! You aren't our plaything anymore."
522904, "Now that I've found out about you, you are my playthings."
522905, "We'll do as you say."
522906, "Go home and try to start things over tomorrow."
522908, "The sand is wiser than you."
522909, "Show me your sandbox."
522910, "Yeah. I know how fun it is."
522911, "A doll? Me?"
522912, "Yeah... Well, you personally have grown a bit big..."
522913, "I'll rip your heads off."
522914, "Don't be upset. Being a toy is also nice."
522915, "But why did you play it like this?"
522916, "Well, we did need to find some use for you. We never liked you all that much anyway... You've always been the scary doll. Playing with you was no fun."
522917, "So you stuck the throwaways into the thick of it."
522918, "The ones that could fix things! You can't always have a Smart Doctor Man at hand. That's just how the game goes. Will you help us heal the town?"
522920, "I will."
522921, "Get the Commander out of there."
522922, "That's impossible now! We can't. Mirrors make it all very complicated. You can't take your move back once you've made it-these are the rules of a real live game."
522923, "I'd rather it was an unreal dead game."
522924, "Then just don't touch anything."
522925, "Get the Inquisitor out of there."
522926, "I'm afraid you will never know if that's true."
522927, "I hope I can still switch places with you some day."
522928, "Everything happens."
522929, "Then you will know what it's like being a toy in the hands of a monster."
522930, "Only I will be more humane."
522931, "The hero is a doll, but so are the children. The real game is what's happening between you and us. "
522932, "I cannot leave Haruspex's body. You are imposing your limits upon me."
522933, "Haruspex has lost his battle for freedom since the very day he was born. What about you?"
522934, "I wanted to stop the epidemic."
522935, "But did you understand what the epidemic really was?"
522936, "A toy danger that has ravaged a toy town."
522937, "Was the disease the true evil though? The disease is only a method. The evil's weapon-just like a scalpel is yours. The disease will go, devouring itself. Then there'll be war, famine, heresy. Was it really worth the effort? Look around."
522938, "All this-for a single wretched town?"
522939, "No. It was the town that had been built for you, not the other way round. We apologize if it's been a disappointment."
522940, "I still don't get it."
522941, "It had been built so that you could make your final choice now. We are observing you. Everyone who makes it to midnight will have made a choice-one way or another. We want to see what yours looks like. You stll have a chance to change your mind."
522942, "I've made it already."
522943, "Good-if it really was you. The only enemy, the only evil in this story, you see, is called Inevitability..."
522944, "I will be the one to say the final word."
522945, "I don't care about that."
522946, "So you're curious as to what fate I will choose for the town?"
522947, "We have to make sure that it truly is you who is making the decision. Are you absolutely positive that your choice is not predetermined by anyone or anything?"
522948, "I am."
522949, "Could it have been otherwise?"
522950, "Oh, absolutely. When every step you take has been predicted, you are still free to either take it or not. When it has been foreseen, however, you remain a mere puppet in someone else's hands."
522951, "Being my puppeteer is way to good a position for you."
522952, "I don't care. I will do as I see fit."
522953, "That is precisely what we are waiting for."
522954, "I will be the one to say the final word, not anyone else."
522955, "I know now that it was all a children's game in a glass sandbox. But what for?"
522956, "Haruspex is my hands and nothing more. I wanted to see if I can make it."
522957, "That's what we're interested in as well! Can you make it or can you not? Can you make-what, exactly? Could you not have made it?"
522958, "I've made it. I managed to destroy your poisonous evil that has spread thin across the world."
522959, "You see how sad our fortune is. We put all our hopes in you! We poor actors were hoping you'd become the director of a new show-the old one has been beaten to death. But you turned out to be a doll..."
522960, "But I am not a doll."
522961, "Did I hear you right? Who is it speaking?"
522962, "It's me, the player."
522963, "Oh! Then I apologise profusely... You are definitely not a doll, but that seems to be unhelpful for our hero now. He is humiliated, crushed, but most importantly he is deprived of the power that we have all hoped for. By the way, are you still willing to take responsibility for him?"
522964, "Yes. He is my responsibility. I will stay with him to the very end. His words shall be my words. His deeds shall be my deeds."
522965, "Oh... Then I apologise once again. Perhaps not all is lost yet. Let's wait for the finale and see if the day brings any surprises. We still have a chance to play in a drama with an unpredictable story."
522966, "Watch me act."
522967, "Yes. And highlight Haruspex better. It's my solo now."
522968, "No. I don't need a humiliated, crushed, and powerless hero. I'm fed up with it all, actually."
522969, "As you wish. Then with all due respect we will treat him accordingly. If you wish to leave him, then he will not be able to accomplish anything we could worship him for."
522970, "Yes. That is what I wish."
522971, "No. Do as you wish."
522972, "It's me, the Haruspex."
522973, "That was a blow for me too. I thought I was a human being..."
522981, "It's high time we make choices. As for me, before the artillery starts firing, I'm packing my belongings and leaving this town, having grabbed some people I want to save. I could have found my own solution, but I don't have the time..."
522982, "Who are you planning to grab?"
522983, "A few people. They will assist in building a new town."
522984, "What would your solution be?"
522985, "I could make them destroy the Settlement along with the Bull Project-yet the Polyhedron would remain. Block assured me he'd fire a strike so precise that the other shore of the Gorkhon wouldn't be scathed. 'The river will swallow the plate,' he said."
522986, "The people will die if we destroy the town."
522987, "So that's what the true price of your choice was! Do you have any idea as to what happens now?"
522988, "What happens now? Now the efforts of thousands of people, the energy of a wonderful family, and the talent of genuis creators will collaborate to construct a real-life miracle; a miracle capable of pushing humanity towards a new breakthrough and granting us the capability to produce things of genuine beauty."
522989, "So, a new Utopia is going to be built here?"
522990, "Yes. I find it remarkably fascinating, damn it! You know, daring endeavours of this kind seem almost extinct in the modern times... small wonder we're losing the war. People are evolving to become boring and shallow. History passes us by, paying little notice. The world strives to move forward, but we're not pushing it! A shame."
522991, "If the Polyhedron alone caused so many deaths, how much evil will a whole city of incarnated miracles beget?"
522992, "But the price!"
522993, "Everything has a price. Kaina's triumph promises to be ruthless but fruitful. This place is remote; but when a phantasmagoric garden blooms here, it'll give birth to a new Renaissance."
522994, "Rather a lot. Let's be realistic here. Does this mean, however, that we-all of us, the humanity, I mean-should abandon our attempts, efforts, and search? You'll never convince me of it."
522995, "The truth is older than we are. There's no point in trying to invent it. Just repeat after the days of old..."
522996, "Are you aware that we turned out to be toys? "
522997, "Really? You're kidding... Though figuratively speaking... That is true-after a fashion. We are all mere toys in the hands of Providence."
522998, "No, oynon, I mean literally. You are a toy. I am a toy. We are mere dolls made of rags, sawdust, whalebone, and hell knows what else."
522999, "Have you gone mad?"
523000, "No. My eyes were opened. You have owners. They are children. The game they're playing with us is almost over."
523001, "I hope my side wins!"
523002, "No. You lose. They don't love us, by the way. They're fed up with us. That's why we're stuck here... they've stuck us here."
523003, "Very witty, Burakh. Forget it; my laboratory is beckoning to me from the Capital! I can't for too long entertain the thought of it also being a dollhouse. I'm an adult man that has responsibility to bear, you see. I invent medicine that helps with old age and death."
523004, "...Out of nuts, syrup, and sleeping pills stolen from the adults. Don't make me laugh."
523005, "Enough. This isn't funny any more."
523006, "You've failed to grasp anything at all..."
523007, "Oh, look around. There's no one left alive except for the two of us. The infected ones don't count; they have less than twenty-four hours to live in any case."
523008, "I could at least help them."
523009, "A new town? What's going to happen to the old one?"
523010, "Really? Then could you please make it so that I could show up at the Council and present the Commander with arguments in favour of the following arrangement: the corrupt town disappears from the face of the earth, and the Polyhedron stays. It's aseptic and... damn it, it's simply worthy of preserving!"
523012, "I like your decision, oynon. Let Simon be the udurgh. "
523013, "What do you need to do so?"
523014, "No. Not happening."
523016, "Wait for me."
523022, "I'm not ready to make a choice yet."
523023, "That is wise. You will have neither a second chance nor a replay option. I advise caution."
523024, "I'll keep it in mind."
523025, "She lied to me. Fooled by her, I was acting on her prompts the past few days-and I even encouraged others to do the same. My discovery has been reinterpreted and presented in a fashion that has turned truth into lies. I've been violated."
523026, "I will make my own choices."
523027, "Then why did you bring me here at all? I don't get it. I'm giving you solid advice and you are not listening."
523028, "Worry not, oynon."
523029, "So what?"
523030, "Think you're in a better position? She has simply chosen a different tactic for each of us. She has abused my hate and anger. She has abused your love and sense of commitment. I wonder what she did to get to Clara-if she found the Changeling worthy of her schemes at all..."
523031, "...because you're smarter than me, oynon. Is that what you wanted to say?"
523032, "Let's put it this way: because I am more predisposed to logical thinking."
523033, "...And what do you suggest?"
523034, "If you are still fooled by her, how come you speak so confidently? What if it's also a part of her plan?"
523035, "And what do you suggest?"
523036, "I suggest you use the chance she is giving you... Or-or do the unexpected. Although... What if she sees through that too? It's scary to think how far her acuity goes..."
523037, "Really?"
523038, "Perhaps I tend to demonize her-but I am furious about what happened to me..."
523039, "...And you want to keep the Polyhedron intact just to spite her."
523040, "Yes and no. The Polyhedron and the Inquisitor are mutually exclusive. The Polyhedron will stand if she's gone-and vice versa. I suggest you end her. That's how we can keep one of history's greatest monuments for the humankind. It's a sprout of our future."
523041, "I see your point."
523042, "It was lucky enough to reveal her plots-I think that's because I'm..."
523043, "Okay, I get it."
523044, "How do you suggest we destroy her?"
523045, "Destroy the town. That will be her death sentence. She is responsible for it before the Powers That Be."
523046, "I understand."
523047, "I think we should finish her. Block is a tool in our hands, but we are still her tools."
523048, "I've heard all this before. I am not a tool, oynon. I can tell you that with utmost certainty."
523049, "The world isn't as simple as you think, Burakh. I know how to arrange it so that both the town lives and the Polyhedron stands. It will all be just like it used to be!"
523050, "And how will you arrange that?"
523051, "It's a secret. Something has to be sacrificed anyway... a lot, really... but these are things that actively want to disappear off the face of the earth. Nothing to regret about."
523052, "Curious. What are these things?"
523053, "What do you care? They are but fuel that would allow to preserve the old state of being. Oh, the Powers That Be will be delighted. They really shouldn't have persecuted me! I could have offered them a wonderful gift."
523054, "What do the Powers That Be have to do with this?"
523055, "Whatever the Powers That Be claim, they don't really care about the disease. The town, the town, the town-in the precise state it's existing in now-that's their primary concern. The town whose juices flow to feed the blooming and active Polyhedron!"
523056, "And you think you could arrange that?"
523057, "...A chimera! A greedy, insatiable chimera. I'm so happy it's not you who is to make a choice, Changeling."
523058, "What's the cost?"
523059, "Yet another secret! Curiosity killed a cat. My word is enough. I will keep it. I am a mystical creature. I am a Mistress!"
523060, "Are you now?"
523061, "I could arrange it so that everything stays the way it used to if I could get into the Cathedral and look the Inquisitor in the eye. But I can't. I have to care for my... confidants. They have put their faith in me already, you see. I cannot abandon them now."
523063, "Wait for me. I'll take care of your outcasts. "
523066, "Turns out that you're a toy, Clara. And I'm a human being."
523068, "Of course I am! Were you not?"
523069, "I wasn't... and you're so calm about it!"
523070, "How long were you aware of that?"
523071, "I'm aware of something else, too. I am. Almost everyone we've come across in the past few days are toys-honest to God toys. But some creatures here are more intricate..."
523072, "Who? "
523073, "You and me, for example. You surely understand quite a lot about yourself-you feel a powerful will standing behind you... And I'm going to surprise you quite a lot, tee hee... What would you have done if you knew beforehand?"
523074, "I would have acted more confidently."
523075, "I would have shot myself."
523077, "Lil' puppets we are, true... but it's not the puppet that matters, but whose hands control it! Have you seen them?"
523078, "I have. "
523079, "They probably think themselves so big? Think they're real human creatures, lil' baby kids, don't they?"
523080, "...Aren't they?"
523081, "I wouldn't be so sure! I have a gut feeling about it! That's my knack, what can you do. And the Bachelor is probably still thinking he's a bachelor, doesn't he? Hahaha... He would have got on very well with those kids!"
523082, "I doubt that. "
523083, "Tell what you know! "
523084, "I have already told you everything. I don't know anything-but I sense a lot. See you, Ripper!"
523085, "See you... "
523086, "Are you sure? "
523087, "I am."
523088, "No, not really."
523089, "Why? Look at your hands. Are they really yours? No, not these ones... Now count them. Are there exactly two and not four? Hahaha..."
523090, "That's not funny. "
523091, "Do not pretend to be alive. "
523092, "I'm not pretending. But you shouldn't have called me a toy... I'll make you regret that... Tell me, who am I really? What do you think?"
523093, "A doll. "
523094, "...The Plague. "
523095, "A miracle-maker."
523096, "No. That is my doppelganger. My twin sister. "
523097, "So I was mistaken. "
523098, "Whatever I choose, you will immediately change your essence. Is that what you're hinting at?"
523099, "I'm in your head now! This is what I'm hinting at. I am you!"
523100, "Whatever! I'm in no mood to argue..."
523101, "Fine. Score one for you."
523102, "So I'm not human. That gives me a huge advantage over you."
523103, "Why? "
523104, "Because you think I'm a toy. I know who you are, but you don't actually know who I am. So I have an advantage."
523105, "How so? "
523106, "Who were you fighting all this time? Oh you human... "
523107, "The plague. "
523108, "The inevitability. "
523109, "Was I fighting you...?"
523110, "Do you realize now that you have lost? And there's nothing to be done. It's too late."
523111, "All right. Let's go to the Cathedral. "
523112, "I'm tired of you! Your lies are so crafty it's too easy to mistake them for the truth. Even the Inquisitor is less skilled than you... "
523113, "Just wait a bit more."
523114, "I would still like to know how you're going to keep the town intact."
523115, "Burakh, Burakh...! What are you saying? I told you it's my secret. I will only reveal that to the Queens. General Alexander will never compromise, you know that full well. And if I can't persuade Aglaya that mine is the way to purge this world of plague, then nothing happens at all. What is to happen, will happen."
523116, "Seems like you have a strong influence on Block."
523117, "Even if I mesmerize him, he won't forget his procedure. Don't worry. I'll tell the Queens everything-separately, of course... But not to you. I don't want to see my secret become gossip all too quickly."
523118, "Aren't you afraid of telling the Queens?"
523119, "My choice demands they destroy one another, Burakh! It's all taken care of. Don't you worry."
523120, "Now that's some news."
523121, "My choice is full of surprises, Burakh. Or did you really think this little dilemma of yours was unavoidable? An 'either-or' thing?"
523122, "Look at you talking... It's like you're a different person."
523123, "Perhaps it's not the same me you knew before. There is more than one me... a lot, perhaps. We've got the same pretty face-but who knows whose will is behind it right now?"
523124, "Enough."
523125, "No, I won't let you choose."
523126, "What happens to Aglaya?"
523127, "Aglaya will die."
523128, "Can you make it so that she lives?"
523129, "No. I have no power over that. This is a mandatory part of my plan."
523130, "Then step aside and do not meddle."
523131, "Who else will die?"
523132, "Look, there is no need for prying... You'll make it, don't worry."
523133, "You impudent girl! You are naïve to speak as if you've won already."
523134, "Whatever."
523135, "Why do you think that my victory's impossible without them?"
523136, "You wanted to protect the town, didn't you? But the udurgh is a living being. It's a body that contains the world. And do you really think that the world can exist without activity inside? Who is going to govern it? Who will paint it different colours, tints, and shades? I will distribute these roles among the children when they come of age."
523137, "Tell me what the children I've saved are going to do until then."
523138, "The Mother Superior will start managing the Kin right away-you don't really understand their day-to-day life, do you? You can rule and guide knowledge. If will be the power of malachite and black."
523139, "Go on."
523140, "Notkin will be a scout, exploring the Steppe for now. He will also keep an eye on the Warehouses and the Station-we will have to start communicating with the big world soon. Red gold will be his colour."
523141, "Who else?"
523142, "Murky will look after street improvements. The town must look pretty. I will also assign her to be in charge of the water supply and the sewage. She will become the Lilac Mistress. "
523143, "Very nice."
523144, "Sticky will be in charge of commerce. He'll be the chief merchant, controlling all shops in the town and making sure everyone has everything they need. He will become a ruler later... just like all the other boys you have saved. His power will be of amber color."
523145, "Right."
523146, "Grace will keep doing her job-she'll bury the dead. They have a whole realm of their own, you know, and they need a caring hand too. She will be a Beige Mistress. The most valuable aspect of this colour is the subtle shade of dawn. A little nuance of pink and lemon.../n"
523147, "And who'll be the head of all this?"
523148, "We will enter into a marriage with Khan. This will put an end to the enmity and the disagreements of our families. We will restore the harmony of ruling. I will become a Mistress and will do what my mother used to. Khan with his army of Dogheads will rule the town. I'll make him white-as I am. "
523149, "Actually, I had other plans for the future."
523150, "I am not going to force you. But I thought you'd become the new Foreman. Since you made him no more, you are the one to take his place. It is not a reward, it is your duty."
523151, "I'm leaving this place, Capella. Today. You guys rule the town without me."
523152, "What of the other kids?"
523153, "A good choice."
523154, "You cannot even imagine how good it is."
523155, "But how will he deal with the thieves?"
523156, "Do you really think that I, Victoria Olgimskaya, the White Mistress, will not be able to restore order? You are mistaken."
523157, "Sorry. I had no doubts about that."
523158, "So that's what the town is going to be like now..."
523159, "Well, nothing to be done then."
523160, "I'm so sorry I can't break your neck."
523161, "No question escapes my lips. I am not asking anything of you."
523162, "We'll leave this place. You and me, together."
523163, "Do you have any regrets about what you have done?"
523164, "No."
523165, "It's impossible to change the choice you've made now, is it not?"
523166, "Yes, it isn't."
523167, "I'm looking forward to midnight!"
523168, "I meant well."
523169, "Don't."
523170, "Wait and see the consequences of your choice. It will all be over by twelve."
523172, "Farewell, General Ashes."
523174, "Regret is the most honest of feelings. Who said that?"
523175, "I don't think I'll be there to see it."
523176, ""
523177, "Why did you come?"
523178, "The Bachelor is putting his hopes in you, isn’t he?"
523179, "Hopes? I have no idea. What does it have to do with the Bachelor anyway? He's played his part-and is now heading off the stage. I will be in charge now."
523180, "Where is your uncle, Georgiy Kain?"
523181, "My uncle will die tomorrow, after he carries Simon's soul into the Focus of the Polyhedron. He's leaving the stage too. He has already made all the choices he was supposed to make. I admire his choice."
523182, "Where is your father, Victor Kain?"
523183, "My father will die today, after he carries my mother's soul into the Focus of The Crucible. He has also departed the world-I'm the head of the House of the Kains now, as you can see."
523184, "How are you going to live with this?"
523185, "I have no husband to hold me back like my father did to my mother. No one can stop me from building what I intend to build-there, on the other side of the Gorkhon! The life that will be begotten here today is none of your concern. You do not know what life is-at all! And so obstain from judgement."
523186, "The door was unlocked."
523187, "Do not despair, Maria. Do not regret a thing. But you will not become the Scarlet Mistress."
523188, "Curse you!"
523189, "Spare me the curses."
523190, "I am the only person here who knows what life is. At all."
523191, "Can't argue with that..."
523192, "Please do not feel yourself obliged to do anything..."
523193, "Who are you talking to?"
523194, "I don't."
523196, "You don't have to do any of this."
523197, "Who are you talking to?"
523198, "I know."
523199, "BULL'S BLOOD."
523200, "PROSECTORIUM BLOOD. The blood that Stakh Rubin had been working on for the past four days. It has an unnaturally vivid crimson colour and seems to glow with some inner light. Could such blood really flow inside a human body?"
523201, "KIDNEY. Human kidney. Extracting organs from a human body is seen as a horrible blasphemy in the local tribal community. Only the menkhu are allowed to do this because they have an ancestral right to cut living bodies. However, some gatherers and also the Hunchback from the Atrium district would be willing to trade for something this rare..."
523202, "INFECTED KIDNEY. Menkhu know how to prepare healing potions by treating organs with twyrine infusions. In this kidney, harmful microorganisms are probably winning a fight against antibodies. The composition is constantly changing. A lot depends on the stage of infection."
523203, "LIVER. Human liver. Extracting organs from a human body is seen as a horrible blasphemy in the local tribal community. Only the menkhu are allowed to do this because they have an ancestral right to cut living bodies. However, some gatherers and also the Hunchback from the Atrium district would be willing to trade for something this rare..."
523204, "INFECTED LIVER. Menkhu know how to prepare healing potions by treating organs with twyrine infusions. In this liver, harmful microorganisms are probably winning a fight against antibodies. The composition is constantly changing. A lot depends on the stage of infection."
523205, "INFECTED HEART. Menkhu know how to prepare healing potions by treating organs with twyrine infusions. In this heart, harmful microorganisms are probably winning a fight against antibodies. The composition is constantly changing. A lot depends on the stage of infection."
523208, "They're expecting a sacrifice."
523209, "What kind of sacrifice?"
523210, "A proportional one. I don't know what can be proportionate to the town."
523211, "Inadvertently."
523212, "The Kin is frozen with anxious anticipation. You are their hope. Perhaps they'll give you the blood now. Long live the new king-after having slaughtered the old one... What else can they do..."
523213, "Maybe there are other ways to get the blood?"
523214, "Perhaps you can think of one?"
523215, "I have a bold idea. The brand denotes the Town-so perhaps the sacrifice should be an anti-Town? The Polyhedron? Hmm...?"
523216, "How is that? Isn't it a part of the town?"
523217, "No. It's a useless, pointless, poisonous abomination. If the Kin believes the Town to be the body of the Cosmic Bull, then the Polyhedron is a knife in that body."
523218, "A knife?"
523219, "If only you knew what the Bachelor's found out for me... I shouldn't get carried away with the thought though. It's all conjecture. Mindgames."
523220, "I have no idea."
523221, "Have you heard the legend of blood puddles that appear by the Polyhedron base from time to time? Children stop playing and become gloomy when that happens. They think it's a bad omen."
523222, "That's none of your business, Inquisitor."
523223, "What kind of sacrifice do they expect from me?"
523226, "Why do you keep asking?"
523227, "Because I want the town to live. It's my duty. The Powers That Be only need the recipe, the formula to success-and the town itself can go down in fire. All they need to do is to wait for a new wave of settlers-and those will be provided with your serum from the get go, don't you doubt that. Why would they want to hear the reproaches of those who went through this hell?"
523228, "I don't want to talk about this... barbarity, this savagery, this superstition. Is it possible to get the blood without making a sacrifice?"
523229, "Why do you care so much?"
523231, "I want to stop the plague. I want to use your panacea to save the infected. And that means we need a lot of panacea, wouldn't you agree?"
523232, "I see."
523233, "A legend? How real is this one? Who can tell me more?"
523234, "I don't think so. They're waiting for the sacrifice."
523235, "So how do I get to this blood without sacrificing anyone? ...Or anything? What do they want from me?!"
523236, "Don't worry. The hour is nigh. Soon I will kill who they want me to kill."
523237, "A stupid idea."
523238, "Never mind. It's just a curious interpretation. The Polyhedron is like a whole town in and of itself. And children do think it's alive..."
523239, "Alive? And how on earth does it deserve that title?"
523240, "The Bachelor has recently become the expert on the matter... Basically, it speaks to them somehow. Reads their minds and grants them dreams. It's a machine, really, but children think it's a living machine. And they also say that it can bleed..."
523241, "What?!"
523242, "Stop licking my boots."
523243, "Do you remember the tale of an Orphan? A butterfly pupa helped him, and he helped her in return..."
523244, "So this is your plan..."
523245, "I don't know this tale."
523246, "Well there are loads of tales like that, believe me. One in three Steppe tales is about an Orphan. A robust tradition, as you can see... an Orphan is a blessed figure. You are following in well-established footsteps."
523247, "Perhaps."
523248, "That was a gesture of respect. I'm surprised you don't know. Don't you know only an orphan can take in the Earth's knowledge and thus succeed the authority over the Kin? Everyone will bow down to you."
523249, "I don't need that."
523250, "Call me another name."
523251, "The Foreman will offer you the final trial today. He'll promise to reveal everything if you pass it. He'll tell all about the sacrifice you're required to make, and you will only have to kill it. See? And then they'll give you the blood. But it's all lies."
523252, "You're on your way to see the Foreman now, aren't you?"
523253, "Well, yeah."
523254, "Why?"
523255, "How do you know?"
523256, "The Foreman's trial will be designed so that you wouldn't stand a chance. He'll tell you to descend into the Depths or go through the throat-or something. And to get back from there. And that's where you'll die because there's no coming back from that place. But I know how to outsmart him."
523257, "How?"
523258, "Don't ask, I won't tell you. It's not my choice."
523259, "What do you want for it?"
523260, "Perhaps I'll ask a favour of you tomorrow morning. Deal?"
523261, "Deal."
523262, "No. I find your offer suspicious."
523263, "All right. I agree."
523264, "Then do as he says and fear nothing."
523265, "What should I fear?"
523266, "I will catch you so that you don't fall to your death. I will open the door for you so that you come back from where few do."
523267, "I trust you."
523268, "I have nothing to lose anyway."
523269, "Well, I'm not an entirely common person. I have a way of knowing. Trust me."
523270, "So what can you offer me?"
523271, "Why would you help me?"
523272, "I help everyone. I bring the dead back to life. This is why I came to this world; this is what I've been doing my whole time here. Healing and reviving. There's nothing for me to gain from it."
523273, "Toot your own horn... right?"
523274, "So do you agree?"
523275, "I've heard different."
523276, "I do."
523277, "No. I don't want your help."
523278, "Are they souls?"
523279, "Where did these... women come from?"
523280, "These are not women. These are their tekhe."
523281, "Their what?"
523282, "These are tekhe. A tekhe is the clot between the warm and the cold. It's like a soul, only smaller and able to talk. It escapes the sick and the sleeping, hanging between the warm earth and the cold sky so that the spirits could whisper in its ear demanding to hear the story of the person's life."
523284, "Wait a minute. And then what?"
523285, "She will stay here instead of you."
523286, "Where are we?"
523287, "I don't know, but I think this is what the dead tell Grace about. This is a Kaiur-the passage that connects two worlds. When people die, they usually fly through it in an instant without noticing."
523288, "Why are they here?"
523289, "I made them stay here for a while."
523290, "What a dirty trick! Someone else will have to die in my stead?"
523291, "Okay."
523292, "How did that happen?"
523293, "No need for sorrow, they are all dead anyway. Don't waste your words in vain. Save your breath."
523294, "Fine. I will remember this!"
523295, "No, it will not do. I'm staying here."
523296, "Then everybody dies. The town will be destroyed, and Plague will devour the Earth. You won't fulfil you destiny. Your father will remain unavenged."
523297, "Let it be so."
523298, "No. It's your return fee."
523299, "What happens to them?"
523300, "How do I get out of here?"
523301, "Okay. I'm going."
523302, "When you have chosen a soul, ask her what you want to know. She will tell you the truth. Use the opportunity. Then walk through the black opening. It will let you through."
523303, "I will."
523304, "Okay."
523305, "And who is... beyond the wall?"
523306, "I don't know. I can only feel them. They are obscure. They are the ones in charge of everything here. They're big but narrow-souled, trying to hide their wretchedness from us. It was all their doing. They haven't revealed themselves yet."
523307, "Will they?"
523308, "Their time hasn't come yet. They are waiting in the wings. They will probably break into the world when it ends. Tomorrow they will show themselves... As for now, it is better not to disturb them. Just go along the tunnel."
523309, "Are they gods?"
523310, "No, they are something different. The masked demons are their minions and envoys. Don't talk to them! Just walk along the tunnel."
523311, "What's going to happen to me?"
523312, "What's going to happen to me?"
523313, "Who are these women?"
523314, "Who are these women?"
523315, "I see."
523316, "But these ones-are they alive?"
523317, "I'm scared....."
523318, "I'd like to..."
523319, "Don't talk! Or do you want her to die in vain? Move, you won't have a second chance! Be quiet and clench your teeth."
523320, "..."
523321, "Are you telling the truth?"
523322, "Who killed my father, Isidor Burakh?"
523323, "Who is the sacrifice the Kin is expecting from me?"
523324, "So, you must be Artemy Burakh?"
523325, "Yes. Answer the question."
523326, "...That's unclear. I see the line breaking into two here. They are parallel though. Like a circle turned inside out. I can't look at it anymore. I'll lose my mind."
523327, "You didn't answer my question. Who is the person I am meant to sacrifice?"
523328, "I want to ask you a question."
523329, "Go ahead. Just be quick. It's hard for me to stay here for so long."
523330, "There was no person."
523331, "Damn... I still don't understand."
523332, "Am I dead? I don't think so... The host is merely asleep."
523334, "...Anna has been slandered. They think she was a kidnapper, a leech, a Caravan murderer. The host was too proud to offer excuses. Now that she's ill, no one will be there to help her. Her death will bring joy to many."
523335, "Are you telling the truth?"
523336, "I cannot lie."
523337, "How will you die?"
523338, "I believe you."
523339, "..."
523340, "It will have something to do with the girl that came to the town a few days ago. She'll have a hand in the death of the host."
523341, "Are you telling the truth?"
523342, "I'm not dead yet."
523343, "Talk some more, sweet soul. Look, some nails are already in."
523344, "Are you drawing my last breath from me?"
523345, "No way in hell!"
523346, "Indeed, sweet soul. It's leaving you with every word you mutter. Look at the nails-there's only one left. Make your final step."
523347, "I won't."
523348, "Go devour someone else."
523350, "I want to ask you a question."
523351, "Ask me anything you want, just make it brief."
523352, "Who is the sacrifice that the Kin is expecting from me?"
523353, "Foreman Oyun has fallen out of favour with the Kin. When they learned that Suok rejected Oyun's offering of aurochs they were infuriated. The Foreman failed to read the lines of the Great Bull appropriately. Were it not for the plague, he'd have been killed already. The Kin, then, will accept any offering you make as long as you put an end to the order that precluded your arrival. "
523354, "You did not answer my question. Who is the sacrifice?"
523355, "Who says the offering is necessarily a 'who'? All you need to do is to stop looking for it. Having done that you will have fulfilled your destiny before you know it."
523356, "I want to understand what I'm doing."
523357, "That's quite enough. Tell me now, what I myself shall do? Is it safe to go back?"
523359, "I'll tell you later."
523360, "Who killed my father, Isidor Burakh?"
523361, "You are Burakh's son?"
523362, "Yes. Answer me."
523363, "Foreman Oyun is the one who killed your father."
523364, "He will pay for that!"
523365, "Are you telling the truth?"
523366, "I cannot lie."
523367, "I believe you."
523368, "..."
523369, "How did you die?"
523370, "I didn't die yet. My body has entered a kind of lethargic stasis."
523371, "How will you die?"
523372, "It all has to do with the girl who came to town a few days ago. She will play a decisive role in how the host dies."
523373, "Are you telling the truth?"
523374, "Is that so? I have commited suicide, perhaps. The changeling girl has obliged me by exposing the crushing vacuity of my existence."
523375, "Are you telling the truth?"
523383, "I'm sorry."
523415, "Well, let's see what's infected and what's boarded off."
523416, "All right... We need money, as usual. A donation to the Scout Care Fund. A thousand and a half-that's a bargain!"
523417, "Did they kill one of yours?"
523418, "Not just someone. They killed Riddle."
523419, "It's all tied up, wish someone would untie it... You're free to take your business elsewhere if you're not interested. I'll find another client."
523420, "All right. Have it your way."
523421, "Whatever."
523423, "Will you answer a question for me?"
523424, "I will. Go ahead."
523425, "Who is the sacrifice that the Kin is expecting from me?"
523426, "I don't know! This future turns inside out when I turn towards it. I'm losing my mind. But there's definitely a false bottom to it! Be careful."
523427, "You didn't answer my question. Who is the person I am meant to sacrifice?"
523428, "It's a trap. I shouldn't tell you. Don't ask me about the sacrifice. Just follow your heart."
523429, "Fine."
523430, "Should I follow the clanking of the beaks?"
523434, "No, wait for now."
523435, "Who killed my father, Isidor Burakh?"
523438, "Foreman Oyun. He did it on Big Vlad's orders."
523439, "I knew it!"
523440, "Are you telling the truth?"
523441, "I cannot lie."
523442, "I believe you."
523443, "I need time to process this."
523444, "How did you die?"
523445, "I'm not dead yet. My body is asleep."
523446, "How will you die?"
523447, "I will be executed-executed by a firing squad for an attempt on the life of Alexander Block, the commander."
523448, "Are you telling the truth?"
523449, "I got sick when I went outside."
523450, "Are you telling the truth?"
523455, "I'm going."
523456, "Sleep well."
523457, "Is this a parable or something? Why?"
523458, "Clara has shown me that the disgrace that befell our family was but a terrible mistake by the military. I've always though so... and now I know for sure. It's all Block's fault. He'd been the commanding officer then already."
523459, "Why did you?"
523460, "...Clara convinced me that it had to be done. It's not her fault though. Don't scold her when you get back."
523461, "A disgrace? What was it about?"
523462, "That I will not tell. And I'm getting weaker. Don't ask anything else. I'm short of breath..."
523463, "Who?"
523464, "Foreman Oyun."
523465, "The Foreman said it was a bull."
523466, "Perhaps he said it was a 'bull's horn'? You must have thought he was just being poetic... but he simply was unable to tell a lie. And yet he didn't say it was him... He weaseled himself out."
523467, "I want to know why you ordered my father killed... you shit!"
523468, "Was the Foreman acting on your orders?"
523469, "Oh... I knew that's what you would be told. It is... somewhat reasonable. I wanted him to die. But I never had him... killed. They didn't really need me to... I've arranged the whole thing so that the oynons of the Kin would settle it themselves... I gave no orders. It happened on its own."
523470, "Explain yourself."
523471, "The plan was direct and simple. He went off to the Steppe back then, you know... My daughter told me he'd come back with a demon piggybacking him. Then she pondered about it for a while and came to the conclusion it was a nightmare rather than a prophetic dream. So I went to Katerina... to ask her if Isidor would come back."
523472, "Go on."
523473, "Pray believe me... Only in the areas that had to do with the works. He maintained... cast-iron discipline. The Kin was timid under his ledership. They're like a single being, as you probably know... Well, under Oyun this being was dormant. Obedient, sluggish, and dull. But they did work... they worked well."
523474, "How did he control them?"
523475, "Just like every Foreman ever has... from generation to generation. They worshipped the traditions; they looked for bulls in the Steppe according to the Rite. Brought them to the Abattoir, invited them in, begged them to come... all along the lines of the rite. Then they killed the bulls and cut them open... Every Foreman ever. It's been like this for hundreds of years."
523476, "Was he a man of noticeable influence?"
523477, "I don't know. I didn't really care, to be honest. Why would I-as long as meat was plenty? My son, on the other hand... he was interested... too much, really... It went against his best interests... the poor boy."
523478, "Katerina... It was frightening. She foretold everything that has happened here during the last few days. She knew that Isidor was to become Simon's demise... and that Simon's death would lead to thousands more. I concluded there was going to be a riot... that he'd come back and incite an uprising among the Kin... He was planning on changing many things, you know... Who would consider a plague back then?"
523479, "I am going to kill you, Olgimsky. How would you prefer to die?"
523480, "...Are you sure about it?"
523481, "I am."
523482, "Why are you surprised?"
523483, "Fine. Then please do me one last favour. Let me do it myself. It will be over in three hours, I promise."
523484, "I will come to the Lump in three hours. If you're still alive by then, I will help you die. It will take me way less time."
523485, "Your spirit is still strong and unwavering. That is good. Fine. I will leave this matter to you. If your conscience lets you live, then live."
523487, "Let it be as you will... Foreman Burakh."
523488, "Everything will be as I will from now on."
523489, "Yes. Let it be so."
523490, "Did he know about your plans?"
523491, "You old deceitful fox!"
523492, "No. My children are not privy to the matters of management."
523493, "Fine."
523494, "What was he planning to change?"
523495, "...He had forebodings. He was muddying the waters. He claimed I was strangling the Kin... That I was killing them and that Oyun was helping me with his illicit rule. He declared that we had forgotten the law. Too many bulls were killed back then... the machines had to be establushed and tuned. The factory needed to get going... and their rites were only getting in my way... Well, Oyun was quite accomodating..."
523496, "Why didn't Foreman Oyun rebel against your rule?"
523497, "Oyun... who would allow him to be in power if not I? And even that happened by accident... Isidor has achieved his very own Great Schema... he was only interested in healing and disregarded the wordly politics. He taught the young and was learning... for many years. So what? It's all his own fault, if you ask me... he didn't want to get his hands dirty in the Abattoir, and he paid for it."
523498, "And so, when my father tried to change things, you got rid of him?"
523499, "So you ordered to have him killed when there was unrest in the Kin?"
523500, "Oyun kind of... hinted that getting him to, ahem, resign wouldn't be that bad an idea. He never explained in detail how exactly this resignment would work, but there was really no need to. What other way could there be to make a Burakh resign? By that moment I have already realized what Oyun had in mind. But I never argued with him... see? I'm not trying to hide it, pray forgive me. Truth be told... it was plain to me what he was doing."
523501, "What else did she say about my father?"
523502, "She said that Burakh will become the leader of the Kin, bringing my reign to an end. So I asked her about my son... but she said neither father nor son are to keep the power-only Burakh. Well, now I realize which Burakh she was talking about... She must have been just as clueless as to the meaning of her prophecy as I was back then... I thought it was about Isidor..."
523503, "Why on earth?"
523504, "Could you have stopped Oyun?"
523505, "I could have... Yes, I could have."
523506, "I'll think of what to do with you."
523507, "You deserve to die."
523508, "Why did you tell me about the Foreman this morning?"
523509, "I wanted you to know..."
523510, "You liar! You wanted me to jump on his knife. Didn't you?"
523511, "Well, thanks for that anyway."
523512, "There's no reason to deny it now... Pray have mercy... I did. You see right through me, Burakh."
523513, "You swine."
523514, "Aren't you afraid of me?"
523515, "Afraid? I would be... if everything hadn't come to this. But now it doesn't matter. I fear nothing."
523516, "But you should."
523517, "I had no doubt about that."
523518, "How do you know?"
523519, "I have known it for a while now."
523520, "I am at fault for not telling you straight away... It wasn't possible."
523521, "That is low."
523522, "I had no choice."
523523, "How is it different now?"
523524, "Now... well, now Foreman Oyun has gotten square with me... in full."
523525, "So it's the Foreman?"
523526, "Why didn't you tell me?"
523527, "The name. Now."
523528, "No matter. He won't weasel anyone out next time."
523529, "I'm listening."
523530, "Your udurgh is Simon. Or rather not exactly Simon; a structure, an architectural complex-so, you see, the 'town' aspect of the sigil is preserved, it's actually even emphasized. Now imagine this structure taking in Simon's soul... to become alive."
523531, "How can it be? I don't understand."
523532, "I know, it's almost beyond comprehension. A phenomenon that can have both a scientific and a mystical interpretation... I can't explain or prove it here and now-Aglaya's got the blueprints. But it's true, trust me! A structure absorbs a soul and comes to life!"
523533, "Absorbs a soul? How exactly?"
523534, "Well, it hasn't happened yet. But the Kains guarantee they can do it. It's an interdisciplinary effort that has to do with both optics and human psyche. And a certain breakthrough."
523535, "But who is my sacrifice then?"
523536, "I don't know. I think it's all superstition anyway."
523537, "How do you know all these things about the Polyhedron, oynon?"
523538, "I've investigated everything thoroughly. I had a suspicion that the Polyhedron had been the cause of the outbreak."
523539, "And what have you found out?"
523540, "Well. I've found out that there'd be nothing to be done even if it was true."
523541, "How could that happen, oynon?"
523542, "Talk to the Foreman. He'll tell you how it was built."
523543, "I will."
523544, "It's too late to talk to him now."
523545, "Without a sacrifice they won't give me the blood that the serum requires. I must choose the right one."
523546, "Why don't you ask openly? Let the Foreman tell you what he wants from you."
523547, "He wants me to guess."
523548, "Well, intimidate him then. I haven't seen the Foreman, I don't know what type of person he is. But I think that a solid threat can convince anybody. Intimidate him!"
523549, "How?"
523551, "Kain gave me a hint today-seems like the Foreman had something to do with your father's demise. Big Vlad is also in on it. Didn't he tell you?"
523553, "Yes... I already know."
523554, "The blueprints?"
523555, "It doesn't matter! Aglaya can explain the details to you... but it may be ill-advised to ask her, I feel. She'll misrepresent them. Somehow it feels to me that my findings are not to her liking. She was expecting something else. But it's the truth! And the truth will out. Everything clicks."
523556, "What makes you think it's alive?"
523557, "Listen... You could say it's just the Kains' family superstition, but it's obvious that a structure can serve as a soul vessel. Or rather a memory vessel. They call it memory."
523558, "You mean the Tower contains Simon's soul?"
523559, "So a structure becomes a vessel for a soul-like a body?"
523560, "Precisely. Personally I am overwhelmed and humbled... I could never have imagined something like this could be possible. A chimera made of the living and the non-living. I am absolutely positive, Artemy, that this is your udurgh. Are you aware that Simon was one of Isidor's last patients?"
523561, "I am. Perhaps you're right, oynon."
523562, "I'll consider this."
523566, "So you're fine with having your father held responsible for your crime?"
523567, "I don't want to talk about it. Enough."
523568, "How are you going to live with it?"
523569, "Tell me, Vlad, who killed my father?"
523570, "Someone from the Kin, I think. I don't know who in particular."
523571, "You liar. Speak, or else..."
523572, "Sorry for having bothered you."
523573, "Do you know something?"
523574, "I'm the one asking questions now."
523575, "Okay. Your father was killed by Foreman Oyun."
523576, "I hope it doesn't come to your father having died in vain..."
523577, "What do you mean?"
523578, "He gave his life for you-but you're a breath away from dying now..."
523580, "I have nothing more to say."
523582, "Are you still trying to protect your father?"
523583, "Okay. I believe you."
523584, "My father had nothing to do with Isidor's death. Word of honour. You know he has nothing to lose now. He would have confessed, had he been involved with this... incident. Oyun did it all by himself. Isidor wanted to take his place, but Oyun is a beast. It didn't take him too long to decide."
523585, "You'll regret this if I find out you've lied again."
523586, "Okay, as you say."
523587, "What choice do I have?"
523588, "Why are you asking me?"
523589, "I'm not an idiot. I can see where this is all going. The survivors, however scarce, will brand you their savior. The Kin will worshp your sacrifice, the townsfolk will remember the panacea. If you make wise choices when dealing with the Inquisitor and the Commander, they will eliminate each other."
523590, "I can't see how that would gain me something..."
523591, "You are not being entirely honest. They will eliminate each other, and you will gain power. Just choose someone to represent a family that would support you. You will rule the Kin... and that requires a good name and charm."
523592, "And you volunteer yourself as the supporter, of course."
523593, "...Me? No. I volunteer my sister. Capella is going to awaken soon. She will become a Mistress, just like my mother, only even lovelier. Mistresses are obeyed unquestionably. I only hope the Kains don't stifle her progress... but I'll take care of that."
523594, "I don't care for this plotting."
523595, "You can take poison. Or maybe jump from the Tower."
523596, "I'll think about it."
523597, "You can handle it without me."
523598, "What about my father? How did he make the sacrifice?"
523599, "Don't you know?"
523600, "Why?"
523602, "I did what I did. Are you going to avenge him?"
523603, "So you lied to me when you said that he was killed by a bull?"
523604, "I told you that he was killed by a Bos's horn. That was the weapon in my hands. I was acting by the rite. Your father broke the lines of the Kin."
523605, "You lie!"
523606, "Speak."
523607, "He wanted to restore the old order. He wanted to transplant old parts into a new body. Pour old blood into new veins. He broke the lines of the Kin. He died."
523608, "Yes, I am. Here and now."
523609, "No."
523610, "Raise your hands and prepare to die."
523611, "And you dared to challenge a Burakh..."
523612, "I am alive. You are to call me Elder One now."
523613, "I am no spirit. I am a man."
523614, "You went into the Throat. You followed the path of water. You couldn't have come back! Or are you a sorcerer that dared to break the Lines of the House of Suok with his black magics?"
523615, "So you have lead me to my certain death, haven't you?"
523616, "Now I know who have killed my father. And you know what that means."
523617, "I have. But I will restore the lines of Suok's Womb. Take one step back if you're no spirit."
523618, "I am no longer where you'd sent me. See for yourself!"
523619, "No! Don't kill me..."
523620, "That is wise. You will learn who the sacrifice is then. We shall speak as equals, Burakh."
523621, "What sacrifice am I to make? Speak!"
523622, "It had been told that the sacrifice is Aglaya Lilich, a woman who wanted to merge her lines with yours. Butchers would have opened the blood for you if you had killed her-if I had allowed it, of course, or if you had killed me. But it was I that killed you in the end."
523623, "I don't need you to allow me anything."
523624, "You are mistaken."
523625, "Why can we only speak as equals after the trial?"
523626, "Everyone goes through the trial... So did your father. It is only then that you will see how far the Vein of Boddho goes. You will walk along it and circle back, tying life and death together just as a vein is tied into a knot. A vein wastes precious blood in vain when untied."
523627, "How do I do that?"
523628, "Go out of here and to the right. Step into the next cave. It is the Hollow of Her Primal Womb. You will see a well-this is where Her navel is untied for those who have the knowledge. Then you will fall down. Lay your body down there and come towards Suok's navel. Go to the heart of Her lines. Then come back here. And then we will talk."
523629, "Tell me what to do."
523630, "I feel there is a catch. I'll come back to you later."
523631, "That simple?"
523632, "You will see."
523633, "Okay."
523634, "When did my father pass the trial?"
523635, "Later than he should have... You ask too many questions. Are you going?"
523636, "I am."
523637, "What do I do?"
523638, "Go into that cave. It is the Hollow of Her Primal Womb. You will see a well-this is where Her navel is untied for those who have the knowledge. Then you will fall down. Lay your body down there and come towards Suok's navel. Go to the heart of Her lines. Then come back here. And then we will talk."
523639, "I am ready."
523640, "That simple?"
523641, "You will see."
523642, "Okay."
523644, "You really don't have to."
523645, "Advise me, Kindred One."
523646, "You know everything. We're waiting for you to make a sacrifice, oynon. Make it by the rite. Cut its lines open. Then rule over us. All of Bos Turokh's blood will flow through you, for you are the heart of the Kin. Be worthy of that name."
523647, "I have to make my sacrifice."
523648, "I know about the sacrifice. Is that all?"
523649, "I have to pass his trial and survive."
523650, "Are you going to fight him?"
523651, "Why did you put so much pressure on me then?"
523652, "Foreman Oyun killed your father. Did you know this?"
523653, "...It is decided then. I will become the end of him."
523654, "The Foreman is nigh unkillable-even by you. He's older and stronger. I think all is lost now. If chance doesn't help you until tomorrow, step down. The Burakhs have lost their claim."
523655, "I wouldn't have asked you if I knew, Kindred One."
523656, "He was very clever. He didn't kill a person, even though that's what was expected. He took a sickle and cut down a field of nine-year-old swevery with it. I don't think he really expected that blood would flow from the stems-but it did. That's how the marsh was formed; the Gullet was full of blood for two days straight. Then Bos Turokh accepted him."
523657, "Don't you know that already?"
523658, "Yes, that is all."
523659, "I don't think so. Why would I?"
523660, "Foreman Oyun is lying to you. The Kin will never follow your lead while he's alive. No one cares about the challenger, even a challenger of a superior bloodline, while the old priest is still there. There's no point in you making the sacrifice. Not while he's still alive."
523661, "But I don't want to kill him..."
523663, "Good. Everybody kills. But there's something else you should know."
523664, "What?"
523665, "What about my father? Did he kill too?"
523666, "Yes, I think this is where it's all going."
523667, "He did. He made a sacrifice and shed rivers of blood."
523668, "Is that all I'm supposed to do?"
523669, "Really? It takes a load off my mind then..."
523670, "I was hoping that he'd go down by chance. That the soldiers would bust into the Abattoir, that the Worms, terrified by the plague, would become irrational... it happens. You've been having a very good fortune, things were working out very well for you. But now he's triumphant. Nothing can bring him down now, not even the plague."
523671, "So I will kill him."
523675, "The Kin will renounce him if we tell them!"
523676, "You are mistaken. Gasp in horror-yes. They will also respect him even more. We are beasts. Beasts follow the strongest. The leader. The victor."
523677, "So what should I do?"
523678, "I'll follow your advice."
523679, "Where does the power of the Copious taglurs come from?"
523681, "How can the Foreman rule without troops? Why does the Kin yield to him? How do the leaders of the ruling families accept it?"
523682, "It's the power of standing. Each party has their own domain. The power of the Taglurs arose naturally to fill the corners of reality that the rulers would never understand; you people only offered the rulers the leftovers of that power. The Olgimskys haven't been holding the Kin in their grasp for all that long, you know. The odonghs are stronger."
523683, "Why the unrest in the Termitary then?"
523684, "It's not always smooth... Sometimes Foremen would get too old, sometimes the Kin would rise in response to Suok's fever. Sometimes they couldn't find a common tongue with the commandants of the Termitary. Sometimes Mistresses would turn their gaze towards the Kin-but generally the Kin is compliant."
523685, "So, the Burakhs' standing is still high, isn't it?"
523686, "Explain yourself."
523687, "I've fallen in love with you, oynon. I care too much; I so desperately want you to live. You were brought up away from here, you've forgotten our rites and customs. You were in need of a friend here, a mentor. It was easier for me to keep your belongings for the time being-easier than trying to explain why they are dangerous to keep... and even more dangerous to use."
523688, "What are you talking about?"
523689, "It's a bone, a Bos Primigenius's horn. Here, it confirms that you are the eldest of the Burakhs, that you know the rite and preserve the art of a Copious taglur."
523690, "What was it that you preferred not to share with me?"
523691, "A copious taglur?"
523692, "The Burakhs are a Copious taglur. You know the lines, you know how to cut a body open. The rite is your right. There are but a few families of the kind left. I had no right to make this choice for you..."
523693, "Give me the bone."
523694, "It is rightfully yours. Take it and forgive me... I swear that I meant well. Had I not abused the situation, you'd have been dead by now. You will now be once again accused of patricide by many... the week-old story will repeat itself. Be prepared."
523695, "Fallen in love?"
523696, "Like a slave falls in love with their master; like a thing falls in love with its owner-it is dog's affection. I know it's forbidden for an odongh to couple with a woman from the Kin. I am simply devoted to you, oynon."
523697, "I see. So what was it that you preferred to postpone sharing with me?"
523698, "So, it wasn't you the local... crones were talking about."
523699, "Absolutely."
523700, "Go on then."
523701, "What about Oyun?"
523702, "He is too. He's weaker, much weaker than the alternatives-that's why he's handy for the Olgimsky leeches. They're all wolves of a pack, conspirators intent on weakening the Kin! Were it not for the leeches, the Kin would have long risen against Oyun!"
523703, "They know the lines, duh! It's clear as day, isn't it? They know how to open up and turn around the cryptic lines of a body, a word, the sky, the earth, and even water. That's how it used to be anyway."
523704, "That's not what I'm talking about. How come the power this knowledge grants to its bearer is so great?"
523705, "Why is that a surprise?"
523706, "I get it, thank you."
523707, "Correct. You've passed the test."
523708, "You are one smart lady..."
523709, "Why?"
523710, "Because he doesn't know the lines, that's why! How is he an odongh at all? Fetching water for your father-that's his place, and nothing more. His hands are strong, he knows the rite, but his will is weak. The art escapes him. When your father resigned, the age of Knowledge was replaced with the age of Burden and brute force."
523711, "I see."
523712, "I've heard that before."
523713, "The power of the Copious taglurs is great. Never forget that, oynon. The ruling families get diplomacy, polyhedrons, politics, and intrigue. We get the earth, the primal power, the cycles, and the bulky movement of life. The eternal battle for the harvest. The annual birth. The heat and the meat."
523714, "I'll keep that in mind."
523715, "Why did you hide it from me?"
523716, "...Intuition. Also... I have a strong feeling that this is the exact horn that had pierced your father's chest. I managed to snatch it from under the nose of Saburov's crazed henchmen while they were inspecting the crime scene. Had I given it to you, you would have been walking around the place with the murder weapon in your pocket."
523717, "Tell me about the other families."
523718, "You did wrong."
523719, "What you did was right."
523720, "Few families still hold the right to carry out the rite in this part of the Steppe-the Mangyzes, the Beshetches, the Burakhs, the Oyuns, and the Kryuks. The last of the Magyzes died... he was basically killed by Black Nina. The Beshetches used to know the lines almost as well as the Mangyzes, but they've been brought to naught by twyrine..."
523721, "It'll be different now. I will take care of it all-on my own."
523722, "Were they the best?"
523723, "Yes. Well, each family had its own line of work-and each was rather brilliant when handling their line. The Burakhs, for example, have always been talented healers. The Mangyzes were the most ruthless and decisive, the Beshetches were the greatest in number. The Oyuns and the Kryuks have never been taken seriously... they are apprentices, not masters."
523724, "Give me the bone."
523725, "Yet you will not get an answer. Why should I share this knowledge with you? You cannot take it, and it will rip you apart."
523726, "I am the son of Isidor Burakh. It's not an Oyun's place to talk to me about knowledge."
523727, "I see before me someone who calls himself a son of Burakh. You haven't accepted his inheritance and are therefore unworthy of his name."
523728, "Lie! I've accepted my father's inheritance in full."
523729, "Have you accepted your father's duty and the obligation to save the lives that he gave an oath to keep?"
523730, "I have."
523731, "Have you accepted his knowledge? Have you accepted his lines? Have you learned how to tell the dark from the light, the damp from the crumbling, the scorching from the cold, the dead from the living?"
523732, "I have."
523733, "Have you accepted his possessions? His house, his flesh, his food, and his signs?"
523734, "I have."
523735, "I haven't."
523736, "Then there is nothing to talk about. You are not your father's son until his lines are continued through you. Leave."
523737, "I haven't."
523738, "I'll be back."
523739, "I haven't."
523740, "Accepting it is my personal business."
523741, "Then show me the thing that he used to draw the lines on the ground with when opening them up for a ritual. Where is his udey, which should be hanging around your neck proudly so that everyone can see who is in charge of the lines of the Burakhs' taglur?"
523742, "I don't know what you're talking about."
523743, "I will fix that."
523744, "I will only speak to you when you have your father's udey hanging from your neck. Seems like something has been concealed from you by the one that passed the inheritance to you."
523745, "But the rite didn't go the way you wanted it to. You couldn't get living blood from the beast killed the day before yesterday."
523746, "That is so, but I can draw it from the earth. It is the blood that feeds Suok's body, the blood that flows through her veins underground, the blood that we have been pouring there since time immemorial, feeding Bos Turokh's body to be fed by him in return."
523747, "So you've taken this blood from below the ground? How old is it?"
523748, "Warmed by Suok's body, brought to life by Suok's breath, the currents of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of bulls cut open lie undergound. Its age should be of no concern to you. It has been the living blood of Suok from the moment it was poured into Bos Turokh's veins."
523749, "Where exactly is the entrance point that the blood gets poured into?"
523750, "I will tell you of this too. Here, in the Abattoir, at the heart of the house of Suok, lies a well that is connected to the veins feeding the earth."
523751, "Can blood be extracted from there?"
523752, "Only by an odongh, the Foreman of the Abattoir, who belongs to a Long taglur and knows the rite. The blood rises from down below heeding his call. But I will not call this blood for you until we are equal."
523753, "Why not?"
523754, "Because I do not want you to have it. You are unworthy of thinking about it, let alone taking it. It was not you, but boös Vlad that I gave the blood to before-to help him and on his orders."
523755, "So how can I get this blood?"
523756, "By making the sacrifice and fulfilling your father's duty. By passing every trial, completing every task and proving that you are worthy of making such a sacrifice. Not before that. Come tomorrow, we shall talk about it."
523758, "I have, I'll show you. A funny coincidence... She was looking for you too-and looked serious about it! I literally cowered when I saw her. This Clara's up to something. Chances are she'll outsmart us all."
523759, "So where is she?"
523760, "At Murky's van."
523761, "What business would she have with her?"
523762, "Oh, it's all been going so fast with Clara lately... It's all secrets-all of them sinister. She's creepy. Hanging around, asking things, showing her teeth... And there's never an answer if you ask her anything. Yep, she does give me the creeps."
523763, "And I know you're no coward..."
523764, "My point exactly, be careful with her... She's up to something! I don't like it. She might as well make the both of us links in her chain... I feel she already has. We won't just be fooled, we'll end up being the bad guys."
523765, "We'll deal with it."
523766, "You too, Notkin? You schemers..."
523767, "What did she want?"
523768, "What makes you think she's trying something smart?"
523769, "No bloody idea. She has an agenda. Looked triumphant, too. As though you've given her a jackpot."
523770, "Where is she now?"
523785, "What's so costly about it?"
523786, "Immunity boosters for the scouts. I'm tired of explaining it over and over."
523787, "What kind of a payment is that?"
523788, "It's all in the interests of the scouts who make the map, Burakh. They're being threatened. They get killed by precisely those people, the marauders. Get it?"
523789, "I don't understand. Why is the well filled up?"
523790, "It's a rather sorry story. A gang of marauders tried to escape a blocked-off district with their loot and ran into unexpected and courageous resistance. Patrolmen were there too... but that's not the point."
523791, "Yeah, it doesn't make sense yet."
523792, "The bandits were not of the timid sort themselves. They pulled out guns and began shooting, trying to mount a retreat. After killing two of their pursuers, running along roofs and backyards, they somehow got to this area. Then one of them remembered this well of mine..."
523793, "Perhaps there was a worker of yours among them."
523794, "You're a quick thinker... precisely. The clumsy townsfolk lagged behind, taking the long route, so the marauders had the time to break into here, throw the loot in, and even go down the well themselves. The pursuit was on my step already, you know..."
523795, "What happened next?"
523797, "Climbing roofs and waterpipes requires certain skills! It's not like anyone can do it..."
523798, "I've found the bastards too. I barely escaped with a whole skin."
523799, "I thought we had an agreement that I keep everything else."
523800, "I promised to reward the risk you took. I keep my word."
523801, "Oh, surely. Especially since I've gotten that which is most valuable to me back."
523802, "So we're even?"
523803, "That is unnecessary. It doesn't feel right accept your money."
523804, "I can't-no matter how I try."
523805, "Yeah... These bastards are pissing everyone off!"
523806, "When the townsfolk broke in, they saw the last of the bandits descending into the well. They tried to continuie the pursuit, but the bandits started shooting and killed one more. I'm pretty sure they were sitting there, waiting for their targets-to-be to follow them one by one. And then one of the pursuers got this clever idea..."
523807, "To fill up the well."
523808, "Exactly. WIthout a moment's hesitation these honest people decided to bury the marauders alive. As you can see, they succeeded. It's not the loss of the well that troubles me though-I've had plenty of opportunities to make sure it's barren. There was a great loss, however..."
523809, "As in?"
523810, "How do you know that?"
523811, "The pursuers told me about it. They should have left the marauders in peace!"
523812, "Why?"
523813, "Did they push them down the well or something?"
523814, "Indeed! If I'm not mistaken, there is a secret passage by the Theatre that leads underground. Anything that you find on the robbers is yours. Moreover, I will reward you very generously! These notes are priceless for me. Like the fifty two recipes of twyrine... or the description of the Rite of Heads..."
523815, "So, you want me to go down there and fetch them?"
523816, "Try to focus on the good things."
523817, "What do you mean 'not real'... It's about mommy and daddy!"
523818, "You shouldn't think about it like that."
523819, "No, no! What if in the end I'll find out how to see them? What if they come back?"
523820, "Oh Clara..."
523821, "I'll stop by tomorrow, we'll think of something."
523822, "It's about an orphan and the underground dwellers. About gehken-the falselegs who undermine houses... And about the water from Sugagh Khadugh."
523823, "What's so scary about it?"
523824, "A lot of it is. I asked Clara if she could speak to my parents and ask them how I can protect myself from getting infected. And she said she'll tell me a fairytale and they'll come to life and I'll be able to speak to them myself... And she began talking."
523825, "Come to life? How's that?"
523826, "I don't know... You can't tell by the fairytale because she hasn't finished it. Ooh, it's gnawing at me!"
523827, "Speak to them yourself? So, is she planning to animate the dead?"
523828, "Why?"
523829, "Because she called mommy and daddy. That's how it was in the tale. What if they come and I miss them? I don't know where they are supposed to arrive to. You only find out about the location in the ending!"
523830, "Don't waste your time."
523832, "Storytelling? Some people do..."
523833, "What are gehken?"
523834, "The falselegs... They're these ugly little men, like worms... They don't love anyone. The orphan wanted to talk to his parents... And for that he had to make the falselegs love him... And they are so horrible! Nasty, nasty! I hate them..."
523835, "Don't cry. Come on! Are you a baby? Or are they really dangerous?"
523836, "That's nothing."
523837, "Let's talk about the Termitary."
523838, "Do you really want to go that way? What have you been told?"
523839, "I've been told that it's your fault."
523840, "It's not my place to talk about it. Leave it be! It's a family matter."
523841, "The wretched Worms you've been starving in the Termitary may well soon become my kin."
523842, "What was that supposed to mean? Are you talking about your... priesthood? Your father's legacy, your Foreman ambitions? The revenge of the Burakhs?"
523843, "Perhaps."
523844, "So we'll talk when that happens. The Olgimskys-whoever of us is the eldest and in charge-will report the state of the Termitary to the Kin then. As for now, topic closed."
523845, "It won't take long."
523846, "...Yes. You're slick!"
523847, "Slick? Why?"
523848, "You know who's to blame!"
523849, "Do you know for sure who the culprit is?"
523850, "Hmmm... I don't-not for sure, anyway. But I think it's Fat Vlad."
523851, "Mother, what kind of punishment is in store for that person?"
523852, "The terrible kind. I'll let Worms and butchers have their way with him. They'll take that person upstairs, to a small room on the upper floor; even I'm not allowed into that room. Then they'll draw straws, deciding who goes in and who stays out to hold guard. Some of them will join the culprit in the small room, only to emerge after a while and go to sleep for three days. Neither the prisoner nor his remains will be found inside."
523853, "Will they devour him or something?"
523854, "I'm telling you, I'm not allowed into that room."
523855, "Well, so do you most likely. Don't you?"
523856, "Do you want to know for sure?"
523857, "Well, I'm not telling you."
523858, "Right! I doesn't matter who did what; he's the head of the family, so it's him who is to bear responsibility. Dad did that for me too."
523859, "Is that so..."
523860, "Sounds legit. You are very slick, oynon!"
523861, "No. I'm an honest person."
523862, "Well, they are right."
523863, "Do it then!"
523864, "I'll reveal the gate for you if you reveal something to me as well. Fair barter. Deal?"
523865, "It depends on what you want."
523866, "And what does she want?"
523867, "Some! Thing! You should hear her tell stories, too. I'm completely at her mercy now... and I feel like I'll have to do whatever she tells me to. I don't get it at all... and I think I'll end up giving up my life for her."
523868, "What? Oh, please don't cry..."
523869, "Yes, yes... Either that-or she'll demand something that shouldn't be given away... She'll come here soon, she'll get back to her riddles... Oh, what can I do to stand up to her...? Perhaps Capella could help? Then again, maybe not..."
523870, "So what do you want me to reveal to you?"
523871, "It's just a story though..."
523872, "No it's not! Don't talk like you know anything about it! Klara has inexplicable power over me now... I'm so scared of her..."
523873, "Is there anything I could do to help?"
523874, "Reveal the ending of Clara's story to me! Remember, it's a story about an icy prince and a crystal flower. How does it end? I need to know! Then she can come here all she wants-I'd be ready, knowing everything! And she wouldn't be able to force me... I'll get unhooked!"
523875, "I don't have time for fancy stories."
523876, "Deal."
523877, "As time went by, the crystal flower became the greediest in the garden. It drank all the earth's juices. But most importantly, it also snatched all sunlight. The garden became so dark that even the air has turned cold."
523878, "Oh, oh... And what did the prince do when the time has come to pick the crystal flower?"
523879, "The prince killed the gardener."
523880, "The prince covered it with his own body."
523881, "The prince executed a crafty plan: he engineered it so that the gardener would pick a different flower instead of the crystal one."
523882, "Yeah, sounds right! It's all been coming to that... So did the flower end up all alone in an empty garden?"
523883, "Yes. It blossomed, spread its seeds all over the place, and a new garden grew, a hundred times more beautiful than the one before."
523884, "It did-and it kept growing, but it was also killing the garden. And so in the end it has withered too."
523885, "No. Nothing changed."
523886, "No, that can't be right... it doesn't feel right at all. I'll have to wait for Clara."
523887, "So that's how it is... Yes, that sounds right... What a bad prince! Why did he have to kill the simple flowers..."
523888, "They were arguing if the bandits could get out, but agreed that they couldn't. It was only Lisa and the other Lisa, I mean the Mole, that disagreed."
523889, "What were they saying?"
523890, "Well, the opinion of the majority is what matters."
523891, "Have the people that were talking ever been in that well at all?"
523892, "No, none of them have. Why do you ask?"
523893, "I want to get there, but I don' know how."
523894, "...They heard some kind of noise behind the Theatre. That particular night. Screams even. They are superstitious women though, so they agreed it was the earth crying."
523895, "The earth crying?"
523896, "There's something there, there must be. Or maybe someone. The earth has its own manner of speech. It 'screams with twyre'-you know the expression, right? But there may be something in the chambers below the Theatre..."
523897, "Perhaps... Anything's possible."
523898, "I'll try my luck there."
523899, "The Soul-and-a-Halves have told me a funny story... about crystal flowers or something."
523900, "Hmm... was that maybe the wrong thing to say? Eh? What do you think, Changeling?"
523901, "How do they even know that tale?"
523902, "No idea. The ending is really funny though..."
523903, "There's nothing funny about it! It's scary actually. It couldn't have made them laugh..."
523904, "They were totally hysterical. Especially when it got to that prince..."
523905, "They couldn't have laughed! What made them laugh? The prince getting desperate and thinking that a flower like this would never grow in his garden again? Or maybe the living flowers dying because the crystal one took everything from them-the water, the air, and even the light? Is it that bit?"
523906, "No, another one..."
523907, "Well, was it the gardener coming with the scissors and the prince making it so that he'd cut the living flowers instead of the crystal one? Or that terrible flower throwing out seeds, giving birth to a whole new garden-a hundred times more beautiful than the previous one, but having no real flowers?"
523909, "Okay, okay..."
523910, "Don't you threaten me! I've been threatened enough! And don't stick your nose into things you know nothing about!"
523911, "Do you want her to die?"
523912, "I don't let people die, I save them! That's a fact that can be confirmed by thousands of witnesses."
523913, "I don't like the sound of this."
523914, "Tell me how it ends!"
523915, "Get lost! And don't you ever cross me! I don't interfere with you cutting livers out of living people, now do I?! And just so that you know, I feel sorry for them! I could very well complicate your life quite a bit!"
523916, "You little bitch..."
523917, "Okay, okay, peace."
523918, "And how does it end?"
523919, "...Why do you ask? Hey, you're cheating! You're in cahoots with the Mother!"
523920, "No I'm not..."
523921, "Yeah, I think so."
523922, "Well, they are idiots! How do they even know the tale, I wonder?"
523923, "And what happens next?"
523924, "There was something else..."
523925, "That's the end. There couldn't have been anything else. They're lying!"
523926, "That was the bit."
523927, "Those idiots! They've no idea what they're laughing at..."
523928, "Yeah, you are one scary wench..."
523929, "Good luck to you, Clara."
523930, "Did I hear you right, master Burakh?"
523931, "You bet."
523932, "Judging by your expression, that's not what you expected to hear."
523933, "No. I thought you would be more sensible than that."
523934, "Sympathy? I thought it was worthy of respect."
523935, "And you are correct. Good luck concluding your work, master Burakh."
523936, "Thank you."
523937, "I don't believe you mean it."
523938, "I'm afraid that is unlikely to change. In all fairness, my plans are far from obvious to myself these days. Would you like to know a secret? I'm not who you think I am."
523939, "Seems so."
523940, "Well, I think you are a schemer."
523941, "Spare me your secrets."
523942, "I need no money. I was doing what I must."
523943, "How was it any of your concern anyway?"
523944, "That's a pity. Your words betray a generous soul, but still... you could use it. Do take it. I have no doubt you can put the money to good use."
523945, "You've convinced me."
523946, "No, I won't take it."
523947, "I am the Judge. It is my duty to see justice served."
523948, "I see."
523949, "What?"
523950, "What I was saying is that the deed as good as the one you are willing to perform must be rewarded approapriately."
523951, "What happened to him?"
523952, "The ruthless investigator that she is, Aglaya Lilich has ordered the opening of the Termitary that was previously locked down by the Olgimskys. In doing so, she has uncovered a few pieces of most valuable evidence. Having interrogated Vlad the Heavy, she has received his full and sincere avowal of guilt. And yet..."
523953, "Yes, what is it?"
523954, "...In truth, the catastrophic act that killed thousands of people was not a product of rational planning, but rather that of hesitancy and reluctance. That's the reason why they were trying to hide the outbreak; hesitancy and reluctance are quite common in younger people."
523955, "Younger people?"
523956, "Precisely. It is Vlad the Younger and not his father whom we should hold responsible for this terrifying crime. Vlad the Younger gave the order at his own risk... and then kept it a secret from his father. It was already too late when my noble ally and opponent learned of these developments... and so he took the blame for his son."
523957, "Don't call me that. I don't like it."
523958, "As you wish. So, will you listen to me?"
523959, "What do you want?"
523960, "What was he guilty of?"
523961, "Long story short, when he gave--or pretended to give--the order to lock down the Termitary, he was already fully aware of the highly contagious disease that the Kin had fallen victim to. Apparently, he imagined that some natural traits of the Steppe people and their amazing vitality would allow them to do away with the plague on their own..."
523962, "Did he now?"
523963, "Well, keeping in mind how volatile these people may be, the Olgimskys were also striving to protect the town from an onset of blood-crazed plague-sufferers. In other words, if they didn't try to hide their decision, it may have been understood and supported. But then Simon's death wrought havoc with their plans."
523964, "So where are you going with this?"
523965, "So what can I do?"
523966, "Report this to the governor... Or even his wife, since I heard of some bad blood between you and Alexander. If you won't, I have good reasons to believe the Inquisitor will order Vlad the Heavy's execution."
523967, "Why can't you tell the governor... or his wife, yourself?"
523968, "Because they trust the Kains even less than they trust the Burakhs. Especially now that Katerina feels... what kind of powerful emotions you have stirred in the steely Inquisitor. You left a strong impression on her yesterday. Maria feels it too..."
523970, "That's a surprise."
523971, "That is absolutely none of your business!"
523972, "Indeed. So, will you help... your benefactor? Or, shall we say, your partner in misfortune..."
523973, "Really?"
523974, "They say this is what merchant families do... They will happily backstab one another in their everyday affairs-yet when the heir is in danger, they put it all behind and rush to the rescue. They'll stop at nothing to pull the opponent apart then; with their teeth if needs be..."
523975, "What do you want from me?"
523976, "That's just my perfume."
523977, "'Whichever comes'? What do you mean?"
523978, "Well... they want a person... an expiatory sacrifice. Father or son... they don't care... they couldn't tell anyway. A family is a single body for them. You can cut a thief's right hand off or the left one... it's all the same. Not for Georgiy though! You can't see his scheme... it's political."
523979, "How is it political?"
523980, "Men... come and go. The family stays. And what matters is who rules it... Georgiy is leaving... So he's setting the table for his heirs... The terrible Maria... and Khan... he doesn't need a young... clever... vigorous... Olgimsky ruler."
523981, "Why isn't he in charge?"
523982, "He is a nobody now. A short-lived ruler... That's because we've got this... wench instead now... I won't say anything else though. You're also getting too close to her... for your own good..."
523983, "Let's get back to business. So it's up to the Kin?"
523984, "Is Big Vlad easier to handle?"
523985, "He is old... he will die soon... And he's compromised by the Termitary deal anyway... Oh, it's a fine scheme! A blow that will hit everyone... my husband too... It was him he sent you to... it's him he's planning to hold responsible later... oh, Georgiy, Georgiy... it's a scheme that would befit Simon!"
523986, "What should I do?"
523987, "Leave us alone... I've seen through his game straight away... go to the Mother... let the Kin devour whoever they want... it's all over anyway. Over... Let everyone choose how they die at least..."
523988, "He sent me to you, not to your husband."
523989, "I want to solemnly ask you for assistance. I beg you to help me with a cause that's not only good, but also crucial for the whole town. Save a few children's lives."
523990, "Are they in danger?"
523991, "Yes. The terrible Clara wants to get personal gain at the cost of their childish magnanimity-and their lives. And I cannot do anything! She breeds ill blood between us! I will do anything for you if you help me save them."
523992, "Why these particular kids?"
523993, "They are special. Both me and Clara care for the same qualities of theirs... only from different angles. It is what we need-what is useful to us, if you will. Independence. Importance. Standing. It's just that I care for their personalities, and she needs something else... she wants to sacrifice them for something!"
523994, "You want me to look after them?"
523995, "I acknowledge you. You are Capella."
523996, "Funny, is it not? So you do acknowledge me. Just looks at us-a bare-legged girl and a disenfranchised outcast, orphaned too... you are a son of an odongh, true, but that only makes it worse-oh, please do not be offended! But we are ridiculous-and yet there is more to our eyes."
523997, "More to our eyes?"
523998, "Our eyes speak true-no more than three days will pass before you and I turn from tiny creatures into two pillars carrying the burden of the supreme power... Unless we make mistakes-oh, I hope we never do! And so you will help me, will you not? Thus helping yourself... you do understand, don't you?"
523999, "Oh, so that's where you were going with this..."
524000, "But what exactly do you want?"
524001, "Why is she so terrible?"
524002, "She is strong and dangerous. She is stronger than me, for I create and she destroys. She does indeed-that is her nature! She doesn't heal, she merely kills the disease! You should see the ones she'd saved... She is stronger because she is made of lies; I, on the other hand, am the White Mistress, and so I am plain to see..."
524003, "Why does she need the kids?"
524004, "You are not a Mistress yet..."
524005, "But I shall be one soon, very soon! Think about it, Artemy. You do not know what it's like... when a freckled bare-legged nymph breaks apart, and a graceful alabaster swallowtail emerges in all its glory, its wings covering the people, its love engulfing the world..."
524006, "Yes! Help them, Artemy. And I will repay you. I am begging you now as a child, but you will have the gratitude of a Mistress. The change is bound to happen very, very soon. You know that the future is an open book to me. Help me attain power-and I will help you keep yours."
524007, "I don't need power."
524008, "But you need to win. Or don't you? Don't you feel obligated, clenched, trapped by fate? Oh, you do need to win! Else you will never become yourself. Let us help each other. Let us be noble and generous."
524009, "Okay. Let's say we have a deal."
524010, "I'll just do it for you, no need for gratitude."
524011, "If I do look after the kids, it will be for them-not for you."
524012, "Dunno anyone by that name."
524013, "A thief girl."
524014, "The Changeling."
524015, "A holy healer."
524016, "I dunno, I'm tellin' you. Got every thief girl covered, half of 'em called Roses, the rest-Hard Candies. Whaddya want from me?"
524017, "Fine..."
524018, "There's some lass lurking by the carriages at the Station... May be her? Dunno."
524021, "Nah, the lamp lamp stuff, like what you use to lurk in cellars or sewage or something. And whaddyathink? We followed 'em, naturally. So they went to the Theatre, to its backyard-and disappeared... with all the kerosene! And that was the last we've seen of 'em. Could it be they've buried treasure, I wonder?"
524022, "No, I dont' think so."
524023, "Yeah, I know. We scoured the place. Found nothin', neither hole nor ditch nor secret passage nor anything. But the Theatre is an evil place, it's got character... You've heard of the Prophet, right? The guy that's made a splash like the day before yesterday?"
524024, "That's all nonsense."
524025, "I've heard of him."
524063, "Yes, I was."
524064, "I didn't expect Aglaya to be so selfless... Hmm... Doesn't look like her, really. Is it possible there's foul play here?"
524065, "Don't you get smart on me."
524066, "So, the only thing left to do is to test the panacea, right? And then notifying the Powers That Be of your success?"
524067, "The Powers That Be don't bother me. My conscience is clean."
524068, "Oh my... What do we do? Let me think... Shut up, I'll figure it out myself! Thinking, thinking, thinking... Oh yeah! How about using the panacea?"
524069, "What are you talking about?"
524070, "Well, I've infected you, didn't I? I didn't...? Ah whatever, it doesn't matter... So what are you gonna do?"
524071, "What do you expect me to do?"
524072, "Will that be enough for you? Will you be satisfied?"
524073, "I'm a reasonable guy! So-abslolutely. If it works, that is."
524074, "Watch me then."
524075, "Later."
524076, "The goods are getting more expensive by the day! We had the Inquisitor's representatives come here recently, shook hands and all. They said we were doing a good thing. Encouraged us to do more. Paid nothing. How's that fair?"
524077, "What do you need money for anyway?"
524078, "You think mapmaking's easy? My scouts are dying like flies! The ones the disease doesn't get, a marauder's knife does!"
524079, "So will you let me have a look?"
524080, "So what are you going to do next?"
524081, "What have I done to deserve that?"
524082, "What, am I wrong? Just look how you're walking... or remember what you've been doing!"
524083, "As if you saw me..."
524084, "Who knows, who knows..."
524085, "Well, at least I'm the star comedian-and you're just a substitute."
524086, "Who knows, who knows... So why have you come?"
524087, "I need to see the Inquisitor."
524088, "Got a death wish, mate?"
524089, "That would be enough, thank you. I want to see the Inquisitor."
524090, "Oh, look at that! He wants to! On a silver platter, dare I guess? Well, she's not in!"
524091, "Where is... she then?"
524092, "What?"
524093, "Aglaya vowed to punish the Kains for persecuting Rubin and thus allegedly preventing him from making the medicine that could save us all. Can you imagine? The hypocrisy! Oh, but we'll stand up to her!"
524094, "How is that hypocritical?"
524095, "Oh, a medicine like that would be extremely disadvantageous to Aglaya! Seems like that is something she should be striving to find, doesn't it? But I promise you-if she finds out that someone's crossed her... well, let's just say I don't envy the bastard. Poor Rubin... You weren't assisting him, I hope?"
524096, "What on earth are you yapping about?"
524097, "...I was doing something else."
524098, "You just wait, Victor will find a way to cut her claws. He knows whose skeleton lies in her closet. She can dream all she likes about persecuting the creator of the medicine, but her scheme will fall through if her game is exposed. We had no sympathy for Rubin, yet now we're on his side!"
524099, "Wait a second! Are you telling the truth? She wants to get rid of the creator of the panacea?"
524100, "You need proof? Speak to Victor then. We are only here as a resistance force. To hell with the upcoming tyranny! To hell with hypocritical investigators covering up personal agendas! Such an Inquisitor will do nothing for our town!"
524101, "How exactly are you planning to stand up to her? ...By standing proudly on a scaffold?"
524102, "Pardon me?"
524103, "No, nothing... Never mind."
524104, "How is that possible? Isn't the Inquisitor here to fight the epidemic?"
524105, "She is and she isn't. It's exactly like you say-on paper. But in reality an unsolicited assistant is the worst enemy to this proud woman."
524106, "No, I don't understand this at all."
524107, "I feel like you're talking about me..."

524386, "As you wish."

524625, "Big Vlad won't be in until 11 o'clock. I need to survive until then..."

524647, "That's odd... Impossible, actually. It must have been me, there's no other way."
524648, "You're back... What did Grandfather say?"
524649, "I haven't seen anyone's grandfather. There must be some misunderstanding."

524657, "I can induce a hypnotic state in people-provided they consent, of course. Then they will answer any question truthfully."
524658, "Enough. I need time to make up my mind. Now go outside, walk around the house, and you will get to my wife's side. Afterwards, come back to me. If your conversation yields no unpleasant surprises, I shall decide on your future from then on."

524738, "It's time to lay my hands on a dying man. There was blood shed at the station this morning and many people lie wounded or dead. Saburov's man is keeping watch. He will tell me what has to be done."
524739, "I can return to Alexander now. The miracle was a success."
524740, "*** I am who I am. The harbinger. What has happened is proof of that! Who is going to challenge that I was sent here to perform deeds in righteousness? No one. This town is the outset of my journey; not the destination."
524741, "This never happened before! Could the miraculous power that enters the world through my hands bring death as well as life? How will I explain this to Alexander? I can't return to him unless I have saved someone... There must be another injured man somewhere..."
524742, "Here is a new task for you. It is said that someone resembling you has murdered our townsfather, Simon Kain. But now I am sure that the Kains are not telling the whole truth, and that the murder story was invented to conceal something grim that they know about... or suspect."
524743, "All right. I'll give it a try."
524744, "No! I'm afraid of visiting these people. I can sense how dangerous they are to me! Their very name, it seems, is something the whole of my nature protests against..."
524745, "All right, I've made up my mind. I'm ready to see Georgiy."
524747, "Why would I? You're helping me. So I have nothing to hide from you. I'm going to see Katerina."
524748, "Alexander has tasked me with finding out the truth about Simon's death from Georgiy. It makes me feel uneasy..."
524749, "And how will you find out the truth? How will you make him reveal it?"
524751, "But it is not of Georgiy that you should be wary. I feel that the Kain's plot was conceived in a different mind. It all comes from Maria, who is about to challenge my position of a Mistress... But do not even think of approaching her yet. She's very dangerous. Your formula will not work on someone who has a Mistress's abilities..."
524752, "All right. I'll follow your advice."
524753, ""
524754, "I must say, if it were up to me, I'd have had you executed without further ado. You owe your life to the Bachelor, in a way, for he told us that although there is little doubt left that you are a changeling spawned by the Steppe, the shape you assumed when you visisted upon him was unexpectedly uncharacteristic of any demon he knows of."
524755, "All right. Where will I find her?"
524756, "So, my dear guest?"
524757, "I have nothing to say."
524758, ""
524759, "What is it?"
524760, "Goodbye, Maria."
524761, "Umm-you're still here?"
524763, "Maria wishes to say that-"
524764, "Maria has already said all that she wished to say. Don't be surprised. You wanted to ask me something, did you not? Feel free to ask."
524765, "Georgiy, oh Georgiy, I know of you this: you didn't like Simon, and you were no twin of his. Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
524766, "......Ask away."
524767, "That's enough. There's nothing more that I wish to know."
524768, "I've talked to Georgiy. He answered my questions."
524769, "To you, Clara. Or more specifically, to your sister. If the epidemic does begin-and I see nothing that could prevent that-the search for Simon's killer will very soon turn into a search for the one who caused the outbreak. If I remember correctly, you said that your sister is still somewhere in town..."
524770, "See you tomorrow. I'm so glad it was you who gave me shelter! You'll see how it will pay off in the future..."
524771, "'The Hooks (Truth Revealing Itself)'"
524772, "Katerina wants to test my powers as well. But how can she? This is, perhaps, the most important thing..."
524773, "A terrifying ordeal lies ahead of me. I will have to show my power to Georgiy Kain, the brother of Simon-who was murdered by someone unknown... I will get Georgiy's consent; question him in a way that I alone can question people and the truth will reveal itself..."
524774, "The road to Georgiy's desolate heart lies through Maria's bedroom. Why is my own heart beating so hard? As if Maria will see through me and discover something I myself have no awareness of... So scary..."
524775, "What was it, for goodness' sake? I fail to understand something-and my ineptitude leads me right into their trap... Was it her that instilled such terror in me? Away with the doubts! Georgiy is waiting."
524776, "My heart is beating something horrible. How could something this terrifying ever happen? I can go back to the Rod now..."
524777, "*** It is as if a shroud fell off his eyes... However humble I am, it is impossible not to witness the brilliance of the power that marks me. I am a healer, well versed in the mysteries of the human heart. Almost a prophet, as every sign confirms. But what am I to do with this gift?"
524778, "The Crucible... the residence of the Kains. For some reason, thinking of this place, I begin to shudder and my feelings wander between fear and anger. Georgiy is here."
524779, "Here lives the fearsome Maria Kaina. I can't avoid seeing her now... why did I ever come to this place?"
524780, "And then there's the second newcomer! Just as sinister... In fact he seems even scarier than the Bachelor. Why else would they call him the Ripper? Why is he hiding somewhere in Earth, so close to me? What does he want?"
524783, "Ask them? About the Ripper? They might know nothing about him either..."
524784, "The important thing is to find out if the whelp was really killed! Go to the guttersnipes right away. Forget about Grief; you're a girl after all... anything could happen... And the boys... they won't hurt you. Do you hear me? On the other hand... never mind, do whatever you like. Just do this little trifle for me, will you? I'll reward you."
524785, "A trifle, you say? Why, I'll get acquainted with those boys all right. And I'm not scared of the thieves either."
524786, "Turns out you're a dark one, Anna who they call Angel. I won't do anything for you."
524787, "All right, if you say so. I'll ask. I feel so sorry for you..."
524788, "Oh, do ask, my dear! You see, my life is in danger. And I'll have a present for you afterwards... So what do you say?"
524789, "Your life is in danger? What does that have to do with... ah, never mind. I'll find out the truth anyway."
524790, ""
524791, "Keep close to our lot. Do you like wild beasts? Like wolves or cats?"
524792, "Did you see a man calling himself the Ripper?"
524793, "I do. I like people, too."
524794, "Nah... I asked him to do the right thing, is all. He's not a thug for hire... Scary enough, though: he'd offed four armed robbers at the Station. See this gun here? He took it from them and sold it to us."
524795, "All right. Thanks for the story."
524796, "I've found out everything... Turns out you're an odd one, Anna."
524797, "And this Notkin! Don't you think he's a little cutthroat? It's good that he and his friend Kaspar are in a feud, or they'd have got to us by now!"
524798, "Now, Anna, there's no need. . You don't know what you're doing. I'm glad to have helped you."
524799, "Here lives a small flock of orphans. They call themselves the Soul-and-a-Halves. That scary ripper, who calls himself the Haruspex, has already met with their leader..."
524800, "'Those with the Freedom of Choice'"
524801, "Anna told me to ask the stray children at the warehouse about which side the terrifying messenger has taken. That monster clad in leather, licensed to cut all manner of flesh."
524802, "It doesn't matter to me anymore, what side this Haruspex will take.... Three times in a single day I saw his fate decided. Condemned by one, set free by another, and then assisted by destiny itself. Behold though, how much suffering it has brought!"
524803, "*** A gallery of hideous portraits! It's as though the men, women, children and freaks of nature are each trying to be more evil than their nearest neighbour! What should I do with them? Will I always be confronted with choices this terrifying?"
524804, "Even if he is, you're not welcome here until six o'clock."
524805, "How about I just break in?"
524806, "This is where Bachelor Dankovsky is staying. He's hunting my father's murderer. He's supposed to be here after 6 o'clock in the evening."
524819, "When was Simon last seen?"
524820, "He sent Isidor home. Then, an hour later, he came to this hall to see us. He announced his plans to withdraw to the Focus and receive no one. He told us not to approach the Focus and to fast for a week, partaking of neither meat nor water. Then, in the morning, he was found dead."
524821, "How was he found?"
524822, "The servants discovered him in the morning. The room had been ransacked. Everything that was breakable had been broken. His disfigured, contorted body bore signs of terrible suffering. His neck was twisted, his spine broken... I think. No one has touched the body. It is currently inside the Focus and will remain there for the prescribed amount of time."
524823, "Do you suspect anyone?"
524826, "How was the body discovered?"
524827, "How was the body discovered?"
524828, "You are all his heirs. Wouldn't you all benefit from his death? Didn't the old man rather overstay his welcome in the world?"
524829, "His death is a challenge to our continued existence. We are neither insane nor suicidal."
524830, "Who do you suspect?"
524836, "Well, Simon did get in there somehow..."
524845, "What is the Focus?"
524846, "All right. So how can I help you?"

524883, "The town is small and rather unexceptional, isn't it? But there are all kinds of people here. The simple folk-and the more remarkable ones. The former will tell you more than they know. The latter know way more than they're ever going to let out. Keep a close eye on them. Your victory depends on it."
524884, "And who are these remarkable people?"
524885, "There are twenty-something of them. Easily distinguished... by their lodgings or their presence. They're called many names: The Bound, The Fated, The Adherents, 'The Gobo's Taglur', The Town's Circle. Simon preferred their company to any other."
524886, "Why?"
524887, "Because it is they that will decide the fate of this town. Don't be distracted by the fact that some of them look insignificant or disreputable. They will earn their worth, you just give them time. They're the most important joints of the town."
524888, "Why are you telling me all this?"
524889, "Each day one of them will try death by the tooth. Each will put their life at risk. And each one that dies is important. Some of them may take the keys to victory to the grave... mind that the keys are yours, while the grave is theirs. Others will do the opposite. Don't waste your chance to condemn someone who may get in your way."
524890, "How do you know what is helpful and what gets in the way?"
524891, "Okay, okay, all right, dropping you more hints would be cheating... shutting up now. Allow me to conclude then. Each Bound you save will influence the finale of your... adventure. Each of them has their own goals and motives. It may so happen that those who seek a different ending survive, and then... well, you've been warned."
524892, "Okay, I'll take that into account and will be careful."
524893, "Is that a sect or something?"
524894, "No... There used to be a pagan game called 'taglur.' A roundelay of sorts. 'A taglur' means 'a kin circle', and Gobo is a character from a local epic. And so the people that Simon was intrested in the most are called the Gobo's Taglur. Some of them don't even know one another."
524895, "How did Simon choose them?"
524897, "I won't do a thing for anyone until I get to the bottom of what goes on here."
524898, "My victory depends on me. No one else."
524899, "That's what you think. You'll have plenty of time to realize just how wrong you are. Your fight is not a fight of action. You'll need middlemen. Cause-and-effect chains. Tools. The tools to act out your... script."
524900, "If I ever need someone, I'll find them."
524901, "Not anyone would be good enough. There are few people here capable of doing something worthwhile."
524902, "How many?"
524903, ""
524904, "There is something in particular we feel the urge to warn you about. When you speak to the Bound, please choose your words carefully. Do not worry, you will easily be able to make out what kind of a person is standing before you, an observant man that you are. So use that skill when dealing with the Bound; some of them are indeed worth insulting, whereas others need to be treated with utmost respect."
524905, "I have no idea what you're talking about."
524906, "Every line you utter will have consequences. News spreads rapidly around here. If you spoil your reputation in one place, you'll have to reap what you have sown in another. Restore your good name in the south, and you'll receive a warmer welcome in the north. They will heed every word you say-and you'll be rewarded."
524907, "Not by means of money, I hope?"
524908, "A handful of money... It's not a dialogue fee, don't get me wrong! Never refuse to take small sums of money from the Bound. That would not belittle you in any fashion, but would rather demonstrate that you appreciate the local customs."
524909, "All right, I'll keep local customs in mind."
524911, "If I ever engage in conversations with someone, it won't be for personal gain."
524913, "Good."
524914, "How so?"
524915, "It's a symbolic 'godspeed'. The heftier the sum, the better your luck is supposed to become. So conversations get more profitable as your reputation goes up, esteemed Bachelor."
524916, "Each conversation will bring you a small profit-depending on the outcome, of course."
524917, "Depending on the outcome?"
524918, "How small a profit?"
524919, "I see."
524920, "Why no meat or water?"
524921, "Our explanation is that he wanted to be mourned beforehand-as is the custom with the local people. This is very like him."
524922, "So he knew in advance that he would die?"
524924, "What is the Focus?"
524928, "Now listen closely. The time for collusion, secrets, and alliances has come. I am going to ask something of you. I am not used to that. I'm used to holding the reins-but you are not harnessed, so it would be unacceptable to address you in this manner. I find solace in the fact that my request will be welcome with you. It fits the style of your venture."
524933, "Regardless of the outcome?"
524934, "Why? Any person is free to take on responsibilities-or not."
524935, "Wrong. Or are you one of those hypocrites that think responsibility is a signed agreement? A free man, if he is truly free, is responsible for everything that happens around him. He would be a petty slave of circumstances otherwise. A slave of Inevitability!"
524936, "But you think I'm different, don't you?"
524937, "Everything is up to you. I know that you are capable of something no one else is-not even my parents or Simon! Neither of them were free. Could you become the first free person I am to meet?"
524938, "So I'm a slave of inevitability then..."
524939, "Freedom is a great burden. The fate of a free person is rather bleak."
524940, "Are my ears deceiving me? Was it you uttering these words? No, you're just dodging the answer and mocking me... A free heart can conquer any other effortlessly. Only a free person is worthy of love. Only a free person can work true miracles. Here comes a man-and I saw him glimmer with the light of freedom in my dream. Could I be mistaken again?"
524941, "I am a miserable woman, en-Daniil. You are the only person I will confess this to. I am a woman of power. A princess with an unbearable burden upon her shoulders-and no one to share it with... This weight is about to break me. Forever."
524942, "Fine. I'll take care of these people."
524943, "Forever is a frightening word; but you're exaggerating."
524944, "I'm not an adventurer, and my job is no venture. I hope it never becomes one."
524945, "I apologize if my words come across as mangled and silly-I am truly not used to asking. But the nature of my request demands complete and selfless humility. Just imagine me begging and kneeling! And believe me, I do feel that way."
524946, "No need to kneel. What did you want to talk about?"
524947, "Today's death was the first, but it won't be the last. Simon has opened the score of irreplaceable victims. Soon their number will multiply. I beg you to preserve the lives of several people when the lines of their fortune cross yours. Before any of them dies, there will be a moment when you will be able to intervene. I know that for a fact."
524948, "Who are these people?"
524949, "That doesn't matter. What was destined to happen, will happen. You can be whatever you want to be-but not a coward choosing to hear no evil and run away from reality! I will give you a list of those I know of. These people are Bound... to you."
524952, "Yes, you'd better be polite. I don't take kindly to orders. I am a creature of liberty."
524953, "I'd kneel myself before a lady as charming as you."
524954, "How?"
524955, "I had a vision. I'm clairvoyant. I will become the Nocturnal Queen soon-just like my beloved sorceress mother used to be."
524956, "Dreams lie."
524957, "So you want me to take care of them?"
524958, "They do to you, Bachelor, but not to me. Or can you confidently promise me that the people I'm going to name to you will stay alive for the next two weeks?"
524959, "How can I promise you that? I won't be staying here for long-and so I have no way of knowing what may happen in my absence."
524960, "Then do not judge what is true and what is not, celebrity doctor. I have never seen a dream this clear before. The links of Gobo's Taglur are bound to die, and we are all bound to weep for the loss. You will be the chief weeper."
524961, "Why?"
524962, "I'm not that good at separating the interweaving lines of life, but my intuition is superb. Stay alert, Bachelor. Watch the condemned extend their hands towards you begging for your help. Will you deny it to them? They are essential for your victory..."
524963, "Everything happens."
524964, "That is out of the question, Maria. I fight, lose, and win on my own."
524965, "...And to turn back the wheel that is about to crush us. Yes, this is my last hope. Perhaps at least you are master of your fate? Even Simon cannot boast this title now..."
524966, "How would you reward me if in ten days' time these people were still alive? Would you go with me to the Capital?"
524967, "Of course I can."
524968, "I'm only staying here for a day or two anyway."
524969, "Please refer to Eva Yan with such ideas, Bachelor. She will gladly go to the Capital with you-just remind her to slip into something before she leaves the premises of her house. Well, don't let it go to your head. I will probably be able to reward you... in my own way. You won't be disappointed."
524970, "Let's go back to the people you worry about-even though I cannot say I share your anxiety. You've failed to scare me."
524971, "No, Maria, I can't take on a responsibility this huge. I'm sorry."
524972, "You shouldn't speak badly about Eva. She offered me room and board and was very welcoming."
524973, "I have no doubts about that; you were the only thing she could babble about for the last few days. It does you credit to stand up for her though. I respect that and will not mock her in your presence again."
524974, "Yes, please be so kind."
524975, "Forget it."
524976, "Bound?"
524979, "There is a tight spring of power within each of these people. Each of them can break the routine of human existence and become something greater. They are standing on the verge of their humanity, gazing into the realm where they could serve a different, higher purpose-without even knowing it. Moreover, they are bound to make the leap-in one way or another. That's why we call them simply the Bound."
524981, "But how is their fate... bound to mine? Did you say my victory depended on them? How?"
524982, "I don't know. I'm not a Mistress yet. The future is not as clear to me as I would prefer; but I can feel the present. I can already distinguish a dubious guess from the pulse of the precise knowledge devoid of words and images. These people are bound to you. Your lives are connected. I wouldn't have asked you to take care of them otherwise."
524983, "All right. If it is truly within my power, I'll do my best to save their lives."
524984, "Are you clairvoyant or something?"
524985, "Ah, yes... you haven't been told, have you? It didn't even cross my mind that someone may be unaware of my abilities. No one here dares doubt them-for they are evident. Yes, the Mistress of every ruling house possesses special abilities. I am learning to see the future and transform the present."
524986, "Forgive me, but I don't believe in this type of phenomenons."
524987, "This fact offers your words a different degree of authenticity."
524988, "Will you comply with my request? Will you save the lives of the people I name to you? Answer me... before going back to Eva."
524989, "No, Maria. I need to go back to the Capital as soon as possible."
524990, "You sound delusional. I'm sorry, but your uncle's death has messed with your head. You need to come to your senses."
524991, "I always follow my principles. It doesn't matter which lines of fortune cross; there'll be no exceptions."
524992, "When and how are these people supposed to die?"
524993, "'Bound to die.' No need to shy away from it. That is also implied."
524994, "You didn't answer my question, Maria. How and when will they die?"
524996, "How do you know that Eva had asked me to come back?"
524997, "I know Eva. She wants to safeguard you from my nocturnal intrigues, doesn't she? She strives to touch the mysteries of our family... to learn the game we're playing. Well, talk to her. Perhaps you two will manage to uncover some bits and pieces of the Kains' dark conspiracy against humanity. But you haven't given me an answer. What will it be?"
524998, "I will do as you ask, Maria. My honour bids me to. And you'd be better off not giving me cheek. You won't like me when I'm angry."
524999, "No. I don't want to... bind myself with an unnecessary promise."
525035, "Any interesting news?"
525036, "People say all sorts of things over a bottle! They say no one has ever seen a shabnak, but she's been heard. Heard by prophets, drunkards, housemates, and those who happened to walk past the Crucible that night. I wonder what the bastards were doing there! They probably wanted to get another glimpse of lovely Maria in the window!"
525037, "What did they hear?"
525038, "They've heard a wheeze, heard sobbing and breathing-very heavy, as if it were a whale. Those are apparent signs of the hair-eater. Here and there; by the window, by the wall; behind the corner. Scared shitless, people then come here to forget themselves and the nightmare."
525039, "Breathing so heavy that it can be heard through walls? Well, that whale hasn't got much time left. I'm telling you this as a doctor."
525040, "It's possible. It's also possible that twyrine addiction goes hand in hand with poetry. Poetic minds tend to exaggerate things. But are they really so deprived of imagination that they have to tell the same tale over and over again? That's the concern that's gnawing at me... "
525041, "Curious."
525042, "You can hear things like that at any corner."
525043, "That's what's troubling me. If there's a ruthless killer hiding at every corner, then it's time to take to arms!"
525044, "It is. Do you know where I could get a weapon?"
525045, "I do, Bachelor, but it's an issue that should only be brought up when you're fresh as a daisy. Guns are prohibited here. As you can see, our morals are quite peaceful. Need I make an example? Just take the Bone Stake Lot!"
525046, "..."
525047, "Let's wait until nightfall."
525048, "Perhaps. And perhaps the bottle divers are accessory to the murder themselves? The disease is there, true, but..."
525049, "No, old boy. It's not their idiocy that makes them go looking for the shabnak. No man can enter Focus. I'm telling you this as a professional and a legitimate architect. My idea of what is and is not possible is rather uncommon too, trust me. Still, no man could have gotten to Simon there."
525050, "All right. So what are your drinking buddies saying?"
525164, "Everyone is after a female figure. What is this, the vestiges of matriarchy? The Snake Mother, the abyss, yadda yadda?"
525165, "Hmm. Actually, an unusual girl's been walking around our town lately. Did you know? They say she can work miracles with her bare hands. If I happen to meet her, I'll test her miraculous capabilities. She can probably ease my headache, right?"
525166, "One more paranormalist... The concentration of anomalies on such a small piece of land is beyond my comprehension."
525167, "She heals the sick and incapacitated. Perhaps she's a healer, perhaps a saint, and perhaps she's just a fraud. I like to believe she's a saint; the world around us is rather low on miracles."
525168, "She's a fraud for sure."
525169, "Things like this happen, but science is unable to explain them."
525170, "What else can the girl do?"
525171, "You seem to be depressed too."
525172, "The Dream Mistresses are silent. This is both sad and strange... Quite! Sad and strange. Even lady Katerina won't bestow her poisonous psalms upon us."
525173, "Tell me about the Dream Mistresses, Peter."
525174, "...Mistresses used to have some inexplicable, magnetic, motherly power over us. Katerina's problem is that she's a turncoat. You can't just stop in your tracks between the ridge and the abyss; you have to either climb or fall. Falling is easy; climbing is commendable."
525175, "What do you mean?"
525176, "Nothing, really. She's a false Mistress. That is what bothers me. She doesn't have the right to see things. Seriously, my twyrine daydreams are better suited to change our life-because I am at least honest with myself and true to my conscience! I've never betrayed anyone. All my life I've only been doing the things that I believed to be true creative work!"
525177, "Change? I thought the clairvoyants see the inevitable."
525178, "We don't have clairvoyants any longer. We are orphans. Blind puppies in the darkness. Yeah... "
525179, "Never mind. Have a drink."
525180, "Hey, calm down, mate... Faithfulness is worthy of respect and betrayal is worthy of despise."
525181, "Sorry, but I have to go."
525182, "You people have a lifestyle quite unlike any other."
525224, "Are you sure?"
525225, "Root"
525226, "I spent the night in thought and recollection, trying to trace the logic of the supernatural retribution that has befallen our community. It has been revealed to my wife that there is a creature among us who is to blame for all that is happening. I've gone through a list of possible suspects. I have it here in front of me. Every one of these people could turn out to be the criminal, the one that brought this disaster down upon us."
525227, "But how am I supposed to do it, father? ... I can call you that now, right?"
525228, "First of all, you must gain the trust of the person I believe to be the criminal responsible for this. Anyone would find the task complicated and demanding-except for you; since all you have to do is to predict the slightest movement of their-ehm-their soul. Do something for them; raise their spirits; astonish them; surely you can."
525229, "Yes, father. I'll do my duty."
525231, "Let justice prevail. Mercy to the innocent; a reckoning to the guilty."
525232, "I'm ready to fulfil your request."
525233, "Really? Well then, godspeed. Aspity is standing in your way, and woe is her if she is guilty. And should she keep mum, Vlad the Younger will gladly show you the shortest way into the depth of her dark soul. Your path is blessed, Clara. Go."
525234, "I'm going."
525235, "Just don't be angry with me... Whatever happened to mercy for the penitent?"
525236, ""
525237, "I'm beginning to like you... When I look at you I get this strange feeling that you're the closest person I have in the world. It's like a spell."
525238, "Could you tell me about Aspity then? You know who that is, right?"
525239, "How could I not! A most interesting person. So you've met her already? That was quick... What do you need her for?"
525240, "So you believe she's an avenger? An embodiment of divine retribution? Isn't that too grand a role for her?"
525241, "No... I saw her just a little while ago. Can't forget her eyes. Languid, but also very keen and intent. Sardonic. And before that, she used to act as if I didn't exist. She preferred to curse my father, threatening to ruin him. It's all really, really strange..."
525242, "Yes, it would do good to speak with him. That's where I can find a hook..."
525243, "And that is true, Vlad Olgimsky. There is no one closer to you than me."
525244, ""
525245, "What's this now? Bah... so skinny..."
525246, "I've come to warn you... You're in danger!"
525247, "Aspity... I'd crush her with a single stare... if I ever deigned her worthy of my notice."
525248, "Your head's just like your belly, all fat and no brain! I don't need your money!"
525249, "Obesity often causes heart failure. If you get my drift."
525250, ""
525251, "You are insistent... pushy, even. If you're disowning our kinship, then why the friendly look?"
525252, "I need to talk to you. To confide in you, if you like."
525253, "...Listen here, nimble darling. If you really want to have a nice conversation with me, then bring me Burakh. Know who that is? I see you do... I can't leave my house now, and he needs me badly!"
525254, "Fine... I'll do the whisper. But if I do find him, you owe me that conversation."
525255, "It's for the better."
525256, ""
525257, "What's your business here?"
525258, "Aspity claims she's holding the key to your destiny. Go and see her."
525259, "I'll visit this woman of yours. Show me where she lives."
525260, "It's the only house with a cellar in the quarter which corners on the Abattoir and runs adjacent to the cemetery."
525261, "None, just loitering."
525262, ""
525263, "I've told him. He will come."
525264, "He's been here already. What did you want to talk about? Ask quickly."
525265, "Aspity, oh Aspity, I know of you this: you incited the Kin to riot! Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
525266, "...What do you want to know?"
525267, "You bitch!"
525268, "Don't you hurt me, I'll be of use to you yet. Tell them I'm not to blame. Of course if it hadn't been for me, nothing would've happened-but that's not all, is it?"
525269, "What use could I have for you, a murderer and a wraith?"
525270, "Which of us is the reason for everything? Which of us is a figurine with the clot of a living soul residing in her but for a while? Which of us is the true shabnak-adyr? You'll see in the end... I'll be of service to you yet, Changeling! Spare me... don't let... don't let your sister out... don't let her take over..."
525271, "Why did you call me that?"
525272, "That is your great blessing... You're a thief now-having stolen the name and fate of another... Beware of the Law... You'll live through your persecution and emerge triumphant... maybe."
525273, "I'll think it over."
525274, "I spoke with Aspity. I got inside her soul."
525275, "I never doubted you would. What is in there?"
525276, "Yes, she's guilty!"
525277, "All the same, she's not guilty."
525278, "I have been told that she felt ill after talking to you. Now she is dying."
525279, "Ah, I hope for that so!"
525280, "Talking to you makes me feel... ill."
525281, "It will pass, Aspity. It will."
525282, "Now I shall speak to you of the higher causes of the unfolding disaster. Like roots, they are invisible to the eye. When one plucks a weed, one removes merely the consequence, not the underlying cause. You are the only one capable of a true victory, and that is why I am going to tell you about the roots. So listen."
525283, "I trust you, Katerina. What you're saying is wise and true."
525284, "No! This teaching is all heresy and falsehood. I'm not doing this..."
525285, ""
525286, "We'll prepare for the hard times... I hope they don't last long."
525287, "And so, my girl...?"
525288, "I've changed my mind... Something external confused me, making me answer as impudently as that."
525289, "Go. But do not neglect my advice. To speak words of truth to anyone, you need to find the right way to start the conversation... And Grace is a very unusual girl... with a quaint soul and a most vulnerable heart."
525290, "I'll start the conversation all right. I'll tell you everything when I'm back."
525291, "Don't mind me. I just need more time to recollect myself..."
525292, "Lara, tell me about Grace. You know her, don't you?"
525293, "If you want to make a good impression on Grace, bring her some flowers, bread, and milk for the dead. She'll be elated and do anything for you."
525294, "I do. It's called selflessness."
525295, "It's too late to prepare. You should've started in advance. There's no point anymore..."
525296, ""
525297, "You're so skinny... Your wrists are even thinner than mine."
525298, "Do you hear the metal things clinking on my chest? Those aren't keys or lockpicks; they're a special kind of hook. Look what I've brought you, Grace."
525299, "Ah... Flowers! So beautiful, too... thank you! How did you know? Those are exactly the ones I wanted to offer Farkhad... He likes the colour red... Perhaps you're fond of them too?"
525300, "Do you really trust me just like that? Will you agree to talk to me?"
525301, "I trust you as I trust myself! I'm all ears, dear sister."
525302, "Are you afraid, Grace?"
525303, "No... but I'm afraid it is the punishment for our sins, for our faults and transgressions... Someone among us has angered the heavenly powers... It was bound to happen, with us being so brazen; so says Lady Katerina."
525304, "Exactly. I'm glad that your faith is firm. I promise you that as long as you can muster the strength to accept the divine will, nothing will hurt you."
525305, "Yours are just transparent..."
525306, "I've spoken to Grace."
525307, "And so...?"
525308, "No. I've only made her true faith firmer."
525309, "And it seemed like a better idea to me..."
525310, "I want to talk to you."
525311, "I can't, I'm busy right now... see these unburied bones? Seen that half-dug pit outside? I'm sorry, but I have a lot of things to take care of..."
525312, "I see you've got not time for me. I should've brought the charmed hook..."
525316, "So you've come because you found out we were setting up a shelter? Do you want to take part? It's strictly private, though, and I've never seen you before..."
525317, "Why? I do want to take part! Do I have to donate some money?"
525318, "...I'm not prepared to put you in charge of supplies for The House of the Living, but there is a way you can help. The Harpist has gone off to take a look at an empty house-and hasn't come back yet. If he's still there, tell him to come back here as soon as possible; I can't keep up without him. "
525319, "Just that? Your trust seems easy to earn..."
525320, "Not as easy as all that. If you do a good deed seeking no gain, it will at least be clear that you're not the shabnak-adyr. A demon cannot do good. Then I'll be able to rely on you instead of the Bachelor, who I dislike. I feel that he'll do with that money as he sees fit-we're less than human as far as he's concerned."
525321, "Won't it make him cross with me?"
525322, "It's up to you. Either you want to become a keeper of The House of the Living, or you don't. I can't spend the money anyway without the Harpist's approval."
525323, "Fine, I'll find this Harpist of yours."
525324, "No... I'm not made for errands like this, you know."
525325, "And how can I help you set up this House of the Living?"
525326, "Coming from you, this does sound like a particularly convincing promise. All right, I'll be waiting for you."
525327, "Dice? Anyway... never mind."
525328, ""
525329, "What unearthly apparition is this?"
525330, "I know very well what happens. Let's go. Lara's worried about you."
525331, ""

525333, "Go to hell... You and your jokes!"
525334, "So is the Harpist back?"
525335, "Yes. And that house, I take it, is really infected?"
525336, "So much? Thank you..."
525337, "You were found in the earth. Pulled out of a grave. So you're saying you've made your way out of the Steppe and can't remember anything now? Then I have no doubt that you're the shabnak-adyr. I've studied the legends thoroughly."
525338, "How can I prove that I'm human?"
525339, "And this threat of a plague epidemic we're facing-do you know anything about it?"
525340, "I'll certainly manage that. I just have to look a person in the eye and they become so docile... I'm a mellower of hardened hearts."
525341, "Ugh... I don't want to get involved in this!"
525345, ""
525346, "Such a pretty girl you are... Charming!"
525347, "Why are your eyes like that... as though you were going to eat me?"
525348, "The Olgimskys have been ordered to commandeer all medicine, Anna. They say you have a lot of every variety... Is it true?"
525349, "An order? And even supposing it is what the rulers have ordered... I answered to Simon alone; I've never recognized any other authority-and now, that means none! Medicine will soon be worth its weight in gold..."
525350, "How can someone like that be put in chains? And I can see that you're really sticking together in here..."
525351, "I have no reason to like this murderer... Find out if it's true. If it is, give Vlad the hint and he'll have him get down to business. Then we can get rid of that horrible Haruspex, may he curl up and die beside his alembic! Just make sure to find out if he can or he can't. We need to be certain."
525352, "All right. But how?"
525353, "He has already prepared several concoctions... That's what the Herb Bride says. You know, the naked one, that swarthy local who always gathers herbs in the Steppe... You know her? She belongs to one of the gatherers; he warms the earth for her. Let's inquire, shall we?"
525354, "All right... we'll do it your way. But you owe me one."
525355, "No, my dear... better just give up your stash. Why would you need it anyway?"
525356, "Ah, stop it! If the rumours about the disease are true, how am I to know which pills will help? I'll have to try them all."
525357, "Give them to me. I promise I'll take care of you when the time comes."
525358, ""
525359, "What is it you want, Earthdaughter?"
525361, ""
525362, "So what are you doing in this opium den? Want some hashish? Or are you waiting for this Steppe diva to fall into another of her trances and throw off the last of her rags? Are you even twelve yet?"
525363, "Let our herbs do the talking for us. How about some haggling?"
525364, "Did the Haruspex sell you any of his twyrine infusions?"
525365, "Wow... Heaven's angel here knows her controlled substances, go figure! Yeah... he did sell me some. Why are you asking?"
525366, "Show me."
525367, "No, that's not necessary. I'll handle Vlad myself."
525368, "Is that when a person comes of age here?"
525369, "I've talked to Anna. So you're saying she's been stockpiling medicine for five years, awaiting the second coming of that plague?"
525370, "Well... I think I finally know who's standing before me. I'm torn once again. My heart is begging me to offer you everlasting friendship... while my head would rather have me stay away from you."
525371, "Don't worry. Your words won't change anything. There is no one closer to you than me. Remember that."
525372, "Anna has told me something very curious about Burakh. People say that he concocts medicine himself. Perhaps it would be more productive to nudge that devil rather than the poor girl... who you're fond of, it seems?"
525373, "He doesn't concoct anything... I immedaitely tried to find out if his father has passed any of his secrets on to the son. Apparently, he did pass on some of them... but this blockhead has no notion of the true value of those recipes. Doesn't know what to do with them. It'll take him years to figure it out. Twyre requires quite a bit of understanding."
525374, "Do you need proof or something?"
525375, "Listen to me. You need medicine, right? There's a man who can make a drug to treat this disease."
525376, "Really? And who's that?"
525377, "I think your wish will be granted. Things will fall in place in no time. So, you ought to know that Burakh brought those amateurs a few of his own infusions today. Andrey says they're genuine."
525378, "Anna? Oh... It didn't work out with her. She threw me out."
525379, "Is that so? Andrey is no Peter, of course... but he's a fine expert too. Few gatherers have inhaled as much twyrine fumes as he has in the last couple of years... You deserve a reward, Clara! Don't turn it down. Your discovery will earn our family a fortune... and benefit the town greatly."
525380, "Thank you. Just try not to tell the Haruspex how you found out..."
525381, "You know... Anna's given me her entire stockpile, but I've lost it. I'm sorry."
525382, "You nasty girl! Are you trying to deceive me? Tell me you didn't sell it!  No, I don't think you'd have the wits... Handed it out to the rabble, then?"
525383, "I'm telling the truth! I have no idea how it happened either!"

525399, "I'm not going there!"

525408, "Oh, so now I'm on Saburov's list of undesirables too? Truly, I'm being targeted by all of the powers that be! I would never expect that from Saburov, a firmly principled man and an old neighbour of mine... And in the meantime, the Olgimskys have been utterly terrorizing me! I was even going to plead for his protection..."
525409, "And what's the Olgimskys' problem with you?"
525410, "Oh, and-don't believe anything they might tell you about my past, it's all lies! I came here as a refugee fleeing political persecution. For singing subversive songs..."

525416, "A fugitive actress from the Aces of Diamonds. She took up residence at the Willows and proceeded to remove the owners of that charming house from this world... A celebrity indeed. Though actually, I've never sought intimacy with her-in fact, I only remembered about her yesterday, in connection with the medicine commandeering business. Why?"
525417, "Here's what I wanted to ask: is it true that your father has been threatening this actress?"
525418, "Nothing really..."
525419, ""
525420, "Oh, all the pain, all the pity, all the abysmal depth in your eyes! Speak fast, please... I do not know why, but being close to you feels oppressive... Don't be angry with me..."
525421, "I've come to you with a very important task. If you answer my question, I won't bother you anymore for now. Tell me, is your father threatening Anna?"
525422, "A while ago all of the town's children darted for the Tower on the Other Side. Like sheep from a wolf. There was mention of the Caravan back then, but I didn't make too much of it. So Anna is afraid that her past will surface... A guilty mind is never at ease. And Khan had actually found out..."
525423, "Whatever I told you now, you wouldn't believe me. Don't be so afraid of me. You didn't think a miracle-maker would look like this, did you? That will soon pass..."
525424, "Your temples are aching, right? It's hard for me to talk to you too. But I'm not complaining..."
525425, "I've talked to the Olgimskys, Anna..."
525426, "Ah, so that's how it is... Now I understand... Now I can see the whole picture... that is the point... Now I realize... Woe is me, the ever-unlucky artiste! I've played the part of a villainess all too well, and now no one is going to believe that I am what I really am... Thank you, my dear. Now I know which direction to expect danger from."
525427, "Do you agree to answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
525428, "...They'd fed me egg yolks and oysters, made me drink lemon juice, put a special toad on my chest so that I'd absorb its miasma. It didn't work. Then they decided to make me a 'figurine'... but then there was a raid, and we got rounded up near Orv... I escaped with a snake charmer named Var... He carried me out."
525429, "And why were you the reason the pestilence broke out?"
525430, "...I had betrayed my parents. I had taken someone else's voice... someone else's hair. Then, when I was already here, I acted the same way the Caravan's leaders would... I was hungry, so I lifted all of these things from Willow the girl, who then died... It was she that used to be the golden-haired singer... That's when the plague broke out."
525431, "How is that even possible?"
525432, "...As a punishment for my greed... Willow Mellow had predicted that it would all turn out this way if the Caravan got here... She had even been stockpiling medicine; the stash is actually all hers... All this time, I've been waiting for my punishment. I've twisted my nature so badly. I should have remained a cripple..."
525433, "Too big of an honour for you, having an entire town perish because of your greed. No. It wasn't your doing."
525434, "Such injustice! You're a horrible sinner. You had it coming."
525435, "I've talked to Anna. Some neighbour you have..."
525436, "Not 'you'. 'We'. Or do you still not think of The Rod as your home? Tell me-what is your verdict on Anna?"
525437, "She is guilty."
525438, "She is innocent."
525439, "I will dispatch my men to her. She will be placed under house arrest until I have time for her."
525440, "I need to rest... All right?"
525442, "What just happened to me? Was I asleep? I've got a horrible headache..."
525443, "Never mind that."
525444, "Be watchful, Clara! Careful you don't let a criminal walk free. The entire town will be slowly consumed, while your mercy is keeping the one villain alive."
525445, "...Let truth prevail."
525446, "'The Seeds of the Caravan'"
525447, "They say that Anna Angel's soul is blacker than coal and her crimes are as terrifying as they are unprovable. Even so, I will force her to confide in me; to remove her mask and reveal the nakedness of her soul to me. It may be she is not so black on the inside."
525448, "Anna is afraid of Vlad the Heavy; the head of the Olgimsky household. He wouldn't want to meet me, that's for sure. His children though, Capella and Vlad the Younger, might trade their words with me."
525449, "I have learned a lot. Olgimsky has nothing to do with whoever is stalking Anna. I don't know if Anna should be happy about this or not. What I do know is the kind of hook I should use to drag her conscience out."
525450, "What should I do with the dreadful Anna? She is not the one to blame for the pestilence, but this doesn't make her less of a monster. Directly or not, her demented passions have led her to kill Willow Mellow. Shall I condemn her then, or shall I let her live? Father must know of my decision."
525451, "*** Guilty! The seeds of malice are sown over Anna's mysterious past and the fruit of these will be even more terrifying than the seeds themselves. Let her die. From now on, an Executor will be guarding the entrance to her house and no one will come and comfort her."

I wouldn't be surprised if the Cathedral will simply cease to exist in its capacity as a place where the aspirations of revival are kept..."

In truth, we should have started with them to begin with, though it is nearly impossible to find one these days. Most of the cows were slaughtered to prevent a famine.

There's been this special twyrine lately; it's black! And it's surrounded by so many fears and prohibitions that... there must be a reason."
525694, "Thanks for the good advice, Notkin."

525710, "Dontcha get all metaphorical on me. Although the metaphor's clear, ain't it? You're alive, so that means the plan's worked out all right. Eh? Am I right?"
525711, "I stole the severed head from Barley. And I took it to Saburov. He won't go after you today."
525712, "Heh heh... go after me? He and whose army? Or do you think he'd turn up in person, gettin' his hands all muddy 'n dirty? Like hell! Or was he gonna send you? With some stamped piece of paper? Heh heh... Oh, you thief, you!"

525731, "Father won't be seeking Bad Grief's head any more. This is good enough, but the problem of the outbreak remains unsolved... What is this black twyrine? I need to ask Bad Grief about it, and the hooks I have set into him will help."
525732, "*** Bad Grief is guilty! He knew all too well what was going to happen; yet, hoping to profit from the dangerous cargo, he did not warn anyone. This cannot be forgiven! Let him get infected, so he feels the consequences of this treachery in his own skin! From now on, an Executor will be guarding the entrance to his hovel, so no one will come to comfort him."
525733, "*** It wouldn't be fair to lay the blame on Bad Grief. True, the man has a rotten soul; selling his damned stock the way he always did... Who knows if he was even fully aware of the terror that would follow. He feels guilty, no doubt, and I can hardly think of anything more precious than when a man like this embraces repentance. I must let him live. He will be of use to me yet. "

They are the ones who have caused it, and not the poor souls my father seeks out for persecution! Why do they persist? Can't they see the truth when it is right in front of them? "
525941, "No, Peter sees it all; the truth splits in half; the world is falling. I walk upon both sides of the moonlit way, following two different paths at the same time! Do the Utopians dare mock the faith of Humility? We need to think deeper here. An immediate gain would not necessarily lead to long-term victory..."
525942, "*** What kind of a day is this? Did I do something wrong, that would cause them to change so much? Maybe I didn't accomplish much today or the day before, but then I feel these failures were not something I could avoid... My new parents must be very tired by now... I struggle to imagine how difficult this all is for them..."

525944, "It was so good of you to come... A dreadful, dreadful creature has been haunting the cemetery! It peered into my window last night. It didn't look evil to me, I should rather say it was miserable... but as soon as I saw it, I realized at once that it was Earth-spawned! It was made of clay and... and bones."
525945, "How am I supposed to meet it? Is it going to haunt you again tonight?"
525946, "It will be at the Ragi Barrow come nightfall. It's been going there for a long time-I even think it may have been born there. Perhaps it's about what's buried in the barrow... Anyway, wait for it there. But stay away from dangers!"
525947, "I'll be on my guard..."

525951, "There you are... There you are, little one... So tiny... That's because earth was in short supply... Do you know who you are?"
525952, "...Who are you? Better start out by telling me who you are!"
525953, "I am a spirit of the earth. Your brother. The Steppe bore us on the same day. "
525954, "What's that supposed to mean?"
525955, "You were born only a few days ago... You remember all that the Earth remembers... You have lied about your sister-but don't you know you cannot lie? Your sister is real now... But which of you is which? That is the question..."
525956, "Is it true that I'm the disease?"
525957, "...I can't tell. Your nature is still unclear... That's also what's making the earth unstable... you're lacking oneness... you are the void through which everything is collapsing... the firmament is no longer firm..."
525958, "How can I find my sister?"
525959, "She'll find you. Be honest. You don't need to know the truth. You have the power to make any lie true."
525960, "And who are you anyway?"
525961, "You'll find out later, if I don't get killed... Be careful. There'll be a hunt for you tomorrow... Everyone will turn against you; your protectors will disown you... Use these last hours to find provisions and shelter... And tomorrow, do whatever you're asked to do, if you want to survive."
525962, "I don't believe you. You're a mendacious spirit, just like the Rat Prophet! That one was a spawn of the earth too. You're saying this in order to destroy me."
525963, "You don't have to believe me if you don't want to. But if everything I've said comes true, spare a kind memory for me... You are flesh of my flesh, and I love you, even though you and I are only a few days old..."
525964, "How can you be a few days old if Sticky's been trying to track you down for years? You're lying."
525965, "Forget years: the town itself is barely a month old. Farewell. Remember me..."
525966, "That's impossible..."
525968, "Oi! You're one swift appearer! A child, a sweet child... Such thin, see-through palms you've got-magnificent little hands, so extraordinary... And already blackened and reddened all over. How very evocative."
525969, "What do you want from me?"
525970, "Before you enter the town and embark on your-uh-cleansing agenda, I'd like to give you a few pieces of advice. You are, after all, a mere hatchling; I rather doubt you arrived at this cemetery with your m. o. already laid out, if you pardon the pun."
525971, "Please do tell me."
525972, "Time won't wait for you. Hour after hour, day after day, it will run out fast. You're not the centre of the universe-not even now that you have this truly exceptional part to play. At some point, you may even feel that you could easily be everywhere at once... But make no mistake, the town is changing with time, and there's nothing you can do about it."
525973, "We'll see about that!"
525974, "Time has the final say in matters of life and death. It may so happen that you will knock on the door of a person you need when that person is already past being able to answer you. The news changes too... What was on a person's mind a day ago will have petered out come tomorrow. And it may have been something you'd have found useful."
525975, "Pray, why speak of such terrible things? It's not like I have a say in matters of anyone's life and death, time or no time."
525976, "Ha ha ha ha ha! Haven't had a laugh like this in quite a while. If you don't have a say, who does? Who but you, my blessed child, is holding in her hands the lives and deaths of others? But be careful with your terrible gift. Every death will count against you. No amount of trickery is too much, no price is too high for maintaining a viable reputation."
525977, "Reputation?"
525978, "Yes, you will have a reputation too, my dear child... and I don't think you'll find that sullen horse easy to tame. It will be full of surprises. Your reputation will be falling, always, relentlessly. And it's decisive in, you know, everything: how many friends you've got; how many enemies. Trust opens the right doors and the right lips."
525979, "How do I keep track of my reputation?"
525980, "People will always appreciate your help. And I can assure you a lot of people are going to need help these days. Relieving sufferers from their misery is appreciated a great deal. Sometimes a person is in such pain that even euthanasia will be a blessing-especially for the incurable."
525981, "Do I have a good reputation right now?"
525982, "Right now? Search me. But that's easy to find out. In fact it's generally a good idea not to neglect checking up on your status. Has my kind-hearted colleague spoken to you about it yet?"
525983, "He has."
525988, "Who are you? "
525989, "And who are you? That's a much more interesting question as far as everyone's concerned. Yourself included, I should think..."
525990, "You can call me Clara."
525996, "How did I end up here?"
525997, "You crawled out of a grave, sweet child. Or maybe clawed your way right out of the bowels of the earth with your fingernails. Couldn't tell from over here, the mask diminishes my field of view a bit..."
525998, "How small you are, how frail... Will you survive in this horrible world?"
525999, "You're talking as if I were a newborn baby."
526000, "Aren't you? You'll have to be taught to eat, drink, sleep, move around, heal yourself; even to breathe. This place drains your health all too fast; even a seasoned person must stay alert. Not everyone manages to cope."
526001, "Teach me, kindly Mask. How can I stay in good health?"
526002, "We're dying every minute of our lives. Thousands of cells dissolve, melt, burst like bubbles in a froth. You must replenish your strength several times a day. If you allow yourself to be overcome with exhaustion, or your hunger becomes unbearable, you will be dying even faster than usual. And usual is fast enough as it is. It's the air in this place..."
526003, "I'm hungry already. Starving, actually!"
526004, "You can buy food at a shop. If money is a problem, various comestibles can be picked up at residential houses, but those are closed except during an emergency. And should you break into one using a lockpick, be nimble; the inhabitants will defend their property."
526005, "What sort of people are they?"
526006, "You will soon learn to spot them among the populace. Their houses stand out. By the way, this is also where you can find a bed to get some replenishing sleep in-provided, of course, that you don't give the owners a reason to shut the door on you."
526007, "Where can I buy useful things around here?"
526008, "Should your reputation-on the importance of which my surly colleague has been meaning to speak to you-sink so low as to lose you the trust of even the most desperately reckless (which describes all merchants), you won't be able to buy even the most harmless of articles. But reputation can be restored."
526009, "And what if I'm injured?"
526010, "There are pharmacies selling medicine-at no small price, mind you; or you can barter for it with one of the street urchins, who carry it around out of sheer curiosity; or, if you're lucky, you may get away with pinching some from a private home. Be sure not to abuse those substances; they're bad for your system!"
526011, "What else can you teach me?"
526018, "What happened to your face?"
526019, "How can you say something like that? You haven't seen my face, it's behind the mask! Nor can I see your true face..."
526020, "You can't see my face? As if I were wearing a mask too? That's funny. Is there anything you wanted to tell me?"
526023, "'Best Friend'"
526024, "Grace told me that my best friend will meet me by the cemetery at nine in the evening. But who might that be? Grace says the two of us are very much alike. The more I think of it, the more I believe the mysterious friend is none other than Shabnak-adyr, the maneater made out of bones and clay..."
526025, "*** The creature is indeed me! Hated by everyone and all; born of some mysterious power; suffering; vulnerable. I am the epitome of everything that has befallen the town since the disappearance of Simon Kain, the suprahuman. But that also makes him the key to our salvation..."

526028, "Clara, have you heard what happened at the Cathedral?"
526029, "...Will you and Katerina love me as before? Will you not give up on me if they ask for my head?"
526030, "Who would ever demand that from us? I am the governor. The Kains are devastated by the loss of Simon. And I've just found out that the Olgimskys are equally devastated. The Termitary affair has come to light in view of the Inquisitor's arrival tomorrow. You are our heiress. You will carry on when we are no more."
526031, "Who could tell me how to approach Yulia? "
526032, "She is fond of Eva. And Eva, it seems, is fond of her. Try talking to Eva."
526033, "I'll try."

526040, "Will she agree... to answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
526041, "I think you'll be the one doing the answering. And don't try to mesmerize her. These things don't work on Yulia. She's a rationalist. Be careful not to let her trap you instead..."
526042, "I'll try."
526043, "It wasn't."
526044, ""
526045, "Yet again I am graced by your visit. A genuinely fortunate occasion."
526046, "Yulia, what happened at the Cathedral? "
526047, "Wait a minute... Is the cigarette smoke bothering you? Shall I open the window? Let us talk, Clara, let us discuss fateful invariability. Where laws of nature are concerned, Clara, you are a salient exception. But what does it suggest?"
526048, "Who was at the Cathedral? "
526049, "Do you really have to ask? The item they found in the Cathedral was my present to you. There are people who saw me give it to you, they will testify if need be."
526050, "I never took it!"
526051, "Oh but you did. Who else could it be..."
526052, "It wasn't me! I've never visited you before..."
526053, "Tell your stories to someone else, my dear, I am impervious to your chicanery. I won't surrender you to the Inquisitor, although you shouldn't go back to the Saburovs if you know what is good for you. You were proven guilty and they have used your head as a guarantee to stay their own execution. It would appear the Powers That Be didn't value their accomplishments too highly."
526054, "Confession? I don't know anything about myself either."
526055, "That's beyond question. Why else would I be so interested?"
526056, "What does the Bachelor want?"
526057, "What they all want is to gain favour with the Inquisitor arriving tomorrow. The Bachelor will not give in; he is compelled to find the carrier, whatever it takes. Having said that, if you have any part in the matter, you'd best avoid him at all costs. But if you're free of any guilt; find him before your sister does."
526058, "There is no sister. I've made her up."
526059, "Is that so? Who took my comb then; the one that was found in the Cathedral? Who took Lara's shawl and Anna's jewellery? Who plead guilty to Alexander the day before?"
526060, "But what am I to do?"
526061, "Depends on who is asking. If you are innocent, you should seek out the Bachelor before he finds you himself. Speaking of which, a corpse was found yesterday... with its heart removed. A ghastly crime indeed, but the Bachelor... he figured out an absolutely scintillating way to use it to serve his own ends. He compares the blood he took from the corpse to the other blood specimens he has collected. So, if you are guilty, you may rest assured that this is all going to end soon. If the guards were following you, they will be here any minute."
526062, "I'll go and look for him. "
526063, "Yes, it is fortunate..."
526064, "Go away! This house is henceforth no longer open to you."

526067, "...But why?"
526068, "And where is the Bachelor now? "
526069, "I'm only talking to you because Yulia has advised me to. Even though I'm very scared... Is it true that you were the shabnak-adyr all along?"
526070, "Where is the Bachelor?"
526071, "He's making rounds collecting blood samples from the suspicious women. We're very lucky to have you here! If my sweetheart catches you, he'll be saved. So here you will stay. Even if you're going to be the death of me, you're not leaving this place!"
526072, "It's not my fault! It was my twin sister! Let me go, or the Bachelor catches her and that will be the end of us all!"
526073, "I promise I'll be back."
526074, "That was utterly unconvincing. How can you prove you'll stay true to your word?"
526075, "The fact that you're still in good health should be proof enough."

526100, "I believe that. I'll introduce you to the Inquisitor tomorrow. Let her deal with you. You'll stay at Eva's place for the night. Under my surveillance. I suppose there'll be no objections?"
526101, "And what about Eva? "
526102, "Eva? Eva's disappeared. And I suspect that she's decided to turn herself in to the Inquisitor instead of you, so she could whitewash me before that hanging judge. So first thing tomorrow morning, we're going to see Karminsky, and you're telling the Inquisitor everything. Then Eva will be saved. Do you understand?"
526103, "I'd rather go and search for Eva..."
526104, "I agree!"
526105, "Do you really think I'd let you go? I'll search myself, while you stay here under lock and key."

What about Yulia, whom my father seems to hold guilty? I need to ask Eva Yan about her, to obtain the hooks that may help turn Yulia inside out..."
526111, "Something has changed! They see through me now, before I see through them. What are they talking about? Don't they love me anymore? Why do they look at me as if I were a thief soon to be unmasked? There are whispers of anxiety behind my back... I need to go to Yulia at once, she is waiting for me!"
526112, "The Bachelor would not have anything in common with a woman he considers suspicious. Yulia was right, I feel... If he finds me before I find him, it won't be me he will be talking to, but some other Clara. Clara the liar, Clara the monster, Clara guilty of everything! I need to find him and reveal myself to him; the real me, with nothing to hide."
526113, "The Bachelor is searching for the disease carrier. He seeks the messenger. He left the Earth now and went to Lara's House of the Living."
526114, "The Bachelor follows my every step. He has gone to see Aspity."
526115, "The Bachelor went home. Shall I pay him a visit? Shall I talk to him? Nothing can happen that is worse than what has already transpired..."
526116, "*** It's all over, it seems... My mind struggles to understand this. Where is the harbinger now; who is the miracle-worker? Has the Changeling changed-or has the world? Were these six days filled with lies, or was there a grain of purest truth somewhere within? Hardly worth thinking about now. No choice but to wait until morning."
526117, ""
526118, "Well... looks like it's time. Get to the Cathedral. Beware of everybody on your way; hide from every shadow. When the Inquisitor receives you, speak only the truth. Not that you'll have another option..."

526126, "What was I arrested for?"
526127, "You are being hunted, aren't you? They did, however, get a bit ahead of themselves there... At least they should've announced you to the Inquisitor. Well... the good goons went out of their way to be useful. They had failed to catch the maneater back when they reported to Saburov, so they went for something quick and dirty this time..."
526128, "What can I do to keep my cover?"
526129, "Whatever. Stop pestering me. Although... I reckon the Inquisitor wouldn't mind talking to you-but until you've made your introduction, it's best to remain incognito."
526130, "You know what? Give me your costume!"
526131, "No... There's no way I'm giving you mine. But I can tell you where to find another one like it. When Executors' cloaks become infected, they get dumped next to the large burial pit in Earth."

526145, "I'll make up my mind by this evening, and that's if I like you. For now, you'll do what I tell you to. I'd like to see you alter the fabric of creation-or more exactly, I'd like to convince myself that you can do nothing of the sort; that you're a mere changeling rather than someone who incites the change."
526146, "...What does that mean?"
526147, "You'll begin with the Saburovs. Do to them what they made you do to their subjects! Ask them. Find out how guilty they themselves think they are. True culprits are better than others at avoiding taking responsibility."

526156, "The Bachelor won't be at home. He's searching for undercover agents-another thought-provoking detail, by the way-he's searching for undercover agents of the Powers That Be to turn over to the Inquisitor for execution. They've been hiding behind Executors' masks."

526193, "Katerina has asked me to tell you that she's abdicating from her throne as a Mistress."
526194, "Don't celebrate just yet. This town has another Mistress in the making. She may be a mere tot now, but I'm already more inclined to reckon with her than with you! Ask Capella the same thing you asked me. Ask her who Victoria wants to see replace Katerina."
526195, "I'll do just that."
526196, "Nothing."
526197, ""
526198, "Even your eyes keep changing colours..."
526199, "Tell me, you do speak with your mother, don't you? Maria is asking who Victoria would like to see as... the new Mistress."
526200, "No. But mom did hint that owing to you, Simon survives and is regaining life. Do you hear me? This means Katerina must name you as her successor. Is she relinquishing power?"
526201, "She won't make that mistake. I can vouch for that."
526202, "Whatever the colour, they still see that you don't trust me..."
526203, "I'm back, Katerina. I've asked about the Mistress-to-be."
526204, "It is... I know it for sure now. I lied... and was lied to. This Rat Prophet, the creature from my dreams, was the spawn of my lies. So there, I have betrayed everyone's trust. I must go."
526205, "I don't need that at all!"
526206, "I believe in you. Saving people is your calling. Yes, you've been a bringer of death... But isn't it true that sometimes to save is to release? For this world, healing is death. Such is the logic of the Law. The disease is treating the sore upon the world. You are a Mistress. Have no doubt of that. Rule wisely. And farewell."
526207, "I'll tell the Inquisitor of what I've heard here."
526208, "I've fulfilled the task you gave me."
526209, "My dear child... No matter what you did, I would draw the correct conclusions. No one's taken your freedom away from you. You can refuse if you like; you can attempt to escape. And even if you succeed at it, it won't mean my defeat. All I want is to understand your role in this world."
526210, "I don't quite understand..."
526211, "So here's my first question. What's to be done about the Saburovs? This doll-house family that has been audacious enough to think they can rule over a human settlement as it's experiencing its ultimate catastrophe? A family whose actions have led to the deaths of several thousand people?"
526212, "Let them perish. They deserve it."
526213, "No! Just don't do anything to them. They are so unhappy! And it's not their fault..."
526214, "The Executors did their work here, no doubt. This is where they brought their gruesome harvest. Perhaps some of them even died here tonight..."
526215, "'Vengeance'"
526216, "Who would have thought that I would return to this house as a harbinger... and a judge! Everything is head over heels. Fate plays with us in mischievous ways."
526217, "Who could tell me where exactly the Bachelor is searching for the Executors? He must have visited the Theatre... They will know where he went."
526218, "Even more victims to suffer under the sword of this merciless demon. He stalks them, approaching secretly, as if he were one of their own... This horrible mask would fit him well. It's as though it were created just for him! I will bring it to him!"
526219, "Burakh is on to some dirty work in the Termitary. With the number of dead bodies in there, I'm sure he is thriving. However, he knows something about the Inquisitor, something even the Bachelor is oblivious of. I need to find him."
526220, "Birds of a feather... Burakh has donned the garb of a death messenger as well. Everything has hastened towards its most logical outcome! I hope it concerns me too, even though I will surely come out better than them all!"
526221, "I know everything now. I can return to my father now, he is waiting in the Rod."
526222, "The hardest is yet to come. What is Katerina going to say to me? Can I still call her mother after she has rejected me?"
526223, "Once again I have to visit Maria. I am no longer afraid, for I feel that her and Capella are soon to become the only ones alive who will share in my all-encompassing loneliness. Or was an end such as this chosen by Katerina? I wouldn't know."
526224, "It's time to see Capella. I wouldn't say I didn't see it coming. Sooner or later, everything comes to a head... Is it too late now to step away from this path? For me it is. The road goes all the way downhill and I am moving at such a speed that were I to stop, I would break apart."
526225, "How unexpected... It was but a moment ago that I trembled in anticipation of Capella's decision... I was afraid I would have to wear this fearsome crown. But I am no longer afraid! She told me something that halted my descent. I am at the crossroads again."
526226, "There, now I saw them. I never expected to see anything of this kind in the Rod. What am I going to say to Aglaya? I should make a decision on my way to the Cathedral."
526227, "*** So be it. They are guilty. They have surrendered me to the slaughter, but this is not the cause of their guilt. They are guilty of being possessed by evil; guilty of causing harm to the place they lived; guilty of seducing the others with their false truths and guilty of condemning those who deserved nothing but to be forgiven. There is no way back for them and no one will comfort them..."
526228, "*** They are not guilty, even if it was them who surrendered me to the slaughter. Even though they were possessed by evil; caused great harm to the place they lived; seduced the others with their false truths and condemned those who deserved to be forgiven. For all this, I will not be their judge. I will try to redress what they have done."
526229, "Dear me... And what was I doing in there?"
526230, "And why are you standing here with these horrible masks on your faces... Has something happened?"
526231, "I'll figure it out, beakhead! Go away and don't bother me anymore."
526232, "Why do you need to rub it in?"
526233, "He hasn't."
526234, "Most importantly, don't forget to stop by the caretaker's lodge. You've got people awaiting you there, and they have no doubts about your identity. As it happens, they've just drawn proof of your arrival from a pile of oracle bones... Your turning up in person will duly impress them. Tarry not."
526235, "Careful! Don't scratch me with that beak of yours."
526236, "It is no beak, my dear child. It is a talon! For what I really am is a finger-of a hand!"
526237, "You should be that much more careful if it's a talon."
526238, "I'll remember to do that, kindly teacher. Thank you..."
526239, "Me? I'm not much of a teacher... More like your faithful servant. I'm here because of you, you know. It's you who are the kindly teacher."
526240, "As you wish."
526241, "Essentially, this is it for now. Don't forget to stop by the caretaker's lodge. Awaiting you there is Katerina, who will be a better mentor and support than myself in these difficult first days. You're lucky to have her on your side-being as she is a Mistress, as well as wife to our ruler, the fearsome Alexander."
526242, "Very lucky indeed!"
526243, "I don't need your advice. I think I'm familiar with eating. You open your mouth and go 'nom.'"
526244, "I'm so tired, it's as if I've been sleepwalking all night..."
526245, "So what am I to do?"
526246, "You can take anything you want at the mansions of those destined for the leading roles in this unfolding drama: such is the custom of hospitality with the local aristocracy and those who try to imitate them."
526247, "You can spot a shop by its sign. They're for selling useless items as well as buying useful ones. And some of the people in the street will gladly barter things they wouldn't sell you for money. There's illicit trade going on at a couple of secret spots-but a lady so young would be wise not to set foot in those dens. Or, for that matter, talk about them."
526248, "So there are things no one would sell me, right?"
526249, "Pinching? As in stealing? Won't they give me some if I ask politely?"
526250, "Thank you, Mask. I don't need you anymore."
526251, "Do you recognize me, Katerina? I recognized you at once."
526252, "My wife Katerina said you had been seen at the cemetery. The late caretaker's daughter claims that you had crawled out of a fresh grave, the appearance of which could not be accounted for. Is this true?"
526253, "Yes. I awoke in an earthen pit. It didn't look like a grave. Just a pit in the middle of a cemetery... But that's not a crime, is it?"
526254, "What? How could she possibly have talked to you already?"
526255, "At least half of what you've said is true."
526256, "So you're the cemetery caretaker. Don't worry, I won't do you any harm."
526257, "My, you're so pretty! What's your name?"
526259, "Anna. Anna Angel. When I was small, it's what they called me for my beautiful singing voice. And what's your name?"
526260, "My name is Clara. Don't be scared of me."
526261, "Clara. I didn't get any nicknames when I was a child, because I couldn't sing at all."
526262, "...You do look like a regular human being on the outside."
526263, "There's so much anguish in your eyes, so much pain..."
526264, "I'd like to help-if my help is needed here, of course... I can work miracles."
526265, "That's not uncommon around here. And do you know that a person greatly resembling you in appearance is wanted for murder committed by supernatural means?"
526266, "I'm not who you're looking for. See, I've even come to you of my own accord..."
526267, "I do. But don't be in a hurry to call the guards. I'm not guilty, and there's proof of that!"
526268, "So it must be my twin sister. I've followed her into this town."
526269, "Perhaps you've seen my sister? We look exactly like each other."
526270, "I know who you are. I just can't quite get a grasp of your essence. Where people have a soul, you have a black pit. What name have you chosen for yourself?"
526271, "Why are you saying such hurtful things? What have I ever done to you?"
526272, "I've chosen the name Clara. Same as my sister's."
526273, "I've come from the Steppe."
526274, "Fine sister you've got... More of a menace than any caravan. Few people could hope to cause such a commotion."
526275, "The worst thing is, we're twins..."
526276, "I'm Clara. And you?"
526277, "You'd have missed..."
526278, "On suspicion of murdering Simon Kain, an immortal man. Did you know him? Speak!"
526279, "Immortal Simon... Sometimes I think I did... I don't understand anything!"
526280, "No. I didn't know him."
526281, "I am Bachelor Dankovsky. Bear in mind that I'm indebted to the person whose death has made my life meaningless. And if I find out you were involved, I'll make short work of you."
526282, "I had nothing to do with it."
526283, "Have pity... I'm frightened enough as it is."
526284, "Let it be Clara. I've come to this town... looking for my sister. Yes, I'm looking for my sister. Something's telling me she has recently paid you a visit."
526285, "Go, I will follow. Perhaps I will be at The Rod even before you get there."
526286, "You won't... I move very quickly."
526287, "And how will I find your house?"
526288, "No, it's not clay."
526289, "The Rod is in the Tanners district. It stands upon a cape, where the Gullet flows into the Gorkhon. Head north-west and don't cross any bridges. You can tell our house by the tall tower."
526290, "I'll find it."
526291, "Yes, that is right... I have been waiting for you... Clara. We have many things to talk about."
526292, "Ask me and I will answer."
526293, "And why have you been waiting for me? Please do tell me!"
526296, "Are you in danger?"
526297, "Yes. The bones say we are in a danger the likes of which have not been seen on this earth. Go to our house, Clara. If you are who we have been waiting for, you will have no trouble getting there, and no-one will threaten you on your way."
526298, "And what are they saying?"
526299, "They're saying they've already vacated seven of the nine corners of their house for the guests that are due. All of the house's inhabitants are now crammed into the remaining two corners. Can you imagine the harvest that death is about to reap?"
526300, "Are those their bones you've got before you?"
526301, "No. These bones belong to the children of Suok. Legend says that a shard of Bos Turokh's rib is hidden among them, but no one knows which exact bone is his. With these bones, we draw the lines that carry words from the house of the dead."
526302, "What words have the dead chosen this time?"
526303, "Oh, scary... I can picture vividly this house with the dead crowded in those corners, expecting the many guests..."
526304, "And my lady doesn't want to believe it! She says the future can be changed. This is her pity talking... Where did you come from? I thought you were going to stay at Grandfather's-you only went there yesterday evening, after all..."
526305, "Shhh! Be quiet! I don't know anything about a Grandfather... Got it?"
526306, "Have you seen her with your own eyes?"
526307, "Just like I'm seeing you now."
526308, "You're making it up. I'm the only me in this world."
526309, "It must have been my sister."
526310, "Who was that scary man?"
526311, "He is of Warden stock; he knows the lines of the body. He can heal people and is allowed to cut a body. He said his name was Artemy Burakh. But I'm afraid he'll kill the wounded man instead of healing him... The workman was, after all, his enemy; he'd attacked Burakh in the morning and injured him."
526312, "And where is this Burakh's den?"
526313, "I don't know, but I think it must be nearby. He was in a bad state himself, so he couldn't have walked too far with a limp body on his hands. Hiding at the Works perhaps? Or at the runaway hospice... But now that I think of it, his shoes were covered in grey clay, which you only get around the Works."
526315, "Why, then, are you being called a thief? I do believe larcenous skills are the exclusive domain of the wicked."
526316, "It's actually the other way round! My hands have the gift of healing. I can cure the most terrible diseases with my hands. I've cured cancer. I even brought someone back from the dead once. Everyone said I'd made a miracle happen."
526317, "Indeed... You are a miracle-worker. That makes you almost a saint. Yes, a status like that precludes accusations of murder and theft. But then explain to me the meaning of those coincidences! If not for my blind faith in my wife's words, I would have no doubt that you are an evil spirit, a spawn of the netherworld. And if you don't explain that mystery at once-I swear even Katerina's influence will not save you!"
526318, "Wait! I'll tell you. I have a twin sister. She looks exactly like me, is named the same, and wears the same clothes! I fear that she was the one who committed all those horrible crimes..."
526319, "...All right. Have it your way. I accept this explanation, and I believe you."
526320, "Thank you for believing me."
526321, "So what are you capable of, Clara? Tell me more about your miraculous abilities."
526322, "I can cure various diseases using my hands."
526323, "I know that already. Anything else?"
526324, "I don't understand such things... Who are these people?"
526325, "The Kains are the family with which everything began here. Their radiant blood has preserved the memory of ancient magic since the time of the epics. They are the descendants of heroes who had fashioned the world out of their own flesh, who had created talking beasts and stretched chains of fire from sea to sea and built sky-high towers in a single night..."
526326, "Why are you telling me all this?"
526327, "The town is now governed by the Saburov-Olgimsky-Kain triumvirate. I fear that driven by their desire to avenge Simon, the Kains could try to shift the balance of power. Their tyranny would usher in an era of madness. I don't want that to happen. But I need to be sure before I can confront the Kains. And that is where you can help me."
526328, "It wasn't me! Look into my eyes... Do you believe me?"
526329, "...I don't know why, but for some reason I trust you. I get this strange feeling as though I have known you for a long time. And that makes me suspicious, Clara-pointing as it does to the fact that you control an otherworldly power of some kind."
526330, "I do have inexplicable powers! I've always had them. But I've always thought of it as a blessing. It's good, not evil..."
526332, "Who's been murdered? I know nothing."
526333, "Simon Kain. The oldest and wisest of us. The spiritual mentor and founder of our community. Don't dodge the question. The charge is serious. But for my wife's firm faith in you, I would have handed you over to the Kains without a moment's hesitation."
526334, "And you? Do you suspect me too?"
526335, "I can't help myself. What if it's the force of truth? The truth speaking for itself?"
526336, "Who's calling me a thief?"
526337, "That is something you'll have to ask my wife. She, too, possesses mysterious powers. Specifically, she has prophetic dreams. It has been proven over many years that these dreams do come true. They have been her main source of knowledge about you."
526340, "(... I've just had to tell a lie for the first time in my life... to invent a fictional sister and shift all those outrageous accusations to her... strange I could even utter the words... but I promise, I promise when it all clears up I'll explain myself and undo that lie...)"
526341, "The criminal...?"
526342, "The head of one of the ruling families died last night. His murderer is said to be a woman similar to you in appearance. The description largely matches. The common folk, blinded by local superstitions, are blaming a mystical creature spawned by the earth under mysterious circumstances at night. Is there anything you have to say to that, Clara?"
526343, "How?"
526344, "You will go to The Crucible. It is in the upper part of town, called the Stone Yard. Go to Georgiy, charm him with your hypnotic powers, and find out what's behind Simon's death. It's a dangerous mission, but an important one. If you succeed, I will reward you generously, Clara."
526345, "Yes, that's right. I ask directly if they consent, and their mind approaches mine only if they say yes. Also I must know the person's real name and a secret fact from their life."
526346, "You do, however, need more than just to look into a person's eyes in order to make them speak the truth and answer your every question? You need their consent?"
526347, "You don't trust your wife?"
526348, "I would rely on Katerina's testimony entirely if I were a common man instead of one of the town's rulers and an heir to a family that has maintained order in this land for generations! Several thousand lives are my direct responsibility. Do you understand?"
526349, "I'm ready. I have nothing to worry about."
526350, "I have received reports of a fight at the Station this morning. Several men were killed, several more maimed. I have dispatched two loyal men there. They will tell you where the dead and wounded have been carried off. See if anything can be done."
526351, "Fancy running into you here! That's lucky. You did come here out of compassion, right? Do me a favour and run a little errand for me. I'll pay you most generously."
526352, "What errand?"
526353, "You see, there was an... accident yesterday. A most esteemed gatherer-one of those half-human freaks, you know-lost his pretty young wife... to the deftness of our good friend the Haruspex."
526354, "All right. Give me the weapon. Anything for the Ripper!"
526355, "I have to think it over. I don't like the way you're grinning as you wax poetic about moral obligations..."
526356, "All right, give me the damn thing... I'll deliver it."
526357, "Thank you, Clara. Please understand, some things can't be avoided. Your participation or lack thereof will not change anything. And ultimately, it will all turn out for the better."
526358, "You're telling this to me? You're funny..."
526359, ""
526360, "Boddho's vein is getting colder. Mother Suok is covering us with her skin."
526361, "The Bachelor asked me to give this to you. You did want a weapon, right?"
526362, "Thank you! Have some blades. Good tight blades they are, see those gnarly white roots, them's the proper stuff. Make yourself some twyrine. Sweet. Thick. Smoky."
526363, "I don't really know if I should..."
526364, "Don't despair. Your wife sheds starry tears over you from the sky every night."
526365, "Well, I've given the weapon to that bogey."
526366, "Good! Fortunate in every respect. That weapon keeps jamming anyway, and it's next to impossible to fire it and hit anything. So I suppose everyone will be contented in the end. What did he say?"
526367, "I could use some."
526368, "'The Haruspex Will Sow a Seed of Malice'"
526369, "The demons are grinding their teeth at each other! The Bachelor wishes the Haruspex killed. He asked me to give a weapon to the Worm whom the Haruspex mistreated."
526370, "It is all done. I must go back to the Bachelor."
526371, "*** If only they killed one another sooner! The time comes when both of them will cause their greatest evil, and pull my true fate away from me."
526372, "Here nests the sad Worm whom the Bachelor promised to help."
526373, "Ah! Help me out, will you, Clara?"
526374, "I'll probably have to, one way or another..."
526375, "I've promised to help a certain poor family. They gave me shelter once. Now I want to correct at least some of the wrongs inflicted upon them by the Bachelor."
526376, "All right. Give me the vials."
526377, "Oh no... Insist all you like, I'm not going there."
526378, "All right. I'll go there. Even though I'm pressed for time... Did you say they were waiting for you at your house?"

Wanted more, but the next night their place got boarded up."

526424, "I'll tell you the one about how the one-eyed, one-handed, one-legged Night's Daughter counted her cattle."
526425, "Awesome. And the rest?"
526426, "You'll hear the rest when I'm back from the Abattoir. So it's in your best interest to also tell me how to fight the Foreman."
526427, "There's no use fighting him. But I'll give you a good advice. He's worried a lot on account of Young Burakh's arrival. Perhaps he'll let you go in one piece if you manage to capture his interest like you did with me. Go through the Gates of Labour. It's in between our buildings."
526428, "Thank you, little Taya."

526430, "What do you want, Earth?"
526431, "Will you agree to answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
526432, "No."

526434, "What can you tell me?"
526435, "How your standoff is going to end."
526436, "Good. I want to make certain that he is who he claims to be. Perhaps there is no reason to take it slow at all."
526437, "All right."
526438, "I sense neither warmth nor blood in you."
526439, "Yet you ought to respect me, Foreman Oyun."
526440, ""
526441, "And yet you and I are two of a kind. Fine, you win... I'm not going to bite anymore."
526442, "Tell me about Burakh, Aspity."
526443, "What is there to tell you about him?"
526444, "You sprang from the Earth, then?"
526445, "Yes, same as you."
526446, "And to what end?"
526447, "I don't know. But I sense that it's to carry out the will of the Law... to destroy the accursed utopia. A place that is not... and must never be."
526448, "Don't you tell anyone about this conversation."
526449, "You do that!"
526450, "I've seen Aspity."
526451, "Is she alive?"
526452, "Yes, she's alive."
526453, "...I will answer then-a single question of yours. That gleam in your eye is unneeded. I will not lie. Conserve your strength. What did you want to know?"
526454, "Are you guilty of starting this plague?"
526455, "What do you intend to do with Burakh?"
526456, "Yes. It was me. I had failed to perform the rite. I knew beforehand that the lines of Bos Primigenius were outside my grasp. I have lied and am now doomed to die. I am not a worthy Warden."
526457, "That is all."
526458, "I will kill Burakh unless I conclude that it is he who must kill me. If I am assured of his worthiness and my lack thereof, I will fall. I will put up a mere appearance of a fight, for a new Warden must defeat the old one in battle."
526459, "Now I have heard your answer."
526460, "I've seen the Foreman."
526461, "So what did he tell you about Burakh?"
526462, "We'll see... Maybe I will, maybe I won't..."
526463, "'The Town; Its Entrails'"
526464, "She acts as if she were conducting a chemical experiment! First she has tested whether I mix well with people, now she is curious if I mix well with the town itself! Aglaya seems to think that the town is formed by three major substances, and I am going to start with the one at the very bottom! The road to the Abattoir has to pass through the Termitary."
526465, "However peculiar the gatekeeper that guards the passage into the Abattoir, the way of getting past is same as ever. What kind of a fairy tale shall I humour her with? Which would she like the most? I don't have any hooks to unpick her yet... A boy named Sticky can help me with this."
526466, "I can go back to the Mother Superior now. I hope I won't forget my fairytale on the way."
526467, "The passage will be open. The mouth of the Abattoir is agape. The monster is waiting inside, the minotaur Foreman. He will have the answers to my questions."
526468, "The scythe was held over her head once before and yet here she stands; blocking my path! Is she a spirit, or could she be the Thing from the Steppe?  Regardless, she will know the answers to my questions, for her mouth is filled with earth."
526469, "I can return to the worried Foreman, and in doing so make him worry even more. Burakh is destined to confront him and it's an easy guess as to who is going to come out on top... The Foreman is strong, but would he be able to pull off this feat? I doubt it; I am the only miracle-maker here."

526471, "*** I can see what is happening to the Kin, I know what goes on in Earth. It's perfectly clear to me now that the Fiery Demon Haruspex is sitting atop the Abattoir, preparing to swallow it whole and bring the surrounding parts of the town under his rule. If there is any living substance within, it will have to submit to his will."

Believe it or not, but the timing of your visit is impeccable, for while we've been trying to salvage what little has been left to us by our dearest brother, we've come close to solving the mystery of Simon's transformation. Would you be willing to do us a very important favour?"
526484, "Will you answer my questions if I do?"
526485, "Yes. And we'll let you inside the Tower. That is what you've come for, isn't it?"

526487, "We'd like you to go to the Termitary and find doctor Rubin, who is hiding from our wrath there. Tell him he's been forgiven. Let him come here. Together, perhaps, you could find out what happened to Simon's blood."
526488, "What happened to it? I don't understand..."
526489, "There is none."

526494, "Where?"
526495, "That's just what I wanted to ask you about. I've tracked down some of the commoners you had cured: their cells were mutated, but they hadn't become immune."
526496, "This is thrilling news... I don't know what to say."
526497, "There was no need..."
526498, ""
526499, "I'm past being surprised to see you again at this point."
526500, "Goodbye."
526501, "Tell me, Burakh, where did Rubin get blood that was similar to Simon's?"
526502, "Do you know who the Bound are?"
526503, "Yes, I do."
526504, "I've found out curious things about myself..."
526505, "We need the Polyhedron to become flesh for Simon's spirit. But a harrowing decision like this will come at a terrible price: we will have to say a final farewell to Nina, whose spirit resides there at the moment."
526506, "That's impossible."
526507, "The Polyhedron can work miracles. It exists in defiance of all laws, imaginable and otherwise. It's a miracle made real, the pinnacle of our legacy. The Utopia in the flesh. If it's destroyed, it will be lost for good. Nothing like it will ever be known to history."
526508, "Why?"
526509, "It is capable of capturing a miracle. It captures the soul. It captures childhood. It feels like a world of eternal bliss to children who dwell within it. That's why they've set up their own republic there. And now it's your turn to speak. What was that blood the Bachelor was talking about?"
526510, "This scares me... I don't understand a thing... these destroyers, the Haruspex and the Bachelor, say that I was involved in the creation of that blood."
526511, "If you and Rubin find the origin of the blood that holds a likeness to that of Simon's, then perhaps we may avoid having to banish Nina. It isn't Simon himself that we need-but the power of creation he wields. We live for its sake. Simon is not the Polyhedron's purpose; rather, Simon's purpose was to allow such Polyhedrons to spring up in this world."
526512, "I'd like to convince myself personally."
526519, ""
526520, ""
526521, "...So it's all about trickery to you? Wherever have you come from?"
526522, "Fains I!"
526523, "Now that's a surprise. Well then, come in. Do you wish to join us? Now of all times, when they've just rolled in that cannon? The mere sight of it would be enough to tear down five towns like ours. You astonish me."
526524, "I'm not sure you're aware that I'm friends with Notkin."
526525, "No, I detest trickery."
526526, "But it could be dangerous!"
526527, "If you are truly the prophecied messenger from above, you have nothing to fear. Nothing will harm you. The murderer has fled. The whole town is searching for them. Wherever they are now, that place is far from the Station. Go and fear nothing."
526528, "Yes, I do."
526529, "And what if I don't succeed this time? After all, I can't control this power. It's coming from beyond."
526530, "If not this time, then another time. Heal a man by nightfall for me-in the presence of a witness, or preferably witnesses. This will strengthen our position. I will then have legitimate grounds for protecting you against the Kains' wrath."
526531, "You don't think my sister's guilty of this crime too?"
526532, "I have no idea what kind of a person your sister is and what her talents are. But it isn't likely. Even if your sister is as singular a creature as yourself, that carried the wrong signature. It was the work of a true ripper."
526533, "And if the wounded man dies before I get to him?"
526534, "So now you have trust in me?"
526535, "I trusted you even before that. Do not be offended by these tests. What I do, I do not on my own behalf, but on behalf of the people entrusted to my care. I will most likely give you one more task; just allow me to pause and compose my mind first: I am considering what would be the best approach to the matter."
526537, "Such arts are pertinent to demons, not humans-or rather, to half-human sorcerers who are part beast or part malicious element!"
526538, "I never said they were like that. I said they had descended from such... beings. It was a figure of speech. The Kains are every bit as human as the Saburovs. And yet there is still within them a spark of the flame that burned in deities and heroes born into a mythical era."
526539, "Why have you brought them up?"
526540, "But you are a ruler. Why do you speak of the Kains as though they were more powerful than you?"
526547, "Well then... Go to Katerina. She will tell you about Georgiy. You are not, indeed, as simple as you seem. It is strange that you have revealed your secret to me. Have you not been tempted to use your skills on me?"
526548, "Why would I? You're helping me. So I have nothing to hide from you."
526549, "I haven't revealed anything to you. I've just explained why I can't deceive you, so that you could trust me. I'll go to Katerina."
526550, "You do, however, need more than just to look into a person's eyes in order to make them speak the truth and answer your every question? You need their consent?"
526561, "Have you heard the news about the plague already? The Bachelor has found the real murderer. An epidemic is spreading in the town. I feel the Kains will not be happy with this turn of events. So tell me one thing: did Georgiy know what his brother and patron died of?"
526562, "No. He's convinced that no natural cause could've possibly ended his brother's life. He's sure there is a murderer-however indirect their methods may be."
526563, "I see. Sounds typical of him... Here's what all of it means: I am going to talk to the Bachelor. Now that the murderer has been found, no one will dare continue the search for the maneater... for a while. But the Kains will not abandon their version so easily. And there's another danger-the mob."
526564, "A danger to whom?"
526565, "I suppose she is!"
526566, "It is possible, is it not, that she was the one who brought the disease into our town? Would you like to look for her?"
526567, "Maybe she is, maybe she isn't..."
526568, "I'll devote all of my time to this!"
526569, "You mean all of your spare time. Do you not realize how precarious your position is still? You have been cleared in my eyes, but people, both the commoners and the Bound, will require other evidence."
526570, "That was just an introduction... You do have something important to tell me, right?"
526571, "The visions-they're not all the same. Some of them are clear, some are hazy. But a recent one was straightforward and vivid-a vision of such power that even a materialist would not question its divine provenience. I've had a vision of the chaos to come. Of the doom of all our creations. Of the earth swallowing our town."
526572, "If it's all true, it's horrible..."
526573, "Yes, yes... That is correct. All that remains is to interpret that dream. A dream is always an allegory. Before I saw you, before I heard you speak, I had been thinking of other pairs of twins: Simon and Georgiy Kain, Andrey and Peter Stamatin... Even those visitors, the Haruspex and the Bachelor, had seemed to be the harbingers from my dream... But now I see where the truth lies."
526574, "So you believe me?"
526576, "Now look here. Since you are holding the threads of life in your wondrous hands, I am going to entrust you with several people. They are all wicked people. Their souls are as black as soot. Each one of them is either an avowed evildoer, or hiding a sinister secret. You must take care of them."
526577, "Agreed... If I'm able to do it, that is."
526578, "And now hear me. All that I have told you is between you and I alone. Don't say a word about anything. Most importantly, keep it from my husband."
526579, "I thought you had no secrets from each other..."
526580, "He is not his own master. He is a ruler. A man of duty. Two men are living inside him. It will drive him insane to find out that I have charged you with taking care of those who his duty dictates that he should suspect, indict, and execute. He trusts my premonitions too much."
526581, "But what am I to do then?"
526582, "I am fully convinced that the prophecy was referring to you. But others will need better proof than that. Do as my husband said and prove that you are who I think you are... and we will stand by you. The ruling couple and the holy harbinger."
526583, "What does that mean?"
526584, "It means that if you stand before our people in all your glory, fulfil your destiny, and don't abandon us afterwards, we will adopt you as our daughter. When I die, I will pass on to you the power of the Spirit. And your heart's chosen one will inherit the power of the Sword from my husband."
526585, "I don't understand. Taking care of evildoers?"
526586, "If you are a kind angel, a holy miracle-worker sent to us from heaven, who else but you could discern some virtue inside their lost souls, convert them, redeem them, forgive them? But that is not the reason I am asking you to take care of them. There are many in our town who need to be purified. There are many worse villains than these. And yet these ones are special. Special to you, Clara..."
526587, "Why?"
526588, "Trust me. I know. I can see into the future. The sinners who I will now name will be of use to you in due time. In what way, I know not-but I know that they will be. The likelihood is fairly great... So make sure that they live-unless you should yourself see it more fit that they die. Is this agreed?"
526589, "Yes. I'll grant life to those who deserve to live. And I'll be the doom of those who must die..."
526590, "I want to serve both of you equally."
526591, "You can never misstep, for every action you take is governed by supreme justice. Decide as your nature tells you. Listen to your feelings."
526592, "All right. Have it your way."
526593, "I can't promise you anything, but I'll be mindful of your request. May I have a look at them?"
526595, "I would call a person by their real name twice and say the words, 'Such-and-such, I know of you this... Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?' If the answer's yes, then it's done."
526598, "Why 'I know of you this'? It feels like a part of the phrase is omitted..."
526599, "It is! You really have to know a secret about the person, which it would stun them to hear. But the secret must be true, of course. For example, you can say: 'Anna, oh Anna, I know of you this: you've kidnapped a child!'"
526600, "What is that supposed to mean? Why did you say that?"
526601, "That's just an example. Do you know any secrets concerning Georgiy Kain?"
526605, "Yes, I will teach you... First of all, call him Judge. Do not call him Georgiy at first. The Kains are clever and he may immediately become suspicious. If you want to stun him with a secret... try to say, 'You never loved Simon, and you are no twin of his.' He will be taken aback."
526606, "Thank you. Thank you!"
526610, "What for?"
526611, "That's how I unlock a soul."
526613, "Yes, that's right. I ask directly if they consent, and their mind approaches mine only if they say yes. Also I must know the person's real name and a secret fact from their life."
526614, "What for?"
526615, "That's how I unlock a soul."
526616, "Well then... Go to Katerina. She will tell you about Georgiy. You are not, indeed, as simple as you seem. It is strange that you have revealed your secret to me. Have you not been tempted to use your skills on me?"
526619, "But why would he give you so difficult a task, my child? He is well aware that the Kains, blinded by fury, are looking for the mysterious maneater who supposedly murdered Simon... In their anger, they are missing the obvious-but such is that family's way... Even our protection may be of no use!"
526620, "The truth will speak for itself. They won't dare hurt me... I suppose."
526621, "Perhaps. But Georgiy will never speak to you, will he? Or do you wield such power over people as to be able to make him talk?"
526622, "No, I have no such power. But cunning will become the solution where power can't. If you help me, I can make him answer questions."
526623, "I'm under protection of a power that will make any ruler's army beat a retreat."
526625, "Who are Mistresses?"
526626, "There was a time when the head of each of the three families brought into his house a woman of supernatural powers. The first one was Victor Kain, Simon and Georgiy's brother. He had lived in the Capital when he was very young. Matters concerning the running of his estate had been the pretext for his leaving, but in truth, he was attracted by something entirely different..."
526627, "Namely?"
526628, "I'm not in a position to tell you at this point. Because of the connections he had made in those circles, he became acquainted with one Nina Lilich. A bright, refined, devilish artistocrat who fell for Victor for some reason, and he brought her here, in this faraway corner of the Steppe."
526629, "And what happened then? "
526630, "It turned out then that Nina was harbouring plans concerning this place... And the Kains' elders, Georgiy and Simon, had certainly impressed her... To put it briefly, Nina became the ruler of this land. I was only-what?-fifteen at the time... Yes, Nina died eleven years ago."
526631, "Where did her power lie?"
526632, "It is impossible to describe. It is beyond the mind to grasp. She emanated a demonic passion. She inspired those around her and radiated the faith in the limitlessness of human capacities. Those who were near her were blinded by that faith... She was the source of many a horrific and brilliant idea. Then Victoria came along."
526633, "Was she like that too?"
526634, "No, she was completely different. For Nina, human lives were tools, while Victoria protected them. I think that was why Big Vlad Olgimsky had brought her here. He had married her a long time ago... but she and their son, Vlad the Younger, who was very small at the time, used to live far away, somewhere in the eastern region..."
526635, "Is she dead too?"
526636, "She is. Mysteriously, they are both survived by daughters... Nina bore Maria, and Victoria had little Victoria who our children call Capella. Both girls were orphaned at an early age... and each grew up to manifest the abilities. There is a young Mistress growing up in each of the families."
526637, "...So you have a daughter too? You're also... like that, aren't you?"
526638, "And what happened then? When did she come here?"
526639, "Each of the three families has been professing its own version of truth for many generations. Each family has embodied the power of a certain colour... and each is trying to refashion the world in its own likeness. It is good that the antagonism between the families prevents any single power from gaining the upper hand. We are building the town together, all of us, and we are building it through opposing each other."
526642, "And what about the Mistresses? Nina and Victoria?"
526643, "Yes, their conflict had raged over the town for a long time-peaceful, invisible to the ordinary people, but no less furious for it. Nina was striving to get to a place where no human being is allowed, and dragging her followers along, believing that her goal justified their suffering. Victoria protected the people from her, sculpted the very flesh of the town-for as long as she was alive."
526644, "The third one, the youngest Mistress in the town, and the only one as of now, is myself. The only Mistress without an heiress. Everything has its limits in this world. Everything is balanced... Woe is me. But you and I will discuss that later."
526645, "Fine... As you wish."
526647, "I have such abilities too. I'm not one to doubt the existence of supernatural powers."
526648, "There was a prophecy of twin angels. It spoke of a harbinger of death, the imminent disaster incarnate, who is to come to the town-along with a holy healer who can perform miracles with her hands and deliver us from evil. Now I understand who is standing before me. Tell me, are you yourself aware of your calling?"
526649, "I am! I said so at once..."
526650, "I thought I was a mere modest servant of virtue..."
526651, "It may not quite be so..."
526652, "You're too kind to me."
526653, "Now, go to Alexander. Be brave, no matter what he asks you. You have nothing to be afraid of, for I see that you are the true harbinger. Such things can neither be changed nor hidden from me. Time has proven that I do not make mistakes. Fear nothing and return triumphant."

526702, "How do I approach Vlad the Younger?"
526703, "Ask his sister what he likes besides money; she'll be eager to talk about him. As soon as her light-filled thoughts fly towards him, he will feel Capella's sorrow for him... This will soften him and place him in our hands."

526717, "What do you want to learn from it?"
526718, "Try to expose it. If it clearly shows itself to be a liar-then my own prophecies are worthless too. And if it's telling the truth-ask him who you are."
526719, "All right. But how am I to find it, now that it's hiding from me?"
526720, "I feel that the sun is setting on the Saburovs. There's too little time left, it's almost tomorrow... Our reign has been short. And the price for it will be us turning from one of the town's most powerful people into some of its most miserable. Do you really need patronage from such people?"

526760, "I've come here on Alexander's orders. Same as you, I guess?"
526761, "Warehouse dwellers, by the looks of it; Grief's minions. They plundered the dead and finished off the wounded. They spared no-one! Although one dying man did manage to hide from them. In the fuss, no one noticed him crawl away towards the cemetery. He must have crossed the marsh... I suppose they're angry as hell!"
526762, "How do you know that?"
526763, "A bit of eavesdropping. I hid in the fuss too, and this is where I'm hiding from them now. They're out and about nearby; just gotten as far as the rocks. I'm waiting for them to go away so I can call for help and do what my lord told me to."
526764, "And who's this with you?"
526765, "He's not with me! A wounded homeless boy. At first I thought he was another survivor-but he's apparently just wandered in... So I'm thinking, maybe he's one of the rogue lot?"
526766, "Is he seriously injured?"
526767, "Well, he's carved up a good bit! See how he's clutching his side? So who's been getting playful with a knife? Been a while since anybody got knifed around here... And the other one, the one that crawled away to the cemetery-there wasn't an unbloodied spot on him. This one here was pretty lucky. You could almost say unharmed."
526768, "Yes. I am a faithful man, a servant of the Saburovs. There were two of us... We came to see about the dead and wounded, only to discover that robbers were already running rampant around here! They attacked us and... most likely killed my assistant."
526769, "What sort of robbers were they?"
526770, "I didn't mean to! I wanted to heal him! I felt sorry for him..."
526771, "Then it must have been the supreme judgement. With you as the judge. Yes... it makes sense. Had he deserved to live, you'd have given him life-right? But the murderer deserved to die, so you dealt him death. Yes... It's much like what the Mistress foretold!"
526772, "Who? Katerina?"
526773, "Yes... She screamed in her sleep a few days ago... Afterwards, her maids were whispering among themselves saying the Mistress had been talking deliriously in her sleep about a harbinger of fate who'd come in the guise of a child... Could that be you?"
526774, "Yes. It's me."
526775, "Don't touch me please, I'm as full of sin as they come... what if that's enough for your touch to kill me? My master would surely be interested, but you were meaning to heal... You had better find somebody else... That's what he sent you here for, right?"
526776, "Serves him right."
526777, "I see you're well informed... I suppose you're religious, faithful man? Do you read mystical and spiritual books?"
526778, "I doubt it..."
526779, "Those people were wondering if he had crawled away eastwards into the Steppe. He must have been from the Steppe himself, a local, so he'd want to be buried in living earth. If he's still breathing and has made it there, then the cemetery caretaker's daughter must have given him shelter."
526780, "Ah! I know her."
526781, "I'll tell Alexander that you're conscientiously doing your duty."
526782, "Thanks for the advice, faithful man."
526785, "Well... I suppose I had done what was a mighty rotten thing to do, and mucked it up like an idiot, at that. So my former Soul-and-a-Half mates, they threw me out, called me a traitor and all that. Hunted me. But I'm a slick one. I saved myself. Thought I'd made it out. And what do you know, along comes Leathersack!"
526786, "Leathersack?"
526787, "Some Ripper I'd never seen round here before. And he's like, stop right there, imma question you. Are you wanted for such-and-such crimes, are you carrying valuables on your person, exetra exetra-and then whack he goes with that razor. But I wriggled myself free-saved myself again! And then wobbled my way to this place, and then..."
526788, "What did you do to cross the boys? Look me in the eye and speak honestly, or else forget about getting help from me."
526789, "Uh... honestly, it was pretty bad. You see, there's those shmowder things. Y'know, powders-shmowders. We had an outbreak a couple of years ago-they called it the Sand Pest. It would burn up your blood. So these shmowders, they helped if you caught it. There are still some left, but they're hard to come by."
526790, "This is just abominable! I'm not touching someone like you, ever!"
526791, "Oh yes, yes! I'm all remorse and penny tins! Just do something, stop the bleeding at least, tie it with a hanky, would you? See how the bastard has sliced me into ribbons with that razor of his? Ah, just let me get to him. I'll tie him up and give him twice the pain he gave me!"
526792, "Be quiet and hold still! I'm going to lay my hands on you, and you'll get better."
526793, "...Good grief. Do you at least feel some remorse?"
526794, "I could heal you, but I won't. You're much too disgusting."
526795, "And...?"
526796, "A-and now there was this rumour, about the Pest being back and even a couple of folks, what's the word, sick-coming to it; and one of our lot had a shmowder. Was saving it for his sister in case she caught the Pest. Basically, I, you know, stole it."
526797, "What for? For yourself?"
526798, "Nah, not for myself. Our gang, the Soul-and-a-Halves, is at war with another gang, the Dogheads; quite a fight this is, last drop of blood and all. The Dogheads outnumber us, and they've set up their lair at the Tower. And the Tower is... a dream tower of pure gold, if you like. You wouldn't understand. So I thought I'd switch sides. With that shmowder as an admission fee."
526799, "So you stole medicine from a friend, who might need it to save his sister's life, and you did it so you could be a more desirable sell-out? Right?"
526800, "What does it matter! Everyone steals; everyone sells out; it's in our nature. Whoever isn't a thieving man-is a thieving woman, ha ha! The real nasty part is that when my scheme was out, the fool rushed me and tried to take his shmowder back, so I... waited for the right moment and offed him."
526801, "Ah, to hell with you!"
526802, "Take pity on me, please do, gentle girl... I may be a murderer, but I'm just a wee little murderer. I may end up reformed yet! After I've ripped nasty Ripper's throat out, that is."
526803, "You don't seem like you could take pity to anyone."
526804, "I feel that fate has brought me here for a reason. And made me meet such a wretch here for a reason, too."
526805, "I'm Burakh. Artemy Burakh. "
526806, "Don't hurt me, please."
526807, "I did. And what of it?"
526808, "Did you... did you kill him?"
526809, "No."
526810, "Have you healed him?"
526811, "And... did you want to?"
526812, "Who sent you?"
526813, "No one. I've come of my own accord."
526814, "Alexander Saburov, the ruler. It was him who tasked me with healing the wounded man!"
526815, "Then what the hell are you doing here?"
526816, "I'm looking for the wounded man..."
526817, "And why didn't you follow him yourself?"
526818, "It's better for me stay out of the town. Every passer-by rushes to tackle me and tie me up. I wonder what I did to deserve this Ripper fame."
526819, "It was certainly none of my doing!"
526820, "Don't stand in my way, Changeling! I don't care if you're a thief or not. But I don't want our paths to cross. Do you understand?"
526823, "No, but he will be soon. He's lost so much blood that only a miracle could revive him."
526824, "I can work miracles."
526825, "Curious. And how do you go about doing that?"
526826, "I lay my hands on someone in pain, and they are brought back to life."
526827, "...So not only are half the people here psychics. Turns out the other half are faith healers! What kind of a town is this? What kind of a time? I've been transported to the Middle Ages! I presume you can demonstrate your art right here in front of me?"
526828, "I can. Watch."
526829, "I'm a miracle worker."
526830, "Unbelievable..."
526831, "Many continue to disbelieve even after seeing it with their own eyes."
526832, "I myself sometimes find it hard to believe what I'm capable of."
526833, "Now I don't feel like it anymore. You're an evil man."
526834, "...So who is this killer? How do I find them? This is getting plain right diabolical!"
526835, "I'll tell you if I find something out."
526836, "It definitely wasn't me. You have to believe me."
526838, "Why interrogate me?"
526839, "Well, because I'm inclined to believe it was you who killed Simon."
526840, "...You're mad! Why?"
526841, "Superstitious people claim that Simon was killed by a demon. A creature they call the shabnak-adyg... which has the outward appearance of, if I recall correctly, a girl covered in earth's dirt. Now I despise superstition, but behind a tall tale there's often a truth that lends itself to rational explanation."
526842, "I'm not a demon! Quite the opposite! I can prove it."
526843, "Really? Prove it how?"
526844, "This man's already dead, I hope...?"
526845, "In a manner of speaking. To a degree. A degree that I feel used to be a good deal higher! God, why is the world filled with predators-wherever you run, from coast to coast! No place is safe from them! They murder, they rape, they tear apart, they threaten, they destroy..."
526846, "There are good people too..."
526847, "Are there? Look over, there's kind people for you. The Bachelor, giving orders like he's entitled to me... What could I tell him? All I can do is stay silent, swallowing my tears... And do you know why this is so, my girl? Listen... The Law is not on our side!"
526848, "The Law?"
526849, "Shh! Yes... You and I are outlaws. The Law is a grindstone, heavy as a bell, inexorable and persistent. You need a certain amount of power to stand up to it... But where do you get it? And so many of us here don't really have a choice; we are doomed to be victims."
526850, "Why are you counting me among them?"
526851, "You know, I recognized you at once, I did... Aren't you being persecuted? Aren't you being called a thief? Haven't you had the words 'shabnak', 'turnskin', 'maneater' thrown in your face? Haven't they looked for bones under your skin, or dropped swevery juice into your eyes?"
526852, "No, they haven't! Nothing of the sort..."
526853, "Pst! Quiet! He's listening!"
526854, "And... and you could cure any disease?"
526855, "Yes."
526856, "I don't know. It's not I who heal, it's the power that chose me as its instrument."
526857, "I will be your friend, girl... What else can you do?"
526858, "Isn't that enough for you? Anyway, you'll have a chance to see more... I'll be visiting you often."
526859, "A lot of... unusual things. People believe that I'm a miracle-worker."
526860, "Are you that scared of him?"
526861, "My goodness... Everything points to this Ripper being a heinous murderer! He's unstoppable. He could wrestle down Andrey Stamatin with just one arm. Ah, forget Andrey; the ghastliest thing is that he apparently killed a homeless boy in the Steppe today."
526862, "...Do you want me to ask him personally?"
526863, "There's no need to. There are more discreet ways to do it. I've heard he made friends with Warehouse dwellers... There are two gangs over at the Warehouses, Bad Grief's smugglers and the adolescent urchins. You can ask them; that homeless boy was a criminal as well."
526865, "Yikes! I can't take on so formidable an enemy, don't even think about it..."
526868, "Now explain to me why you're so afraid of circus performers."
526869, "How come...? Although-you are a kind girl, aren't you?-I suppose every cloud has a silver lining... You know, I'll tell you one of my secrets. But be hush-hush about it! Children... are the root of all evil in this world!"
526870, "And so?"
526871, "Yes, that homeless boy was attacked by the Haruspex, and he's dead now."
526872, "I realized what sort of an adolescent he was. He died at my hands. Because he was a rascal."
526880, "Ugh! He's been here all right. A right scary husky fellow, that one... No idea what got into his head to come over. I sure hope I've seen the last of him."
526881, "Why?"
526882, "Welp, it's a nasty story... That scoundrel, Lika, has commited a lowly vility! Sold us out to just about everyone out there-the thieves, the Dogheads too... then poisoned a friend he'd robbed, and ran away. I was angry, so I said the rascal deserves be killed. Angry as hell... And along comes this bloody Haruspex! Out of nowhere..."
526883, "So he's fond of running murderous errands?"
526885, "He didn't need it himself?"
526886, "He? He doesn't; he'd shoot anyone dead with his bare hands."
526887, "Notkin, my dear, give it to me. I'll dispose of it my way..."
526888, "Hey, I'm not greedy-and this one, by the way, is a lady's gun; it'll fit into your hand just right. Besides, it doesn't shoot... I guess."
526889, "Thank you, kind boy..."
526890, "Would you say he's a criminal?"
526891, "If anyone's a criminal here, it's me... No doubt about that now. Or is it you somehow making me soppy? Oh man, what have I done..."
526893, "I'm leaving."
526894, "He wants to know how... dangerous my supernatural abilities are."
526895, "...I suppose I was too quick to laugh at you... Let me see... You seem as though you were two people... You are a walking lie... But you shouldn't be killed yet. Everything depends on how this day ends... I'll have them tell uncle to talk to you. Let him answer your questions."
526896, "Your uncle... Georgiy has sent me to you... so that you could take a look at me and say what you think about me."
526897, "Why should I?"
526898, "Your abilities? Ha ha ha... Fine sort of a Mistress! Well, let me look at you then, let me listen to you carefully... What is he getting so nervous about?"
526899, "...I don't know. He demanded that I be examined by you."
526900, "Ha ha ha ha... How touching... Since when has this place become a hospital reception room? An elderly doctor's sending a patient for examination. Shall I write you a prescription?"
526901, "You don't seem particularly upset by your uncle's death."
526902, "I guess there's no need. Just say the words, I'll let him know."
526903, "Georgiy advised me to seek your counsel, Maria, on whether I'm worthy of asking him questions."
526904, "I have no idea. I'm just trying to do as the proverbial Romans do."
526905, "This is a Rome that one doesn't come uninvited to in the first place. What did Georgiy ask you about?"
526906, "You can see for yourself that my mystical abilities are negligible."
526907, "He said you should have a look at me."
526908, "You're a cheerful girl, aren't you, Maria. Let's have a good laugh together. Ha ha ha... ha?"
526909, "What are you talking about?"
526910, "You laid your hands on a mortally wounded man and brought him back to life, calling on the holy powers to bear witness. Your demeanour was, so they say, like that of a miracle-worker or even a saint of sorts. Is this so?"
526911, "I've done the honest thing and come before you, so you can see for yourself."
526912, "Is that so? Very well, I will lend you my ear, but no sooner than you have met Maria, my niece. Let her look at you with her own eyes and tell me who you are and how I should treat anything you tell me."
526915, "Do you know who murdered Simon?"
526916, "...No."
526917, "Are you sure he was murdered?"
526918, "...No."
526919, "Why have you ordered everyone to search for the murderer?"
526920, "...If there is a murderer, they must have no chance to escape."
526921, "Why are you afraid they'd escape?"
526922, "...No human being could have killed Simon. He was killed by a creature of supernatural powers."
526923, "Judge, you had no love for Simon and were no brother to him. Will you agree to answer my questions? Will you plunge into the darkness? Will you speak honestly and without guile?"
526924, "What is this gobbledygook? Are you playing tricks on me? Get out of here!"
526925, "Wait a moment..."
526926, "Ouch! There's no need to be rude!"
526927, "Who do you think you are? Did they send you to me, you wretch, in order to distract my attention from the real maneater? Get lost! And never enter this house again, or face my true anger."
526928, "As you wish..."
526929, "I will be back, Judge."

526943, "Forgiven? Why, I see no reason not to forgive him, but Maria, my daughter and, praise heaven, successor, is the one in charge now. She decided that it would be better for Rubin to spend these last and tumultous days behind bars."

526963, "I'm leaving."
526964, ""
526965, "Yes? What business brings you here?"
526968, "I can't contract the disease."
526969, "Whatever you do, prudence is always necessary."
526970, "Not always, far from it!"
526971, ""
526972, "I said I wanted to die, didn't I? Enough temptations for me; I don't need a confessor!"
526973, "Where did they take Rubin? Tell me and I'll get you out of here!"
526974, "No, it'll be the other way round. You get me out of here and then I'll tell you. I promise I will."
526975, "You won't get a chance to break that promise! Wait for me."
526976, "You shouldn't breathe prison air for too long..."
526977, "It all depends on you and you only."
526978, "I need the prisoner who accompanied Rubin."
526979, "I will do as you ask. At my own risk. And from now on, you can always ask me for help. You need protection."
526980, "He'll take my word for it."
526981, "Have you been told what the orders are yet? They're letting you go. Speak."
526982, "There's one more place in this town that has sturdy bars on windows. It's in the Works. They used to imprison those Luddite workers there. Superstitious Steppe folk would often sabotage the machines, and... You know the place I'm talking about, right?"
526983, "Thank you."
526984, ""
526985, "Gah! Not you!"
526986, "What happened here? "
526987, "I think they were shouting about going to Spin-a-Yarn Square."
526988, "And how do I get into the Theatre?"
526989, "I don't know. The exit didn't lead into the Theatre itself but a little way behind it... Search there. Or maybe summon this rat devil for help... He must know how to get to that creephole."

526994, "Did you see Rubin being brought here?"
526995, "I have witnessed quite a few mysterious events... That one was among them. It may have taken place in the future-or maybe the recent past... Which would you choose?"
526996, "I am."
526997, "Don't get cheeky with me, scum."
526998, ""
526999, "Are you a ghost?"
527000, "No."
527001, "There's even something lofty about it. Many will agree to atone for the wrongs they've inflicted upon the town in their lifetimes. There is, after all, no shortage of such villainous characters here. Bad Grief, Yulia, the Saburovs, Anna... even yours truly. Do I need to give any further examples? You could easily think of a half-dozen more yourself."

527006, "Transformations; metamorphoses again and again, over and over. How is it possible for demons to change the very nature of themselves? The Bachelor is involved with me and my path will take me to the Crucible. Again I will have to face Maria, for she is the keeper of the key to the mystery which binds me and Rubin together."
527007, "So this will be the field of our final conflict? Maria has decided to destroy Rubin, but he may still be alive! My final confederate, the Commander, will help to set him free..."
527008, "The soldiers have attacked Maria's servants. They have captured one of them and thrown him into jail. He will tell me where Rubin was taken."
527009, "The servant will tell me what I need to know in exchange for a pardon. Will the Commander refuse me this gift?"
527010, "The prisoner was set free."
527011, "They took Rubin to the Works and put him in a cell beneath the Corpulent Workshop. I should go there at once!"
527012, "My path has returned me to the Theatre where Rubin is being kept in some horrifying dungeon. The Rat Prophet waits there as well."
527013, "*** I have discovered the true nature of my gift... The ability to transform blood. Simon is no human being. There are only the Bound, people that follow him. A single touch of mine is enough to distinguish Simon's Bound; to turn them into imitations of Simon, willing to give their lives and sacrifice themselves to keep the town alive. The road to salvation is clear. I will go to the Inquisitor tomorrow."
527014, "It's not pretty, Burakh."
527015, "Really? Why?"
527016, "I know."
527017, "How do I find it?"
527018, "It's still unlocked and unguarded. You won't miss it... The Warehouses are within a stone's throw from here. They also serve as a lovely shelter for the at-odds-wth-the-law crowd, by the way. You've got that in common, so they'll most likely welcome you. Will you make it to the Warehouses?"
527019, "I'll have to mix with them somehow though..."
527020, "I don't like you. You're putting on quite unimpressive airs."
527021, "Get out of my way."
527022, "As if my life wasn't fun enough..."
527023, "Who are you? Why are you covered in blood?"
527024, "I am Artemy Burakh, son and heir to Isidor Burakh."
527025, "That's just my professional expenses. I am Artemy Burakh."
527026, "I don't like that."
527027, "Oh don't you fuss, you got yourself into the town from the right side. Scum and villains here, villains and scum. Shady folk livin' by the Warehouses since the world began... Us lot, we are used to them murderings, robberings, muggerings, killerings, and the likes."
527028, "So your gang is not the only one here?"
527029, "Bah! If only! One heart-balm there is, one and only, is we're the strongest. Officially we ain't no thieves, but rather humble storekeepers. But there is new blood, too... Someone's hired them doggies to guard their stuff, and no way they ain't got sticky fingers. Well, that's their business, not mine. But the boys, them little punks, those are on the rise! How could a man have guessed?"
527030, "What boys are you talking about?"
527031, "Some whippersnappers used to play around here. We didn't touch the lot, why would we? They're small fish, tiny fish. A cuff on the nape and a kick in the butt to shoo 'em away from here were enough. But they went on gangin'! Got 'emselves a real fighting unit and real dogs, snappish too. Gettin' on our nerves quite a bit. I was patient with 'em for a while... But now they're tryin' to get their hands on my goods! That I won't stand, not for a moment. 'Nough!"
527032, "Are you going to declare war on them?"
527033, "I'll start with one of them, the cockiest one, take care of him first. They had this traitor of theirs, ratted 'em out to us... The lil' punk was afraid for his life. But now the prick's turned on everyone! Both 'em lot 'n us. Poisoned one of my thieves, took the stash 'n ran off into the Steppe, that son of a bitch. We went lookin' for him, couldn't find him in the dark..."
527034, "Hey old boy, you've stirred the town, you have... Heavens know how many folks you've offed, they say, heh! But 'em blockheads weren't after you in the first place... So you only have to drop a word or two, and they'll go 'round believin' it all. They got 'emselves a new target already, they're after some bitch now, a shapeshifter dire and grim. So everythin' that's wrong is her doin' now. Even the wrongs you've done for real."
527035, "But I'm still a target, ain't I?"
527036, "There're a lot of things goin' on left and right, there are. I've got this feelin' we're gonna have a heavy day today, lotsa stuff happenin'. Depends on whatcha're lookin' for. What's your deal?"
527037, "I'm looking for trouble."
527038, "I could use some weapons..."
527039, "Really? That's interesting. And how long will they be there?"
527040, "I dunno, I didn't send 'em there. Tried to talk 'em out if it even... So it ain't my trouble if they come round complainin'. You catch my drift?"
527041, "I see what you're getting at. Thank you."
527042, "And...?"
527043, "I let him go."
527044, "A damn mess! They mistook me for someone else!"
527045, "Rather lowdown."
527046, "Pathetic."
527047, "How do I get to the warehouse where the boys play?"
527048, "What d'you need that for?"
527049, "I just do."
527050, "I'll ask them about that traitor of yours."
527051, "Really? Oh fine, I've got nothin' to hide from you. Impossible to hide anythin' around here anyway. I'll show you the place. It's in the southern part of the Warehouses, just you get past the railroad. Maybe they'll letcha in."
527052, "Thank you."
527053, "Who is this Grief?"
527054, "Bad Grief is the kingpin of the criminal world. He has a lair in the northern Warehouses, where he trades in weapons, twyrine, and other nastiness. Every murderer and criminal has a connection to him one way or another; that's the way it goes here. And that's why I'm asking you again: were you on your way to him or not?"
527055, "Do I look like a criminal to you!?"
527056, "Hm... Some people came running through the Warehouses a few minutes ago. They told everyone that a horrible killer-the whole town's apparently already out to get him-had tried to escape by train, got ambushed, killed everyone, and was now going back here. And so now I'm thinking: were they perhaps talking about you?"
527057, "It's a misunderstanding. I came from far away and got attacked."
527058, "Lika. The name fits; the prick's a natural-born boot-licker. I can't even figure out who he's sold out to, the thieves or the Dogheads. He's stolen the most precious thing from us, from his mates! The bastard! And on top of that, he's done it right when a war's about to start!"
527060, "It was self-defence. They mistook me for someone else."
527061, "Okay then. You do look like you've been through a lot... We'd like to help you, but we've been robbed too. And, as bad luck would have it, it's the medicine that's been snatched! Lika, that bastard! He's a traitor, a thief, a thug, and a prick!"
527062, "Who are you talking about?"
527065, "I refuse to be rewarded for a deed like this."
527066, "I think I'll go speak to this Grief of yours."
527067, "Hey... That's nothin', nothin' at all! So I took somethin'. It's common property, right? So it's mine, too. They'd have slangwhanged over the shmowder anyway, he heh. Ya could say I did them a favour! And so I hurt the doggy, true, but in self-defence, nothin' more! One's right to defend himself is sacred, right?"
527068, "That was unconvincing."
527069, "Yes... Can't argue with you here."
527070, "Poisoned? With what?"
527071, "Well... twyrine... Didn't you know?"
527072, "No."
527073, "He needs to be given a blood transfusion."
527074, "Is there anyone who could perform it?"
527075, "You are one clever girl, Capella."
527076, "Can I have a rest here?"
527077, "Of course! Here's a bed, just lie down and sleep to your heart's content."
527078, "Thank you, Victoria."
527079, "I don't."
527080, "Well, maybe that's for the better... You never know..."
527081, "It is hard to fight the mob with bare hands."
527082, "All right. I'll speak to this bachelor."
527083, "Just wait till the evening, please. Right now he is also confused... so he'll shoot first and ask questions later. And just... please do your best not to break more bones. Do not attack random people in the street. Just go easy on them and work on gradually restoring your good name... Also go see my daughter right now. She's a good girl, and she's got something to tell you."
527084, "Is that so?"
527085, "It is. All of them have been seeing Isidor quite often lately. Maybe some of them can even surmise who the real killer is. And the rest know for a fact that you are innocent! They are Bound, and so accusing a person of patricide would be unnatural to them... even if the evidence is obvious."
527086, "Happy to hear that."
527087, "They can help you find out how your father spent his last evening. I only know that he went off into the Steppe for a very long time and came back very late last night. That is when the children went to see the old man in secret."
527088, "What for?"
527089, "Notkin, tell me please, did you see Isidor Burakh, my father, yesterday?"
527090, "Whoa... So that's with whom I have the honour. My apologies, sir. I had no idea. Thought you were a random tramp. So you already know he's been murdered, right?"
527091, "I do. Do you know how?"
527092, "The lads told me he'd returned from the Steppe, so I went to visit him. He'd spent many days in the Steppe this time, you know. I thought he might tell me something about the Bulls. So there I went, but all I saw was smoke, and the stench was as if someone was burning a blanket. The lights were on, but he wasn't there. He went to Simon. Came back almost at dawn and chased me off."
527093, "Chased you off?"
527094, "Well... People are saying a demon of the Steppe killed him. A shabnak. A maneater made of bones, you know? The thing is, her claw was stuck in his chest when they found him. Well, not necessarily hers... but it was a monster's claw. Or a fang... A bone, anyway."
527095, "What? What monster?"
527096, "A huge one. Claw the size of a man's elbow. A crooked bone, snapped at its base. The rumour flew right away that a maneater from the scary stories, the shabnak-adyr, had come out of the Steppe to punish us."
527097, "When was the last time you saw him?"
527098, "Stomping his feet even! 'Don't you even come close to me,' he said. It was weird, he'd always been a kind old man... I thought maybe I'd done something wrong. And right afterwards this Lika bastard caused all that mess, so I had to go back. I only heard about the claw in the morning. Haven't seen it myself."
527099, "...Are my nails really that long?"
527100, "Yeah, I've heard... you've been falsely accused. People have been told to go catch Simon's murderer at the Station. That was before the claw, Isidor hadn't been found yet. Then they declared there was one murderer; Simon had been killed by a shabnak. Fine tangle, this whole business..."
527101, "Thank you, Notkin."
527102, "Grace, did you see my father, Isidor Burakh, yesterday?"
527103, "Oh, I did! I saw him return from the Steppe."
527104, "Have you talked to him?"
527105, "No, but I followed him. He entered his house, and then I felt that he was anxious... desperate even. He smelled of smoke. I didn't dare knock on the door, but peeked through the window."
527106, "What did you see?"
527107, "I saw him take off his warm clothes, take them outside, and burn them. Then he wiped his body with cloth, threw it on the floor and burnt it as well. Then he got dressed and left. I followed him. I tried to call out for him quietly, but he didn't hear me. He arrived at the Stone Yard and knocked on Simon's door. They let him in."
527108, "And then?"
527109, "Then I went back. I stopped by at Murky's on my way to tell her old Isidor was back."
527110, "Who is Murky?"
527111, "A girl. An orphan, like me. She lives in a carriage and doesn't really like to talk."
527112, "Good. I don't like babblers."
527113, "Thank you, Grace."
527114, ""
527115, "You're so big..."
527116, "Murky, tell me, did you go to my father-to Isidor yesterday?"
527117, "You'll also grow up in due time."
527118, "I did. Grace invited me to."
527119, "When?"
527120, "At night."
527121, "So you didn't sleep?"
527122, "I didn't. I rarely sleep at night."
527123, "What did you see?"
527124, "I saw him return home. He sat down and was just sitting for the longest time. Didn't move. Fell asleep most likely. Then I came back here. Saw you arrive."
527125, "What? You saw me get off the train?"
527126, "I saw you get into a fight too. Then I hid myself and fell asleep."
527127, "So you came back from my father, and then I arrived... Has a lot of time passed between these two events?"
527128, "Yes. I had enough time to repair the mousetrap."
527129, "Will you tell what you've just told me to anyone else if I bring them here?"
527130, "I will."
527131, "Thank you, Murky."
527132, "I live here. See this van?"
527133, "Cosy."
527134, "What's your name?"
527135, "My name is Murky. Your nose is tilted."
527137, "Well... that can be helped."
527138, "I'll make do."
527139, "I need to be alone for a while."
527140, "If the Bachelor finds you before you find him... the consequences... need I say more? But first you need to find convincing arguments in your favor... so that you two have something to talk about when you finally meet. Me vouching for you won't be enough..."
527141, "But how can that be done?"
527142, "I don't know yet... I wonder what my daughter has to say about it. She's inherited a lot from her mother, you know. She can feel the things that we cannot even imagine. Subordination is essential, true, but the girl is undoubtedly smarter than me."
527143, "Did my father know beforehand he would die... for the same reason?"
527144, "I don't know."
527145, "How do you know about it then?"
527146, "I won't go!"
527147, "Shaking in your boots, are you now, you witch? The mere sound of Maria's name is enough to send you running! Hardly a surprise... Guards! Hey! Anybody there?"
527148, "I only bring goodness into this world. Such is my nature."
527149, "I can work miracles. It's been attested."
527150, "All the same, I don't believe you. Besides, you claim to have an evil twin. So which one of you two is the real one and which is the changeling?"
527151, "Why have you come to me, fearsome child, posing as a miracle-worker?"
527152, "I wanted to ask you about Simon, the late ruler."
527153, "I wanted to tell you something about your brother Simon."
527154, "Wait! I'm not afraid of her. I'll go."
527155, "Goodbye!"
527156, "Deep inside, you know he wasn't murdered by anyone, don't you?"
527157, "...Yes."
527158, "What's more, you're sure of it, right?"
527159, "Do you believe that I'm not the murderer?"
527160, "...No."
527161, "Why do you suppose I'd kill him?"
527162, "And you want to know what the creature looks like?"
527163, "...No. I want to know what power it wields."
527164, "And now answer my final question. Will any of the Kains benefit from this death?"
527165, "...No. None of us would be able to advance and sustain the town in the way Simon did. And if his death was not a tragic accident but the ruling of some remorseless law, it will mean that our family's entire cause has been condemned. The town will perish."
527166, "Could one of the townsfolk be the murderer?"
527167, "Will you kill them at once if you catch them?"
527168, "Sleep. Poor old man... Let some sleep soothe him at least a little."
527169, "What are you going to do now?"
527170, "...I will try to keep believing that his death was an accident. For as long as I can keep this belief alive, I'll be able to strive for our creation to flourish as it always did."
527171, "Will you replace Simon?"
527172, ""
527173, "And why have you come to me? I know all I need to know about you now, Plague Incarnate."
527174, "I'd like to tell you about a most amazing thing..."
527175, "Really? That's sweet. Will you tell me? Not that it matters, of course..."
527176, "We can preserve this town. The army will leave. There won't have to be any destruction."
527177, "Yeah? What do you want?"
527178, "Why doesn't it matter?"
527179, "I'll give the package to the Bachelor. If that's the price for saving the town, so be it."
527180, "I must say, though, that I don't have the slightest idea where he's to be found now. I suppose his new ally is better informed of his plans."

527189, ""
527190, "Why are you here?"

527193, "It will be too late! They'll have shot the Bachelor!"
527194, "I have no other choice. I'm in charge of maintaining order, and I have my own orders to follow. Moreover, my intuition is telling me that Bachelor Dankovsky will make it out of there alive. He's not the type to let himself get shot in the head easily."

527207, "Who, me?"
527208, "One of us is an idiot, right?"

527216, "He would have died. I wanted to take his life by cunning, in order to stay head of the Kin. Now that I have you, transformer of blood, I see a better use for myself. Go. Your Haruspex is awaiting the verdict of his fate in the cave at the Gorge."

It hasn't lost its bond with the Earth. It combines incompatible things. Different eras linger in it alongside each other. There are no towns like this anymore... and there'll hardly ever be again..."

It will be tamed, just like smallpox. I'll do this with my hands. I'm going to stay here. We can inoculate people. And people will survive."

527230, "That's why you're a thief. You're guilty of the theft of your own fate. You were never to try on this halo. It's as absurd as a hangman playing the miraculous rescuer while the execution is already ongoing."
527231, "Now I understand everything..."
527232, "I'm giving you an hour to leave the town, you little scum. I'm banishing the plague from this place, thereby accomplishing my mission. Out! And don't you dare look for a protector; no one's going to help you now."
527233, "We'll see..."
527234, "The Inquisitor has ordered me to leave the town before the end of today."
527235, "Indeed? This once again confirms that I was right about you. This is how a divine messenger would behave. I am your protector. Tell me what you want."
527236, "I know of a number of people who have already resigned to their impending death. They even believe they deserve it. All I need is to find several volunteers among the Bound."
527237, "Go and look for the ones you need then. I'll order my soldiers to defend you, should anyone dare make an attempt at your life. It's a shame that so few have remained loyal-and there'll be even less after we crush the revolt completely. But we will persevere! Afterwards, come back to me and tell me if you've been successful."
527238, "Why should I come back?"
527239, "Wait. You're speaking too fast. I have different concerns at the moment. Actually it's good that you're here. Can you run one final errand for me-and then tell me about your decision? The business I have at hand is urgent."
527240, "What is this?"
527241, "Give this package to kind Bachelor Dankovsky. It says inside that he's been stripped of all authority and is accused of high treason. Should he open it in front of you and ask you what he is to do, advise him to shoot himself."
527242, "Why so? I thought you were friends..."
527243, "What? Friends? No, of course not! The Bachelor has become no less formidable of an enemy of the town than Lady Sand Pest."
527244, "But why?"
527245, "You see, this town is a coherent structure or, if you like, a living organism. It's both, depending on the observer. It's like a sequence of interconnected organs or, more exactly still, a clockwork mechanism. But as soon as a foreign object is introduced, everything begins to crumble..."
527246, "I'm telling you, I know a way to avoid destroying anything that's been constructed here!"
527247, "Because there's a more important objective now. It's time to get rid of the Bachelor. He's gone too far."
527248, "What?"
527249, "Whatever; just give the package to the Bachelor. We'll talk when you come back."
527250, "But what does the Bachelor have to do with it?"
527251, "Bachelor Dankovsky has had the audacity to question this obvious truth. Apparently, he intends to destroy the human settlement-that is, the town proper, an administrative and social constituent unit of our country-for the sake of a chimaeric abomination! I'm going to stop him."
527252, "There won't have to be any sacrifices, Inquisitor. Take my word for it."
527253, "All right. Give me the package."
527254, "What if there's poison in there or something like that? No, I'm not going..."
527255, "I think I know a way out... But I'm going to need your participation."
527256, "Who but the iron-toothed General Ashes! The two destroyers now sing in unison. Getting half a million people killed is like putting a squiggle on paper to them."
527257, "I'll find the Bachelor."
527258, "Give me the package."
527259, "I must say, though, that I don't have the slightest idea where he's to be found now. I suppose his new ally is better informed of his plans."
527260, "What new ally?"
527261, "Who but the iron-toothed General Ashes! The two destroyers now sing in unison. Getting half a million people killed is like putting a squiggle on paper to them."
527262, "Don't worry. I'll find the Bachelor."
527264, "He's the one who needs to worry. Not me."
527265, "..."
527266, "I don't understand yet."
527267, "Doctor Rubin has conducted a scientific study. He has ascertained that the plague hasn't killed Simon Kain after all. Simon's blood contained corpuscles that had made the disease harmless. When I heal someone with my hands, their blood becomes like that too."
527268, "So you're going to cure everyone as they get infected? I wonder how you'll manage it with a population of many thousand at this rate of contagion! Or the entire country's population if the disease escapes from the town."
527269, "No, no... Of course I won't be enough. All the more because the blood needs to be predisposed... But there are people with this kind of blood who've agreed to... spend themselves entirely on vaccines for everyone else. I'll show them to you tomorrow!"
527270, "So you're saying you'll be able to maintain this fateful, this unnatural blend and even create a possibility for-oh my God-its further development through periodic transformation of some townspeople's blood, with a subsequent slaughtering of these people after the manner of what was done to Simon?"
527271, "Yes. That's correct."
527273, "I can perform a miracle. No one else can, which is why no one else has thought of the same plan. Everyone believes miracles to be impossible."
527274, "Another one... Nina was enough! She, too, used to sing about miracles, and ended up turning the town into a pagan altar. You'd like to set up a bloody conveyor line in which you will hold the key position, right? I won't let that happen!"
527277, "But why destroy when everything can be preserved?"
527278, "It's the Powers That Be who want to preserve everything; that's the reason there's an epidemic. Who do you think you are? You're no miracle-worker. You are an avatar of the Sand Plague. Do you understand? But instead of acting as an honest instrument of the Law, you have stolen the fate of another."
527279, "Oh no... Anything but that..."
527280, "But..."
527281, "Enough! No more of this talk! Why are you so blind? Another obsessed idiot dragging thousands of victims into the very same trap! No, no... enough! Help me destroy the Polyhedron or leave the town at once-or else I'll have you executed!"
527282, "Awesome!"
527283, "I didn't quite understand... But it looks like it."
527284, "They were going to execute someone by firing squad, but the squad turned out to be the mutineers. He's still not back yet. Will you go to the headquarters?"
527285, "Yes."
527286, "I haven't decided yet."
527287, "Find out about him, please! I think it's Andrey who they were going to execute. He'd killed several soldiers yesterday when they were arresting Peter. I fear it won't end well."
527288, "All right, just don't you cry."
527289, "He shouldn't have walked into the firing line."
527290, "No. He's not here. And I wouldn't advise you to follow him where he's gone."
527291, "And where is that?"
527292, "And what about you?"
527293, "I'm gathering those who've stayed true to their oath. As soon as I restore order among my troops, we'll launch an operation to retake the cannon. I'll personally lead the loyal units."
527294, "And... where is all that happening? The mutiny?"
527295, "They've seized a cannon and are holding position next to it. All of the mutineers are there now, except the ones who are busy looting. But don't you dare go there; they'll sort it out without you."
527296, "So there's been a revolt within the ranks?"
527297, "Are there many of these mutineers?"
527298, "No. I'm going. My faith protects me."
527299, "Why on earth did she do that?"
527300, "I've come up with a way to keep this town intact. All three of its parts, all three towns: the town of beasts, the town of men, and the town of children... But she said that as long as she's alive, that won't happen."
527301, "And no surprise. So you've defied her plans?"
527302, "I think I have... She's bent on destroying the Polyhedron."
527303, "Yes... And the Bachelor was going to rescue this architect precisely in order to find out whether the tower's brittle groundwork could withstand the bombardment if we had to level the residential areas..."
527304, "I know a way to preserve the town! But I need more time... a day at the very least."
527305, "How many do you need?"
527306, "Seven, at least."
527307, "I could put not seven, but seventy-seven men at your disposal."
527308, "No... for one thing, they have to be Bound. Not all people are the same. These ones... have a rare blood type."
527309, "All of these people will have to die. Furthermore, their free consent to it will be required."
527310, "I've found the seven people!"
527311, "That quickly?"
527312, "I don't think that was quick."
527313, "I must know with what arguments I am to defend your decision before the Inquisitor tomorrow. Force alone is not enough. All the more so because I don't have a lot of it left at my disposal... and will have even less by tomorrow evening."
527314, "All right. I will be back!"
527315, "You've just been here and said there were sinners in this town, nine in total, who could sacrifice themselves for the cause of obtaining transformed blood. Sadly, you said, some of them were already incurably ill... You even hinted that their disease had been a consequence of your visit."
527316, "What?"
527317, "You named names: Rubin, Foreman Oyun, the Saburovs-I've heard about those-then... Anna, Yulia, Aspity, Lara, and Grief. You said some of them were ill now."
527318, "But it wasn't me!"
527319, "My eyes weren't lying to me. It was you. You described the way you could transform their blood so that it could be used to create a vaccine for the entire population. You... left and came back a quarter of a minute later."
527320, "No... It was her again! My abhorrent doppelganger. It was she who infected my Bound!"
527321, "Tomorrow, you'll have time to bring them back to life."
527322, "It's the only hope I have left..."
527323, "Listen to me, Grief. I am the harbinger of your death. What it will be like is up to you."
527324, "I've been expectin' somethin' like that... One can spot a Mistress-to-be from a verst away. Do the speakin' then, I'm all ears."
527325, "Do you want to die a thief, a murderer, a profiteer, and a smuggler?"
527326, "Do you want to die a champion, a martyr, and a saviour to your people?"
527327, "No, Mistress... I don't."
527328, "Yes, Mistress. That's exactly how I'd like to die... like I ever could."
527329, "I'm going to lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die as Simon Kain died-if you agree to sate the thirsty with your blood, like he did."
527330, "I'm going to lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die as Simon Kain died-if you agree to sate the thirsty with your blood, like he did."
527331, "Simon? Simon was a demigod. His blood... I've heard from Stakh about his blood. His was no blood of a human. There's blue blood, and then there's... silver blood, eh? 'N that's what his was."
527332, "I'll lay my hands on you, and your veins will be filled with golden and silver and blue blood. Cut yourself and you'll see."
527333, "With blood like that, cuttin' myself would be... wasteful."
527334, "So you agree?"
527335, "I do... Do I even have a choice? Eh? Indeed... I'll even be grateful to you."
527336, "And you won't renounce that tomorrow?"
527337, "I won't, Mistress."
527338, "You'd better not. Goodbye."
527339, "Heed my words, Foreman Oyun. I am the harbinger of your death. You can choose what it will be like."
527340, "I have chosen already. What right to you have to speak in this way to me, who was placed here by the loins of Suok, Mother of Clay, and the founder himself, Bos Turokh?"
527341, "Would you like to die as one who has failed to perform the rite?"
527342, "No."
527343, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527344, "Will you transform me into Bos Primigenius? Do you possess the power to turn a human into an aurochs?"
527345, "Yes. And you'll be convinced of it."
527346, "I am convinced already. Promises are unneeded. I want to undo my shame and die like a Warden."
527347, "So you agree?"
527348, "Yes. I agree."
527349, "Will you agree to testify before the General?"
527350, "I will if you deem it necessary."
527351, "May Suok imbue you with her vital humours."
527352, "Would you like to die like a true servant of Suok, nourishing the black nostrils of the soil with blood that heals?"
527353, "Yes."
527354, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527355, "The right of a Mistress of the Humble. Heed me, Foreman Oyun, as you heeded Nina the Wild and Victoria the Lucent."
527356, "Yes. I see that you have the right. Speak."
527357, "Yes. I'm quick!"
527358, "I see... Which of them exactly?"
527359, "Everything is lost now, isn't it?"
527360, "You don't want to destroy the town, do you?"
527361, "No. I don't. I'm prepared to sacrifice my career in order to avoid razing and killing this town."
527362, "Why?"
527363, "I was born and raised in a town like this one. Firing at it is torture for me. But that isn't the main reason..."
527364, "I'm surprised to hear you talk like that..."
527365, "Everything in this town is precious. This place is symbolic. That which is below has left our world for good-having turned into lifeless bones, into museum pieces. That which is above will never come around again. It's a potential future that I don't want to lose."
527366, "How do you know?"
527367, "The Haruspex has demonstrated the former to me, and the Bachelor, the latter. Written into this town is the destiny of our entire country. And I feel that the Creator is watching me now, as I'm making my choice. The part I am to play in the fate of this town will have an effect on the part I am to play in the fate of our country."
527368, "I have felt the same."
527369, "Everything will be all right."
527370, "If you transform my blood with your hands, I'll part without regret with the life that I have lived and tainted. Let the good that comes out of my death give a meaning to my wasted life."
527371, "Why do you say so?"
527372, "Yes. When they have agreed to give you their blood for transformation into the panacea, the Kin will help you put that blood to use. You will have at your disposal the skills of the butchers, of all who know the lines, and the Abattoir itself-Suok's womb. Burakh will not oppose it."
527373, "You didn't kill Burakh?"
527374, "After I give my transformed blood, he will inherit my authority over the Kin."
527375, "He said you'd told him to descend into the abyss."
527376, "I bow to thee, Mistress. You have come to take my life. I am prepared to sacrifice it."
527377, "I say what I say and do what I do because I, Oyun, have failed to perform the rite and to carry the burden I took upon myself. I am not worthy of living. Many among the Bound would tell you the same."
527378, "Many?"
527379, "Did you call me Mistress?"
527380, "Warden Burakh and Oynon Rubin have told me of your miracles. She who can turn the blood of the children of Suok into the blood of Bos Primigenius is worthy of being titled our Mistress."
527381, "What makes you sure they'll agree?"
527382, "A Mistress needs not ask. They have already accepted their fate. Let them serve their lady, the Mistress of the Humble. If you find several of such Bound, who won't resent having to give up their meaningless lives, you will create enough vital humours to keep the town alive. Do you agree to take and transform my blood?"
527383, "No. I will not kill him anymore."
527384, "Why?"
527385, "Yes, if such is your desire."
527387, "No. I don't want to."
527465, "So you're the harbinger of my doom... Or will you give me some advice on how to escape my well-deserved punishment?"
527466, "So it is well-deserved?"
527467, "The Inquisitor won't forgive me for my treason. The only surprising thing is that she found out so soon. I've only just made the decision, and she knows already... That woman is indeed a devil. But in any case, I won't change my decision, even if it costs me my life."
527468, "You shouldn't ascribe such a role to me."
527469, "And what is your decision?"
527470, "I want to preserve the Polyhedron. And I will preserve it, whatever it takes."
527471, "And Aglaya wants it destroyed?"
527472, "Yes. And this sly schemer played me so well that, but for a lucky coincidence, I myself would have now desired it above all else in the world! Her infernal design would have become my own discovery. Aglaya believes the Polyhedron to be the cause of the outbreak."
527473, "And that's not so?"
527474, "What does it matter? It may have been the reason the epidemic began, but it's not the reason it's still there! Destroying the Tower won't stop it. One must not imagine a clash of supreme powers behind this. This is mechanics, not mysticism! That's what I've been trying to convince Peter of."
527475, "And what does Peter say?"
527476, "He believes, as you probably know, that the epidemic is a punishment for the hubris he and his brother committed by building this masterpiece. However, he would also rather lose his life than his tower. It's too marvellous an achievement. Let all else burn; the Tower must remain!"
527477, "Why?"
527478, "Because for the first time in human history, a structure has been built which-owing as much to engineering calculation as to a favourable concourse of circumstances-possesses a miraculous capacity for influencing the human consciousness. It can, if you like, store the dreams of children."
527479, "How is that possible?"
527480, "That's the thing; this tower makes the impossible possible. I didn't believe it either until I saw for myself. But the fact remains. The children are unanimous in insisting that the Tower reproduces that very spirit which turns childhood into the happiest time of a human life."
527481, "If that's true, it's indeed a miracle..."
527482, "Yes! The elusive dreamworlds, the magical lands of fantasy, the first loves, the childhood games with their heroic deeds, their sieges and charges, escapes and transfigurations-it condenses them into a nodule of energy inside itself, which, being the creation of a child's fantasy, assumes an independent existence."
527483, "What does that mean? I don't understand..."
527484, "Yes, this is a dream one can come back to. A fantasy unfolding in front of your eyes. A miracle that can be touched and held. There, inside it, things that are fleeting gifts in ordinary life can be captured."
527485, "A miracle can't be touched and held. It's the law!"
527486, "A tower like that should not be destroyed."
527487, "I'm asking you for a postponement. I know how to preserve the Polyhedron. Everything else here will have to be destroyed-but the Polyhedron can be saved. Tell Aglaya you haven't found me, and I'll find arguments to convince the Commander. He'll let the Polyhedron be with a clear conscience: the epidemic won't return if the Tower stands."
527488, "And you can prove it to him?"
527489, "Give me more time, and tomorrow I'll give you a package containing arguments for the Commander."
527490, "All right. Have it your way. I'll tell Aglaya I haven't found you."
527491, "Why?"
527492, "...I can't believe it's you talking! Where's your usual skepticism?"
527493, "A dream can't be made real. The fulfilment of a wish will always be a bitter parody of a dream. Such is the law."
527494, "I've been inside that tower. It's empty. Tell me, is that an illusion?"
527495, "No. I'm not going to give you more time. Take this package, it's for you. Die, Bachelor; such is your fate."
527496, "Wait! Then help me get rid of an enemy who's about to present Aglaya with a fateful argument which will leave the Commander with no choice but to raze the Polyhedron!"
527497, "Who's that?"
527498, "Burakh, the Haruspex. He's due to finish some gruesome business today. If he succeeds, he and Aglaya will deceive Block. That is to say, Aglaya will do all the actual deceiving. Burakh is a blind tool of hers, just like I was until recently."
527499, "Why is he dangerous?"
527500, "They'll preserve the toxic town for the sake of saving Aglaya, and raze the Polyhedron in order to have... a culprit's head to present the Powers That Be with. They'll say the cause has been eliminated. Find him and stop him!"
527501, "All right. You have convinced me."
527502, "Go do it yourself. If you've been able to save people from the firing squad, you'll have no trouble getting rid of the Haruspex."
527503, "I must stay here and complete what I've started. I have too little time left now."
527504, "All right. I'll find him."
527505, "I have other plans. Goodbye, Bachelor."
527506, "Miraculously."
527507, "Did you make him do it?"
527508, "Yes."
527509, "I am a mere instrument of fate."
527510, "Why did he do it?"
527511, "Because everyone has a preordainment to fulfil. His is to be a sacrificial victim."
527512, "Because everyone has a preordainment to fulfil. Yours is to preside over the Kin."
527513, "You've turned out to be much more powerful than I thought. Why did you do this?"
527514, "Tell me what you're intending to do, Burakh."
527516, "I must make a blood sacrifice. But I haven't settled on one yet. I don't know who it was meant to be. I must decide. That moment is probably inevitable, and it will come soon."
527517, "You are a slave of the inevitable, Burakh, while I am its Mistress. Tell me what your intentions are, and I'll help you."
527518, "Dankovsky said Aglaya and you had agreed to tear down the Polyhedron."
527519, "I only want one thing, and that's to heal the town. The destruction of the Polyhedron was necessary, seeing as I never hoped I would defeat the Foreman."
527520, "But that wasn't what happened. So what now?"
527521, "How were you going to save the town? It's infected and dangerous-a cancer in the body of our country."
527522, "If this will save my town, I hereby agree. Tomorrow I'll be able to back it up with arguments for Aglaya. She must submit a report on the decision reached, in order to avoid being executed."
527523, "But I loathe this town, Burakh. I want it to die."
527524, "Is that so?"
527525, "Yes. So tell Aglaya. Let her in on your plan. I think she'll accept it."
527526, "Where are you going to get it from?"
527527, "Ask Stakh Rubin about it."
527528, "I transform blood with my hands. I'm a miracle-worker, Burakh."
527529, "Yes, that sounds true enough. I believe you. What would you have me do?"
527530, "Promise me that when you become head of the Kin, you'll help me by creating as much panacea as will be needed to contain the disease."
527531, "All right. I'll do it."
527532, "Have your arguments ready by tomorrow."
527533, "I walk where I want."
527534, "Definitely not me."
527535, "I promised to help?"
527536, "You've just been here and said you know what trickery the Foreman has prepared for me. You've promised you'll be waiting where the Foreman will have told me to go, and help me defeat him."
527537, "What did Foreman Oyun tell you yesterday?"
527538, "I want to ask the Foreman about the mysteries concealed in the ritual of bovine sacrifice. I feel I have no other way to access those mysteries than by taking the Foreman's place. Oyun will not give up his power without a fight. We're going to fight to the death."
527539, "That wasn't me. Tell me what the matter is."
527540, "Do you think Foreman Oyun is one of the Bound?"
527541, "Doubtlessly."
527542, "He is a bad man, isn't he?"
527543, "I suspect he is a double-crossing murderer and usurper. That's why I can wish death upon him with a clear conscience."
527544, "You change your plans quickly. A short while ago you were much more bloodthirsty. I'll waste no time. My destiny awaits me at the Abattoir. I'm going to face it with an open heart."
527545, "Wait until the day ends. We'll see each other at the Abattoir."
527546, "Don't rush into a fight with him. I'll go to the Abattoir and settle your dispute."
527547, ""
527548, "I can read my fate in your eyes."
527550, "It may turn out not to be what you think it is."
527551, "Listen to me, Anna. I am the harbinger of your death. You can choose what it will be like."
527552, "I want my death to be painless. Can you make me die without suffering?"
527553, "Would you like to die a child-murderer?"
527554, "No! Let at least my posthumous memory break free from the remembrance of the Ace of Diamonds Caravan!"
527555, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527556, "Are you going to take my blood?"

527558, "I believe you."
527559, "Do you agree?"
527560, "If you promise me that my name will be remembered kindly... Let me be remembered as a singer."
527561, "And you won't go back on your promise tomorrow?"
527562, "No. I won't."
527563, "We'll all die, Anna. Rejoice, for I'm giving you the longest deferment."
527564, "Would you like to die a champion and a martyr? Would you like to save thousands of children's lives?"
527565, "Is that even possible?"
527566, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527567, ""
527568, "Here comes the girl, destined to disprove my 'trip wires of fate' theory."
527569, "Possibly, Yulia."
527570, "Yulia, listen to me. I am the harbinger of your death. You can choose what it will be like."
527571, "I've already made my choice. I will succumb to rheumathoid arthritis at roughly the same age Simon was when he passed away."
527572, "I'm serious. You have a lot less time to live than you think. Would you like your death to be pointless and unnoticed?"
527573, "Now that you ask, I'd certainly prefer the whole country-far-eastern colonies inclusive-to mourn my heartbreaking departure."
527574, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527575, "'Those in thirst?' Happy days... Do you have many such associates?"
527576, "You're laughing... But you shouldn't. Simon's blood was used to create a medicine that has saved many from the infection."
527577, "That's what I've heard... His blood was not consistent with any previously observed haematic biometry profile? I think I know what it is that you want now. But what gives you the idea that my blood is uncommon in the same way? "
527578, "I don't think. I know it for certain. Do you agree then?"
527579, "Sure, why not... You know very well it is near impossible to refuse your requests. Makes me wonder why you even ask."
527580, "And you won't go back on your promise tomorrow?"
527581, "You heard what I said, Clara, and it's not in my nature to change my mind. I'd like to have a little recuperative shut-eye now, if you don't mind."
527582, "I'll see you tomorrow, Yulia."
527583, "There's a different way you can become like Simon. To become someone that much more like him. Will you agree to sacrifice yourself for the sake of the people and be glorified as a champion of faith?"
527584, "This doesn't sound like a bad idea at all... I wouldn't mind a finale this dramatic."
527585, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527586, "Yes, take a rest. You're exhausted."
527587, ""

527589, "Don't cry. Wipe your tears."
527592, "Lara, listen to me. I am the harbinger of your death. You can choose what it will be like."
527593, "What, do I have to pack my things? I'm going to be executed, right?"
527594, "No, Lara. No one wants you to die, not even I. But it can't be avoided. Will you agree to sacrifice yourself for the people's sake and be glorified as a champion of faith?"
527595, "Yes. That is exactly how I'd like to die. Perhaps it will further convince people of our family's nobleness."
527596, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527597, "Was that really how Simon died?"
527598, "Yes. A drop of his blood is coursing through the veins of every person saved from the disease with a shot of the 'white vaccine'."
527599, "A good death. By what time do I have to have made up my mind?"
527600, "By tomorrow, Lara, as far as making up your mind goes. As for the dying, it will be when the time comes for your sacrifice. So do you agree?"
527601, "I agree."
527602, "And you won't go back on your promise tomorrow?"
527603, "No. Don't you trust my word?"
527604, "I do, Lara. Farewell."
527609, "So you're expecting to be sentenced to death... Tell me, would you like to die the same way as your father, Captain Ravel?"
527610, "If my death cannot restore his good name-then that's how I'd like to die."
527611, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527612, ""

527614, "Yes. I cannot lose."
527615, "Aspity, listen to me. I am the harbinger of your death. You can choose what it will be like."
527616, "Isn't that a little presumptious? I may yet be the harbinger of yours..."
527617, "Depends on what you choose. Would you like to go back into the Earth that you came from, as ashes, bones, and mud, for a shabnak to be moulded out of them later?"
527618, "Doesn't sound too tempting. Still, it's in your power... Mistress. Are there other ways?"
527619, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527620, "What does Simon have to do with it? A human who tried on the head of Bos will forever remain human... even if the head did fit. I'm already flesh of his flesh. Are you going to give me his blood too?"
527621, "I can see in your eyes that you know the answer already."
527622, "I do. Well, such is my fate, it seems. Will the sacrifice be made the moment you lay your hands on me?"
527623, "I won't let you get away. So do you agree?"
527624, "Do I have a choice, Mistress? I can't escape you..."
527625, "You do have a choice. The sacrifice must be voluntary, or it will be pointless."
527626, "I agree regardless. I like this finale. It seems quite natural."
527627, "You're scaring me. It's the outcome no-one has been able to predict."
527628, "Depends on what you choose. Would you like, instead of returning to the Earth, to dissolve into the people of the Kin and serve Burakh, its new Foreman?"
527629, "Hey! That sounds attractive. Yes, I'd prefer a death like that to any other. Was it your doing?"
527630, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527631, "Pointless bravado! Or are you trying to save face?"
527632, "No, not at all... Well then, let's get started. Will I have time to curse you before I die?"
527633, "Yes."
527634, "Tell me what you want from me."
527635, "Still, tell me, Aspity... Are you really Earthborn? Are you really a magical being fashioned from clay?"
527636, "Am I really being asked this by a Mistress? Now what could I answer that would comfort you... No, of course not. I was born and have lived for all these years as a human. Or maybe not-maybe I've turned into one... I've changed. I was just trying on your laurels. I was, if you like, a kind of vicereine while you were absent. A changeling."
527637, "A sly answer... And ambiguous."

527639, ""
527640, "I feel uneasy..."
527641, "Everything will be fine."
527642, "Katerina! Listen to me. I am the harbinger of your death. You can choose what it will be like."
527643, "Let me take a good look at you again, my dear girl... Yes. It's all happened as preordained... And not at all as I anticipated... Yet again, I have nothing to reproach fate for. All the signs are in place. A young Mistress... My successor... How must I go?"
527644, "Would you like to die as a criminal ruler that led thousands of people to their deaths with her false prophecies?"
527645, "No. I wouldn't..."
527646, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527647, "And I shall depart into the land of shadows not as a fiend fooled by a rat, but as a martyr who has paid for her sins with blood that can heal? I agree. It's a dignified death. Do what you must."
527648, "It won't happen right now. But soon enough."
527649, "Whatever you say, my dear girl..."
527650, "Do you agree?"
527651, "I do. When you become their ruler-be kind and fair. Stay true to yourself. Don't take the path Nina took. Work your miracles if you can... And don't yield to temptations."
527652, "And you won't go back on your promise tomorrow?"
527653, "Of course not... silly girl..."
527654, "Till tomorrow then, Katerina!"
527655, "Would you like to die as a martyr and a champion of faith? Would you like to save thousands of lives instead of the thousands of lost lives you bear the blame for?"
527656, "Yes. I would..."
527657, "I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527658, "CROWBAR. Looters use tools like this to break into bolted houses."
527659, "No! I've changed my mind! Forget we ever had this conversation!"

527666, "Listen to me... I am the harbinger of your death. You can choose what it will be like."
527667, "Yes. Everyone must pay their dues. It is fair that you should be the one bringing the news. I have betrayed and renounced you."
527670, "It will. I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died-if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst."
527671, "How will it happen?"
527672, "Every drop of your blood will be turned a medicine that can save the town. You will have accomplished your mission as a ruler."
527673, "It is the best death I could wish for. Better than the most humane mercy."
527674, "So you agree?"
527675, "I agree. And I am grateful to you."
527676, "And you won't go back on your promise tomorrow?"
527677, "Of course. And now excuse me, Clara; I'd like to be alone."
527678, "Farewell."
527682, "Sleep... father-as I so wish I could call you!"
527683, "Why did you do that?"
527684, "Because I had seen in you a sign of my defeat. It was no coincidence that you came to our house: the girl that doomed our entire town. I made one last attempt to avoid that path. I struggled to be defiant."
527685, "In vain. What's doomed is doomed. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
527686, "You can't say I didn't struggle!"
527687, "No. Only my duty as a ruler compelled me to act as I have. You may not believe it, but over these days I have grown to love you. I have always wanted us so badly to have a daughter... A young Mistress Saburova."
527688, "You deserve to die. And yet I shall give you a death that will end your path as a ruler with honour, and allow you to fulfil your duty."
527689, "Death will be a welcome way out for me. Your solution will be better than a bullet to the head, will it not?"
527690, "Then... perhaps this shouldn't be done. Forget it. I don't want to be the harbinger of your death anymore."
527691, "No. Let's not do this..."
527692, ""
527693, "Now's a bad time..."
527694, "Isn't it always..."
527695, "Listen to me, Stakh. I am the harbinger of your death. And you can choose what it will be like."
527696, "Well, that's fair. Simon's murderer deserves to die. I was going to wait for Maria to reach the zenith of her power-I'm curious what punishment the Mistress would have chosen for me. But I suppose your idea will be more interesting still. There is, after all, a mystical power within you too."
527697, "Would you like to die like Simon died? Would you like to emulate him?"
527698, "That would be most fair. Are you going to lay your hands on me?"
527699, "Yes."
527700, "All right. Just remember you have to work with healthy people. It's important. I'll gladly become your first volunteer. If you find others among your Bound, make sure they're in good health. And if they were sick and have been healed, some time must pass first."
527701, "Why?"
527702, "The cells must renew themselves. It doesn't take long, though. Has the Inquisitor endorsed this solution?"
527703, "I don't know. But I suppose she will."
527704, "Also make sure the Bachelor survives-he knows the secret of the vaccine-as well as Burakh, the Haruspex, who knows how to work with the ingredients. Good. It's a wise course of action. If you succeed and save the town, it will be a genuine miracle."
527705, "Will you stand by these words tomorrow?"
527706, "Of course. Anytime it's necessary."
527707, "Then I'll see you tomorrow, Stakh."
527712, "I've endorsed it, and that's what matters."

527715, "What news?"
527716, "Break a leg..."
527717, "Thanks."

527720, "Soldier"
527721, ""
527722, "What kind of place?"
527723, "I've commissioned my son to take care of it... He'll fill you in on the details and hopefully will even guide you there. He's living in some abandoned wreck by the Station at the moment. You'll find him there if you haven't already."
527725, "Who are these enemies?"
527726, "What do you mean? The Saburovs, of course! Haven't you been told? You'd better speak to my father about that, he'll tell you more of his wreath-bearing counterpart, and more importantly, about his deranged wife, Katerina. My duty is to show you to your new home."
527727, "Well, get to it then."
527728, "Dankovsky? What on earth does he want?"
527729, "Are you bothered that he discusses your affairs with such confidence? I think he got his hands on some of Isidor's documents. Don't forget that, unlike you, he made friends with the Saburovs. Anything that had been found at the scene of the crime could have gotten into his hands."
527730, "I wonder what I'll inherit after that..."
527731, "Even if you only get the still, you could make a fortune with its help."
527732, "Oh really?"
527733, "I will do so then."
527734, "Then look in the Steppe. To the south-west of the Cathedral, to the south of the Station, and to the south-south-west of the Abattoir. It would make sense to go there every day. Twyre is a fickle herb-one day it's here, and the next day it's gone..."
527735, "What are the Gates of Sorrow?"
527736, "Oh... basically, that's what the Kin call the gates through which bull carcasses are carried from the Abattoir to the factories."
527737, "Where is it?"
527738, "Wait for what?"
527739, "I am my mom's heiress. When the time comes, I will take her place and help my people develop and nurture the town. I've told you already, haven't I?"
527740, "Will you become a Mistress like Katerina?"
527741, "Yes... I think."
527742, "No."
527743, "If he told the truth, and the rumour is to become a reality... Lord help us all! It would be better if you two joined forces then..."
527744, "How does the news play into Saburov's hand?"
527745, "The Saburovs have always been running things. They hold executive authority, that is the traditional role of their family. They were not actively needed when everything was going fine, but now his hour has come. I'm sure the outbreak has made him happy! He will make us all remember what the Saburovs' apanages are!"

527756, "What say you, Warden?"

527759, "All right, all right..."
527760, "Nothing."
527761, "You were sent by my father! I know you were. Don't rip me away from my sweetheart-tell father that you couldn't find me. I'll shower you with herbs for that. I'll give you many different ones. I know how to lure them."
527762, "Do you know how to brew them?"
527763, "No... My father does, but he knows very few recipes-and only the simplest ones. He won't tell anyone anyway. Don't expect him to share his knowledge with you."

527773, "As far as I can remember, these twyrine brides nurture the herbs and apparently provide a much better harvest. These brides may be sold and bought, or even borrowed, which is not considered inappropriate. Their odonghe profit from them. So, when this Bog-Worm asks me to bring his bride back, he is simply taking care of business. There is little emotion involved."
527774, "The marsh-dwelling odonghe is waiting for any news concerning his daughter. I wonder how he will repay me for my verdict."
527775, "*** Let the situation remain unchanged. The bride will be returned. The odonghe are an intrinsic part of ichor and sap circulation between the Earth and its children. They do not belong to themselves-and neither do their brides. Private considerations should not disturb the harmony of this sacred communion."
527776, "*** They say that these odonghe Worms take part in the circulation of ichor and sap between the Earth and its children. They do not belong to themselves-and neither do their brides. However, the Earth is wiser than its children. Likewise, the brides are more sensitive to the Earth's requests than the odonghe. If she has chosen to leave, then such is the will of the Earth."

He sent me as a messenger to Aspity, that evil creature that may well be responsible for the pestilence itself. Olgimskys' son Vlad the Younger will advise me the best way to approach her."
527779, "Aspity is certainly not human. Rather, she may be a phantom; an emanation of a collective mind-or maybe collective madness. She is everything the spirit of the Kin rejects. Vlad the Younger believes Aspity is dangerous. It won't be simple to win her favour..."
527780, ""
527781, "I will have to visit the Ripper once more, since Aspity seems to be colluding with him. This couple makes my hair stand on end."
527782, "I can return to Aspity now. I did her bidding, and I deserve a favour in return."
527783, "Everything is going the way it should. Each event is a sign; no incident is coincidence. Every messenger is an envoy of the higher powers. The role of a judge scares me more than death itself, but if I refuse, someone else will pass judgement in my place. The consequences would be terrifying!"
527784, "*** Aspity is guilty of letting the disease into the Termitary. She alone is to blame for a single case of sickness leading to a massive outbreak! She deserves to die. From now on an Executor will be guarding the entrance to her house. No one will come to comfort her."
527785, "*** No, Aspity is not guilty of the outbreak. What she believes and what is real are not the same. Whatever horrible deeds she takes responsibility for, I will not be her accuser. She is destined, perhaps, to redeem herself for the evil she has caused."
527786, "'Grace'"
527787, "The husband carries the sword and the wife brings the peace-just like a family in power should. Katerina has entrusted me with an errand. She doesn't want me to punish, but to pardon instead. The first person I need to take care of is Grace, the daughter of the cemetery keeper, who I met yesterday. Lara Ravel would know how I could get Grace to like me."
527788, "I need only to find a flower, some milk and a loaf of bread. This will be enough to please Grace."
527789, "Our conversation was rather awkward. I should go back to Katerina now."
527790, "*** Grace is with the Humble Ones now. In these days of terror she will be protected by the power of truth and no evil will be able to touch her."
527791, "*** I couldn't change her. Grace remains the same... Did I do the right thing or was I confused by fear? Why am I so worried about her?"
527792, "'The Living'"
527793, "Lara Ravel's associate went to investigate the dangerous house. What reason could that Harpist have to go there? I hope he doesn't bring back something evil."
527794, "The deed is done. I am suspicious of the Harpist, but I can't yet say whether he is guilty or not. I'll let him go for now, but I'll visit him again in a few days... In the meantime, I can return to Lara."
527795, "*** Did I win Lara's favour? I don't know. Besides, I don't like this 'House of the Living' at all. For some reason I don't believe her plans will ever bear fruit."
527796, "The door was open."
527797, "Could you be more precise?"
527798, "The menkhu are those who know the lines of the body. Those who have the right to make cuts. Those who know how to disjoint joints in a way that pleases earth."
527799, "Yes. I'm the eldest of my kin now."
527800, "True. I know of such things."
527801, "Correct. You know the answers to my questions."
527803, "Why would I do it?"
527804, "Okay. I believe you."
527805, "What's a shabnak-adyg?"
527806, "A demonic creature made of clay, bones, and blood. It looks like a person stuffed with bones. The Steppe belches it out from its depths when Earth needs a weapon to fulfill the original design."
527807, "Tell me about yourself."
527808, "Are you joking?"
527809, "Sometimes."
527810, "Can I trust you?"
527811, "Tell me about the Kin."
527812, "The Kin are your people. The children of Boddho, the steppe people that work here day and night. It is from their flesh and blood, as well as from the bones and skins of the bulls, that the town is being built-for several generations now. The houses grow from their bones and the trees are fed with their sweat."
527813, "How many of them are there?"
527814, "Eighteen hundred of them are currently working at the Abattoir. Eleven hundred more are odonghs who herd bulls in the Steppe. Twenty four hundred handle carcasses for Fat Vlad at the Works. Many more have assimilated with the regular townsfolk-the people that arrived here after the Fire."
527815, "The Fire that the Termitary was built after?"
527816, "Exactly. The Termitary that is now locked-boarded up from the outside. Its doors and windows are guarded by Olgimsky's armed henchmen. But that won't last for too long now that you’ve come."
527817, "What does it have to do with me?"
527818, "Why are they called Worms anyway?"
527819, "Well... Worms are also the children of Boddho, just like men. They are simpler, but closer to Earth. So they feel the soil better, they know the gentle words to caress the herbs. Twyre has a very distinct growth pattern, you know. Each stem has its own name and personality. You need to get to know it. Nourish it and cherish it."
527820, "What does white whip do?"
527821, "White whip is always a mystery. It's almost impossible to find it on your own, by the way, you'll have to talk to the Gatherers about it. As for what properties it adds to an infusion... I don't remember. You need to know the recipes. A lot depends on the blade, too."
527822, "Why?"
527823, "Each blade has its own personality, that is known. All of them are different, but the blades of each kind of herb have something in common, too. So even if you don't know how a particular blade grew, you can still risk making an infusion with it. It will have an effect."
527824, "There's no medicine in drugstores?"
527825, "You can come across some drugs from time to time, but they're of poor quality. Someone's bought up the whole supply recently-and I've heard it was a single person, too. I wonder who would do something like that... that information could be of use. Twyre is of course no medicinal herb. Earth does not serve man; man serves Earth."
527826, "Indeed."
527827, "I don't think so."
527828, "What is the First Outbreak?"
527829, "Stanislav Rubin-he was one of your father's apprentices, by the way-told me that an outbreak of a mysterious disease had already happened once in this town, an outbreak that bore many resemblances to the one that killed Simon Kain."
527830, "Go on."
527831, "The disease had spread through one of the poorest districts back then and was only miraculously contained. It was only raging for two or three days, but the memories it has left are still soaked with fear so strong that... well. What I'm saying is Isidor's inheritance may very well be of use."
527832, "I'm not sure about that..."
527833, "Just the core ideas, I don't need to study them in detail. Neither do I want to. I don't believe in folk medicine. My professional assistance, on the other hand, could prove useful to you; I do, after all, know how biochemical reactions work."
527834, "So?"
527835, "Curious. So Isidor Burakh relied on some sorf of... natural agents? He abstracted the working components from them somehow, I guess...? Or even used those agents to obtain serum from blood... Damned if I know..."
527836, "Come back to me after you get it; I'm sure we'll have a very lively conversation then. I have a strong suspicion you are about to stumble upon quite a few mysteries, and that I could shed some light on them. Will you come?"
527837, "I will."
527838, "Maybe."
527839, "Now I feel like a truly rich heir."
527840, "I can't promise you anything. I'll just take a look."
527841, "There will be a reward. Your reward. I know secrets. I know how to combine the herbs so that they'd sing together. Sing in unison, not out of sync. I'll tell you one or two."
527842, "Yes. She remembered her duty."
527843, "Her word and my word are kin. She says she will come back, so she will be back. I said I would give you a secret, so I give what has been promised. It's a lost secret anyway, the apostate has run off with it. A non-secret. I give it to you. Keep it well. Those who lose secrets, die."
527844, "Probably."
527845, "A bad choice. Neither here nor there will herbs multiply. This year will become the last good year, no more good years to come. Herbs will fade, the body of a disobedient daughter will fade. Her smooth breasts will dry up, her warm milk will dry up."
527846, "Don't condemn your daughter. You will come to regret it."
527847, "It's all for the better."
527848, "What do you want?"
527849, "I am a Gatherer, and I am an oynon. I am known for my wisdom, and I have the knowledge of herb conjunctions. My daughter is a Bride, she knows how to summon herbs from the Earth. She does it well too, just look at how generous a summer we had! I've sold my daughter at a good price, I've sold her to as a wife to this Gatherer."
527850, "What price did you sell her for?"
527851, "We have three young ones, three Gatherers. She ran off for one of them. One is to the right, across the Gullet; one is to the left, across the Guzzle. If you find her, if you make her obey my word, I will reward you. I will share a secret of herbs. Two if you insist."
527852, "He is a hero. He has dealt with the traitors, with the apostates. He has returned them to the Earth, the people who have been selling my secrets to outsiders. But my daughter didn't come to his house as a wife. She doesn't want to bring him riches, she doesn't want to summon herbs for him."
527853, "What do you want from me?"
527854, "That was her choice, and I can get behind that."
527855, "So she doesn't listen to you but will listen to me?"
527856, "You are a Warden. You know the lines. Tell her that this is where her line of fortune lies. She will listen."
527857, "Is that him over there? An unusual choice..."
527858, "I see."
527859, "...You are a menkhu. You know the lines. Fine. I will follow. Let me say my goodbyes, and I'll come."
527861, "No. I can read the lines of your fortune. You have to follow them."
527862, "There was a brand, wasn't there? And the documents bearing the same mark... that designates a secret name."
527863, "Indeed. How do you know that?"
527864, "I believe in you."
527865, "You could get out of here when it's dark."
527866, "I haven't quite got the hang of it..."
527867, "I need it so bloody much! How did you know?"
527868, "What is it about then? Allow me to kindly remind you that there are a lot of people here who do not shy away from piercing others with knives in the street! Yet during an emergency the people who look more or less modern and civilized are disallowing me, a fully-trained medic, to dissect bodies!"
527869, "They won't let you dissect the dead?"
527870, "It's an ancient tradition. Its roots are religious in nature. Or even mythological."
527871, "Bloody brilliant! Well, I don't profess any local religion! I'm fighting an epidemic. Or rather I'm trying to save a couple thousand people even though they turn themselves inside out doing their best to get in my way!"
527872, "Wait a bit..."
527873, "We run, no stops, time is short. Hopefully we don't run into them on our way... You'll probably fight back well enough though."
527874, "My name is Sticky."
527875, "Nice to meet you."
527876, "Hmm... Do you know how to get in there or something?"
527877, "Nope! And I'm a master of this trade, y'know! It's embarrassing... I'm Sticky by the way, you may have heard of me."
527878, "I'm Burakh. Isidor's son. You have heard of him for sure."
527881, "What's so costly about it?"
527882, "The... the field gear. Trust me, I'm not trying to swindle you."
527886, "What kind of a payment is that?"
527887, "It's all in the interests of the scouts who make the map, Burakh. They're being threatened. They get killed by precisely those people, the barbers. Get it?"
527889, "No, to hell with that."
527890, "Can you imagine? The Skinners district is completely empty! No disease there anymore-like there's never been any. Weird, right? Sticky is on cloud nine, no doubt about that! I'm worried about him though..."
527891, "Interesting... What does the district look like now?"
527892, "No."
527893, "All right, I've changed my mind. How many crowbars did you say you wanted?"
527894, "Four will do. Chances are it's as many as there are. Four men have definitely been seen."
527895, "Fine. Wait for me."
527896, "Here you are. You meant these crowbars, right?"
527897, "Yep, just the stuff. I'll keep my word. Here you are. Our potluck, as they say..."
527898, "Thank you. Hang them up on the wall."
527899, "Crowbars like these?"
527900, "Gee! Ain't you a fast fellow... I'll keep my word. Here you are. Our potluck, as they say..."
527901, "Thank you. Hang them up on a wall."
527902, "Marauders all over the place! Houses are still standing unlocked, just like they were yesterday! So they're grabbing what they can! I bet they're going to gang up together soon. Killed a good fellow not too long ago, they did, and Wrick's big brother as well. That's who I'd like to go to war with!"
527903, "Why so bloodthirsty?"
527904, "It's not blood but justice I'm thirsty for. They go around killing people-and evil must be repaid with evil. We'd love to go there but... there's business to be done. And now I'm worried about Sticky-he wouldn't think twice before crossing them! Have you thought about giving them a thrashing?"
527905, "There's a good chance I'd end up as the thrashee..."
527906, "They say they've got these totally awesome crowbars-nicked them from the works. I can offer a bounty on every marauder-this I announce publicly. Whoever brings four marauders' crowbars will get... well, I'll reward them well, that's for sure."
527907, "Yes, they probably deserve to be fought with."
527908, "An intriguing proposal. Consider it accepted."
527909, "No thanks. I will do without it."
527910, "I'm no fool to waste my time like that."
527912, "How?"
527913, "They say the Sand Pest is so terrible that it makes people die of pain. They feel like they're drowning in boiling oil. Giving painkillers to these poor souls is a dangerous and perhaps even heroic feat. Go to an infected area and help the agonizing!"
527914, "Who is Sticky?"
527915, "Well, there's this guy... Haven't I told you already? He's always looking for trouble. We aren't friends or anything, but I do have a lot of respect for him."
527916, "So what's going on in that district now?"
527917, "I know that already. And?"
527918, "Break a leg to you too."
527919, "Rubin's made a discovery about you. You should see how they're fussing now! Walking about and bribing the kids and sending out messengers. As if we were on the eve of a battle, no less. And it's all to do with you."
527920, "Why do you think so?"
527921, "They're all Clara this, Clara that, and how it'll be the worst thing in the world if you slip away. Two of the lads have heard Rubin and the Bachelor having an argument about you-so heated they almost got into a fight."
527922, "What do they want from me, anyway?"
527923, "Who's 'they'?"
527924, "Well, Rubin, Burakh, the Bachelor, the whole medical bunch. Didn't they tell you anything?"
527925, "No."
527926, "So they're being sly about it. Probably want to con you; or they'd have got in touch with you long ago. Or have you been hiding?"
527927, "I haven't!"
527928, "I have."
527929, "Pity about the 'almost'."
527930, "I'm telling you, Stakh Rubin's found out something about you. Or maybe you've done something nasty? Not that he'd be in a position to judge you if you did... Pot calling the kettle black and all that. Same goes for the rest of those gentlemen... And you, what do you think?"
527931, "I'm going to find out what's going on."
527932, "Well, I've warned you, so my work here is done. Will you join our gang?"
527933, "I might."
527934, "No. I won't."
527935, "I'm studying you."
527936, "What are you up to?"
527937, "Me? Nothing special. The only thing of interest that's keeping me here now is the role Rubin's discovery will play in determining the fate of the Polyhedron."
527939, "Gone to The Crucible with the good news. And considering that the only good news as far as the Kains are concerned would be that Simon was still alive, he probably knows how to resurrect Simon and save the town from the Commander's cannons. Otherwise, it's suicidal."
527940, "And what do I have to do with it?"
527941, "I don't know. I think you're part of his calculus. Clara, could he be counting on your help in implementing his plan?"
527942, "I know everything."
527943, "Really? Then will you perhaps explain me everything? Because I'm still in the dark. Rubin's been postponing the explaining until after his theory's proven."
527944, "Where is he himself?"
527945, "What discovery?"
527946, "Rubin believes he has uncovered your secret. He reached that conclusion after studying the inner structure of Simon Kain."
527947, "And where is he himself?"
527948, "Suicidal? Why?"
527949, "Because the glorious Kain clan's cards have been reshuffled. Georgiy and Victor have faded away: family tradition requires them to perform some kind of a duty that will soon, if not already, result in their demise. Maria's calling the shots now."
527950, "Does she have a reason to dislike Rubin?"
527953, "And when will Rubin be back?"
527954, "Quite likely never."
527955, "I can foresee that she'll have a reason to dislike his discovery. Maria is quite content with the way things stand now. If Georgiy and Victor sacrifice themselves to the memory of their departed-guess who gets to rule?"
527956, "Why?"
527957, "Does this mean Rubin knows how to bring Simon back?"
527958, "Simon is not simply dead; he was pulverized into atoms, and drops of him are now coursing through the veins of several hundred people. Even a miracle-worker can't resurrect someone who's in this state. Which means that Rubin is proposing a half-measure that will hardly impress Maria enough to make her refuse."
527959, "Will you go with me?"
527960, "I see..."
527961, "If you're interested to know what Rubin has found out about you, you'd better hurry."
527962, "And you?"
527963, "I have other plans. Rubin is doing one stupid thing after another. The fact that he's relying completely on you but still hasn't let you know about it, is more proof that Rubin is primarily seeking to atone for his wrongdoing against the Kains. I wouldn't want to interfere."
527964, "We have transferred our power to her. Or do you doubt her entitlement to it? The process has already begun, and it is irreversible. Let her judge! With her inner eye, she sees what Georgiy and Victor can no longer see. They are not their own masters anymore."
527965, "Where?"
527966, "'They'? Who?"
527967, "Georgiy and Victor. Are you not listening to me, little girl? Ha ha ha ha ha!"
527968, "Who's inside him? What devilry is this?"
527969, "Who is this speaking? Who are you?"
527970, "And who are you? Ha ha ha...! You are in no position to ask such questions! Get out. I'm sick of you already."
527971, "Oh my..."
527972, "'Yes. But he was taken away on Maria's orders."
527973, "That I do not know. Or care to know."
527974, "And who does know?"
527975, "My daughter, I suppose. Maria is in charge of everything now; she gave the order."
527976, "Why is Maria in charge now?"
527977, "'What did he talk to you about?"
527978, "'Where?"
527979, "'I don't know. I don't concern myself with such things. Perhaps Victor will know more. Or it was Maria's own decision. Apparently they've taken all of our servants off their duties for that-I've been trying to summon the couriers for half an hour already!"
527980, "'Did he say anything about me?"
527981, "'He proposed interesting things... He declared that Simon was not lost to us... which I knew already, of course. He said that Simon had been precious to him not as a person, but because of the prodigious powers he possessed... powers that can supposedly be brought back to life in another human being. It was then that he mentioned your name."
527982, "'Why?"
527983, "'That I do not know. Our conversation was interrupted by Maria. Her powers are growing by the day. She didn't believe him and went on to accuse him of sacrilege. She called you, Clara, a spawn of hell. Maria said that whoever would talk to you would be talking to death. Is it true?"
527984, "'So who will have to part with their life?"
527986, "'Maria! Don't you decide who speaks and who remains silent in here?"
527987, "'Maria has long been waiting for her time to come. Soon she will ascend to power and become the Mistress of Flames, as her mother once was. The blessed, blossoming Chaos, a nourishing source of growth, creativity and love, the gracious womb of a future life... Maria will overpower the pestilence and restore the city."
527988, "'Why did she accuse him?"
527989, "'Rubin spoke with passion, with fury even-and the sum and substance of his speech was that we don't have to take pains and part with our lives in order to preserve the Memory of Simon. She didn't like the idea... After all, it involved Nina too. Maria had loved her mother quite madly."
527990, "'Why aren't you afraid of talking to me then?"
527991, "'Because I am already dead."
527992, "'What does that mean?"
527993, "'And you? Why not you?"
527994, "'Because two souls cannot survive for long in a single body. Do you not feel it yourself? You of all people ought to understand it with the utmost clarity. It's a state that corrupts both the soul and the body. A great soul needs an appropriately great receptacle. An incorruptible body."
527995, "'I think I'm beginning to realize who's standing before me..."
527996, "'Simon, Simon! I know that you-"
527997, "'No. I will not talk to you. You are yet to do many things that ought to be done without my involvement. Be free."
527998, "'...All right."
527999, "'A curse upon you!"
528002, "'Don't say a word of this to anyone."
528003, "'How did you manage?"
528004, "'You could never do anything of the sort. Nor should you. What you see before you has only a few more hours to live. This frail vessel cannot withstand such internal pressure for long. Whatever Rubin had in mind, it wasn't this."
528005, "'I'll try to find him regardless."
528006, "The sentiment is mutual."
528007, "Tell me where Rubin is and I'll leave."
528008, "Such a shame! I'm losing strength by the minute... And all of the servants capable of bearing arms are off taking Rubin away-or else I'd have made short work of you!"
528009, "But why?"
528010, "The two of you are in it together, aren't you? Yes, he said he was going to carry out his bloody plan using your hands. But don't you worry; when my domestics are back I'll send them after you immediately!"
528011, "That's slander!"
528012, "The hell you will!"
528013, ""
528014, "Move it! Place is closed!"
528015, "What happened here?"
528016, "About time too..."
528017, "The architect has been convicted in a court-martial and executed by firing squad, for armed assault on a patrol guard. Go away, girl!"
528018, "...Where did it happen?"
528019, ""
528020, "Who are you? Are you here on an errand?"
528021, "No! I'm Clara. I heal people."
528022, "Why aren't they ordering retreat?"
528023, "Perhaps because we ought to hold out."
528028, "So you're that girl? And they said you were scary ugly."
528029, "Idiot!"
528030, ""
528031, "Deftly done! I suppose I shouldn't ask too many questions. Thank you. Are you a sister of mercy?"
528032, "Thank you!"
528033, "You ought to take cover."
528034, "You should better leave too."
528035, ""
528036, "I'm not talking to you, Changeling. And I'll advise my brother against it too."
528037, "I just need you to tell me a few things about the Polyhedron, Andrey."
528038, "You can see for yourself that it's the acme of all human achievement. The Tower is no chimera, no oddity, no trick-whatever heartless Daniil might think! It was made for people; it is needed by people; it has no meaning without people!"
528039, "Why the shouting? Why are you so passionate about it?"
528040, "So you don't trust me? But I've changed..."
528041, ""
528042, "The Bachelor will tell you everything... I can't talk right now..."
528043, "What is it, this Polyhedron of yours?"
528044, "Why would I talk about it? What do you know about miracles? You say that you can perform them yourself, that you are yourself a power capable of making miracles an everyday occurrence; well, others aren't like that! Rarely do we get a chance to make the impossible happen."
528045, "I want to save your Tower..."
528046, "I see you don't trust me..."
528047, "'The Bound'"
528048, "The Inquisitor was surprised, but still willing to hear me out. This is good, for I won't manage without her support. However, in order to secure her friendship I first need to bring her the head of Bachelor Dankovsky. An enormous price."
528049, "The Bachelor went to visit the soldiers. He seems troubled by what is happening among the military. However, I don't think he was able to sneak by the Commander... I wonder what is happening there right now?"
528050, "Dankovsky is trying to rescue the architect, Andrey Stamatin. He was captured by the mutineers who took control of the field gun."
528051, "I must heal the dying officer. He is the only person in this abyss who knows what has happened to the Bachelor."
528052, "The officer is saved. He is breathing; his heart is beating."
528053, "The Bachelor can be found in Peter Stamatin's workshop."
528054, "The Bachelor is willing to help me. He values these kinds of alliances dearly, it seems; he has asked me to bring him Burakh's head."
528055, "Burakh says I should bring him the head of the Foreman."
528056, "Finally, the lines did meet. The first of the fallen Bound ones, that monstrous Foreman-who won't hesitate to give his life-has recognised the Mistress of the Earth in me. He is willing to sacrifice himself for the possibility of a miracle. I can return to Burakh now, I have freed the subterranean throne for him!"
528057, "My plan will come to fruition. I was capable of taming the demons, even though their hatred for each other remains. I can return to Aglaya Lilich now."
528058, "This is the end. Aglaya commands me to leave the town at once. But why? What's wrong with my strategy? Is this because my plan answers the goals of the Powers That Be too well... What kind of an Inquisitor is she? She is nothing but a vengeful, malicious impostor! What can I do now, but collapse at the feet of the Commander and beg for protection?"
528059, "The final journey lies ahead. It is time to reap what was sown. The Foreman was the first sacrifice. Six more are needed. Seven sinners would be enough to save the town."
528060, "I still require five Bound ones willing to give their lives for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before."
528061, "I still require four Bound ones willing to give their lives for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before."
528062, "I still require three Bound ones willing to give their lives for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before."
528063, "I still require two Bound ones willing to give their lives for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before."
528064, "I need one last Bound willing to give his or her life for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before."
528065, "This is the end. Aglaya commands me to leave the town at once. But why? What's wrong with my strategy? Is this because my plan answers the goals of the Powers That Be too well... What kind of an Inquisitor is she? She is nothing but a vengeful, malicious impostor! What can I do now, but collapse at the feet of the Commander and beg for protection?"
528066, "*** The preparations are complete! Tomorrow, the miracle may come to pass! I would be happy beyond measure, were it not for this awkward premonition that freezes my heart still... I can perform miracles! Just let me..."
528067, "I'd advise against it. Doesn't lend itself well to a long life."
528068, "A prisoner has been brought here recently!"
528069, "Were you among those who accompanied Rubin?"
528070, "Yes. I was."
528071, "How did you get here?"
528072, "I was covering the retreat of my comrades. And I'm proud of it."
528073, "No. Where is it?"
528074, "A cellar under the Rolling Mill. Look here, I'll show you."
528075, "Yes. I'm sure I do."
528076, "Has a doctor, Stanislav Rubin, been brought here? He was likely accompanied by several armed people."
528077, "Yes, indeed. A giant of a man dressed in leather. He was dragged along by twelve people. Was he really a doctor? What had he done to earn such honours?"
528078, "Yes, he's a doctor! What's happened to him?"
528079, "They demanded in an insolent manner that we place him under arrest. I prohibited that and demanded an explanation from them; I ordered all of them brought here. They refused. A gunfight ensued. We shot four of them and captured three. The rest managed to vanish with the prisoner amid the commotion."
528080, "...May I talk to the men you captured?"
528081, "You may. I will issue an order to let you into the jail. But be careful; they say it's dangerous inside. Infection."
528082, "Why do you need him?"
528083, "He promised to say where Rubin had been taken."
528084, "Yes? Let him speak while facing the barrel of a rifle. Why release a dangerous rascal with violent proclivities?"
528085, "I've promised him freedom."
528086, "He wouldn't talk. Pride."
528088, "Certainly."
528089, "Thank you!"
528090, "Go to the prisoner. I'll order him released."
528094, ""
528095, "Here you are, sweet child. I've heard a lot about you. So you are the girl who's cured dozens of people with her holiness, while also being persecuted and hounded for it by the unruly rabble?"
528096, "Yes. That's right."
528097, "The base rabble always trample what they don't understand. Always repay for a heroic deed with ingratitude. They ought to be spoken to in a different language. And I swear they will be! From now on I'm not letting you out of my sight. You need reliable protection."
528098, "There's no need for that! See, I'm unharmed; that's because I'm invulnerable."
528099, "I won't allow anyone to harm you."
528100, "No one's ever said anything like this to me before..."
528105, "It's not their fault! They just mistook me for someone else."
528106, "That doesn't excuse them in the slightest."
528107, "Besides, they were frightened..."
528108, "Thank you."
528109, "It's all because of me! He discovered a way of saving people, that was however unprofitable to those he trusted!"
528110, "That explains a great deal. In any case, those who brought him in didn't exactly strike me as pleasant people. I even had to resort to harsh measures."
528111, "What happened?"
528112, "Can't you see yourself? I was walking out of my lair... Was passing by this workshop when I heard a noise, and there were those six or seven men dragging Stakh away. I had to take on them... Sadly, I didn't help Stakh in the end. Couldn't push my way through to him."
528113, "They've taken him again?"
528114, "Yes... and got away. I was pinned down by three of them... or was it four? The others took him away... I gave them quite a thrashing but got roughed up myself. Looks like a damaged knee and a broken ankle... But perhaps it'll be all right... I just wish I could get Stakh out! Could you tell... Vlad the Younger, at the very least?"
528115, "Where have they taken him?"
528116, "Could the Bachelor help?"
528117, "Perhaps I should tell Grief?"
528118, "No... That one's shrewd... and has plans of his own. Which apparently don't involve Stakh anymore... He's become useless to everyone... no one even remembers it was him who made the vaccine! He let the Bachelor take all the credit so that he had something to brag about in front of Aglaya... So that's that."
528119, "I'll go myself. Don't worry, I'll manage. Where could they have taken him?"
528120, "Is that the one where the Theatre is?"
528121, "Yes. I can guess why-there's a certain place there... I wandered into it once, a maze underneath the Knots... Vlad the Younger had made one of the creepholes when he dug his well, and the other one was on the rear side, behind the Theatre... It was there that I saw that creature... that apparition. The Rat Prophet."
528122, "Why would they go to the Theatre? It's been turned into a hospital... of sorts."
528123, "The Theatre's most likely run by Maria... The place is hers. She's in conspiracy with Mark. So she had them go there."
528124, "The Rat Prophet was there?"
528125, "Yes."
528126, "Did he show you the way out?"
528127, "I'm not the Plague!"
528128, "I choose the past."
528129, "I always choose the future."
528130, "Careful, it may be a bad call... What do you need Rubin for?"
528131, "I'm going to decide his fate. As was preordained."
528132, "I need his help."
528133, "Rubin rests underground-and it doesn't seem like he's getting out of there any time soon. Are you sure you want to join him?"
528134, "You know, I've been thinking about you all this time. Do you know what your hands are capable of doing?"
528135, "Yes. I work miracles and heal the sick."
528136, "You transform blood, Clara. You could turn any of the Bound into the kind of being that even Simon was not. I don't know how it happens, but your hands enrich a person's blood with corpuscles that don't occur in ordinary people. This blood can fight the disease."
528137, "Perhaps..."
528138, "This means that if we agree, we can defend the town from both the disease and the army cannons. Here's a way. You can transform Bound volunteers. Their blood will then be spent to make the panacea. It's cruel, but some of the Bound will agree."
528139, "So the town's going to turn into a kind of shrine demanding continuous sacrifice?"
528140, "Isn't it all the same to you, Rubin?"
528141, "Yes. I bring death."
528142, "Now listen to me. Burakh has uncovered the secret to his father's panacea. He was running short on blood; he'd looked everywhere but couldn't find a being whose blood would combine all the necessary qualities. Blood that could stop the bacteria from multiplying and smother the disease."
528143, "And so my hands create that kind of blood?"
528144, "Yes. Simon, the all-but-perfect human being, had the same blood. But it was weak. Simon was very old. In all the other respects, his blood was like what Burakh sought after. A holy blood, which he still desires, still tries to wrestle from Foreman Oyun."
528145, "What does this mean?"
528146, "Why do we specifically need the Bound?"
528147, "I suppose the predisposition in their blood was what made them Bound in the first place. Perfect people with perfect blood. We have to find volunteers among the Bound who'd sacrifice themselves. Simple people from the street won't do; that's been verified."
528148, "Miracles violate the world; they're abusive in nature. When the world was conceived, it was conceived as a coherent whole, without contradictions. Harmony is the main, indeed the only component of any Universe. However ugly a world may be, however unfair it may seem-it is nonetheless harmonious!"
528149, "Look around you! Or is this what you call harmony?"
528150, "And who do you think you are, daring to interfere in a supreme design? What could the consequences be of your meaningless actions?"
528151, "I..."
528152, "Driven by either compassion or anger, you've had the audacity to tamper crudely with the finest fabric of creation, severing and rebinding threads that aren't for you to sever or rebind, it being the prerogative of a thousandfold greater mind than all of our paltry ones combined!"
528153, "You..."
528154, "And yet I hope that you're highly overrating yourself. There's a different account of the same events, isn't there? Equally convincing arguments have been put forward in support of the claim that you are disease incarnate-its personification, such as have been known throughout history."
528155, "That's not what I am!"
528156, ""
528157, "Bring her in, let me take a closer look at her... Well, I've expected more than this. Much more. You look nothing like a messenger of the Supreme Power. So how can you prove you're a true miracle-worker, and not just an unsightly changeling pretending to be one?"
528158, "My deeds speak for themselves."
528159, "All that your deeds suggest is that you're a dangerous fraud. Is anyone prepared to vouch for you-other than the Bachelor, who you could easily have swayed?"
528160, "The ones I've cured."
528161, "Commoners? And who's going to go around looking for them amid all this chaos? It's certainly beyond my resources. Well then? How do I know you're you?"
528162, "But such things need no proof..."
528163, "Look at me and you shall behold."
528164, "Ha ha ha... Who do you fancy yourself? Now this is too much. There is no need for such comparisons. But perhaps you're just insane?"
528165, "I don't know..."
528166, "All right, your word will be enough. Make a statement, then. Enunciate your identity. Who are you?"
528167, "My name is Clara. I am the Miracle-Worker."
528168, "I am Clara. I am a barb on the tip of the Spear of Destiny! Beware of me, inquisitor!"
528169, "If someone dares to condemn me-I will bring my witnesses!"
528171, "Who's deceiving me? Do you mean the Saburovs? "
528172, "No. The Powers That Be. They deceived you, like they did everyone else. The Saburovs are also victims of their scheming. They, the Saburovs, wanted to use you to strike at the disease carrier. But you shouldn't have killed anyone. No member of the Circle is to blame for the outbreak. The logic of the world is. Such is the Law."
528174, "...I made the sister up. I never had one."
528175, "My oh my... You know what, tell me about your past, girl. Who are your mother and father, where are you from? What did you do before you came here? Who saw you on your way?"
528176, "...I can't. I don't know who's acting under my guise right now. I can only feel their hands."
528177, "...So you won't tell? Then I will. You are insane, my child. Deranged. You have a split personality disorder. Schizophrenia, perhaps. What you think of as reality is sometimes replaced by an illusion, to reappear in its true vivid fullness later. A nice version, isn't it? An all-round nice one! The only thing it can't explain is your still being alive..."
528178, "Yes, we have things to talk about..."
528179, "And mind you, I need you here with a report before the end of today! Or else I'll kill you."
528180, "What have I ever done to you?"
528181, "I've been sent here to smother the disease and reinstate the Law. Plague or miracle-worker, in my eyes you're a menace either way. I won't go soft on you. Remember, I'm keeping you on a long leash."
528182, "I won't! They're my mother and father..."
528183, "Oh yes you will. Have they not betrayed you? Have they not disowned you? Have they not thrown you out of the house they had told you earlier to call your own? Some parents! Don't deny it. I know everything."
528184, "You're leaving me no choice..."
528185, "Possibly."
528186, "Of course you have. I'll tell you a little secret: there was no way you could have failed at it."
528187, "How is that possible?"
528188, "So what happens now?"
528189, "I'm going to give you three tests. I'm going to send you to the three grimmest loci in this town, the foundations of the three pillars its mystery rests upon. Three symbols, representing the three worlds it's made up of... Your encounters with each of the three will reveal your essence in its fullness."
528190, "Don't be baffled by the oddness of the tasks I'm giving you. I'm going to watch your behaviour. Just act naturally, and I'll observe and draw conclusions. You've already almost completed the first of my tasks."
528191, "I don't understand..."
528192, "Do you know who the Powers That Be are?"
528193, "Why do you have so little regard for the Saburovs?"
528194, "I see..."
528195, "You don't need to know that. The Powers That Be are those who sent me and the Bachelor here-along with one more queen piece, a proud rider on a fire-breathing steed. He's already near. You'll meet him yet."
528196, "And why did they deceive everyone?"
528197, "They'd like to preserve this town. In the exact state it's in now. It's critical to them."
528198, "Why?"
528199, "You see, there are beings who think on a wholly different scale. For them, the country consists of towns and cities, not people. And then there are those for whom the world consists of continents, not towns and cities. But one has to give it to them that this town deserves special treatment."
528200, "By virtue of what?"
528201, "Take a look at it. Look at its tight and harmonious blend of every era of humanity. Its reflection of every facet of human existence. Its well-proportioned combination of good and evil: a straight footpath between heaven and hell."
528202, "That's true of any town."
528203, "A smart observation-and yet this town manifests it particularly vividly. So vividly that, for all its provincial ugliness, it can aspire to become a magical model of the universe. It's destined to become a warning. A pretend-play rehearsal of our eventual common fate."
528204, "Now I understand..."
528205, "Because I don't like presumptuous fools. Human lives are valuable to me. To this day, I've been paying for my kind-heartedness."
528206, "You shouldn't blame them... They did what they believed to be their duty."
528207, "What will you task me with today?"
528208, "You've mesmerized people before, with quite some success. This really speaks in support of your being... exceptional. Today you're going to test your powers on a monster. You will meet Oyun, the Foreman of the Abattoir."
528209, "Is he not human?"
528210, "An equal blend of human and beast. As I understood from esteemed Boös Olgimsky's account, his father had been begotten on a Steppe woman by a bull. He is thus a chimera... a vivid epitome of this town. If the town were to get a coat of arms, the Foreman should be on it."
528211, "My God..."
528212, "Find out whether he is guilty. Also try to assess how much of a threat he is."
528213, "A threat to what?"
528214, "To whom, rather... To the one who will have a lot of dealings with him. To sum up, I will need a psychological portrait of this... being. Gain his trust and learn as much as you can."
528215, "Aren't you afraid that I could deceive you?"
528216, "I'm not. I would learn a great deal more of what I need to know from your deceit than from your honesty, with a few added touches to your own portrait. By the way, let me tell you a little secret about yourself, the first key to unravelling your mystery. You are entirely incapable of deceit."
528217, "How am I to get inside the Abattoir?"
528218, "These passages open and close at random, as if controlled by a kind of paranormal sphincter. It looks like a hole, but no human can get through: the mental barrier is impassable even to me."
528219, "What conclusions have you drawn from my behaviour yesterday?"
528220, "You are not as simple as I thought."
528221, "Does it mean my execution is being postponed?"
528222, "For a bit."
528223, "What do you want to task me with now?"
528224, "Does that mean I'm a Mistress?"
528225, "The only one around who could be described as a 'mistress' is, at the present moment, me."
528226, "How am I to get inside the Abattoir?"
528227, "So what am I supposed to do?"
528228, "Find a girl at the Termitary who goes by the name of the Mother Superior. Come up with something to make her let you pass. I suppose you'd handle a small child without any difficulty. However, I wouldn't advise you to try your spells on her. She's Steppe-born, and a special kind of Steppe-born... Not a good idea."
528229, "...I think there's another one you didn't mention."
528230, "Don't try to be clever. If you're going to the Abattoir, go. If you aren't, good riddance. Your disappearance will make a lot of things simpler. And it's inevitable, if you don't go to the Abattoir. A matter of hours."
528231, "Seen him and lived? Let me take a look at you... Widen that pupil, look into the light... So what did you talk about?"
528232, "About Burakh..."
528233, "About Burakh... Good girl. Stick your tongue out and say 'arhh'..."
528234, "Arhh!"
528235, "Why?"
528236, "Not at all..."
528237, "Dismissed. Come and see me first thing tomorrow morning."
528238, "He's afraid of him..."
528239, "That means he's not as dangerous as I thought. Thank you, you did well."
528240, "To the Kains? No, I'm not going! They hate me..."
528241, "Oh, poor dear... They hate you? Really? I'm beginning to feel for you. But don't worry. You're now under my protection. They won't dare harm you. Avoid Maria, though... The niece is unpredictable."
528242, "What? What did you say?"
528243, "Quiet. Don't be so twitchy. Then, find out from them how to get inside the Polyhedron, and do. Once you're in there, do whatever you want. In short, it's the usual thing. I'll find out what I want to find out one way or another."
528244, "May I ask you a question?"
528245, "A single one."
528246, "All right. I will do it all."
528247, "What do you need this for?"
528248, "Firstly, I want to lure the Kains out of their entrenched defences. Secondly, I'm interested in an impartial opinion on the Polyhedron. You ought to agree that the structure deserves some thoughtful studying. Rumour, I presume, is greatly exaggerating its capabilities."
528249, "It is the last test, isn't it?"
528250, "The last but one. Although... we'll see in the evening."
528251, "And what if I refuse?"
528252, "I always speak only the truth."
528253, "Here, take some money. You might need it. If you're arrested and convicted, I'll know. Then I'll try to arrange for your life to be spared."
528254, "By what means?"
528255, "If you really did spread the disease, I'll ask for you to be taken to the Thanatica for experimentation. Perhaps I'll have better luck getting you out of this miracle-abounding hellhole than I did with Simon."
528256, "Is that so?"
528257, "There's no need for that..."
528258, "What do you mean?"
528259, "You'll soon be grovelling at my feet, Executor!"
528260, "What? Who are you talking about?"
528261, "Weren't you trying to get to the Inquisitor just now? I suppose that didn't turn out well in the slightest. You weren't even allowed to present yourself to her gracious ladyship. Be thankful there's no armed guard around the Cathedral right now. They ran off for a moment... to escort you to the gallows."
528262, "That wasn't me. "
528263, "Yeah, I think I'm prepared to believe that now. But who was it then?"
528264, "I need to see the Inquisitor."
528265, "No door will stop me. No hand will hold me back. See? Now you can convince yourself."
528266, "How did you recognize me?"
528267, "It's simple! No other Executor could approach the Cathedral from that direction at this time. You are the Changeling. But don't you fret, I won't turn you in."
528268, "That won't be a long wait."
528269, "How did you recognize me?"
528270, "It's simple! No other Executor could approach the Cathedral from that direction at this time. You are the Changeling. But don't you fret, I won't turn you in."
528271, "Can I see the Inquisitor now?"
528272, "Come on, come on in... Aren't you afraid?"
528273, "I have nothing to be afraid of."
528274, "A little..."
528275, "Well... that is entirely lawful. What does the Inquisitor want from me?"
528276, "She's ordered me to question you the way I used to question others upon your orders. I'll ask you my way... and you will give answers."
528277, "What is it?"
528278, "I believe the town has been doomed from the outset. And if I'm right, there is at least a degree to which our actions could be justified. So here goes: I anticipate that some very powerful people share my views. Find out one last thing for me: by whom, and with what instructions, were the three envoys sent here. The Bachelor, the Inquisitor, and the Commander."
528279, "The... Commander?"
528280, "Didn't you know? The army is on its way here. They will arrive in a few days. I presume that their commanding officer is under orders to assess whether a total annihilation of our town is in order."
528281, "So the army will level the town?"
528282, "It is clear at this point that all three emissaries are destroyers. Not one of them is even considering the option of preservation and future creative development. Find out, then, what orders these destroyers have been given. I am interested in knowing who instructed these destroyers, and with what rationale."
528283, "Why?"
528284, "Why do you need to know that?"
528285, "Don't you understand? I can die with a clear conscience if I know that those pulling the strings also believed the town to be doomed. Otherwise, I'll go mad. Find that out for me, my child! Then I'll tell you everything, and make you my heiress even as you condemn me to death."
528286, "I don't need to be retold what others had to say. I'd like to hear it in your own words. Well?"
528287, "The town is doomed, father. It's been doomed since the very beginning."
528288, "The very beginning? This town is several hundred years old. And if we include the Kin settlement, it might date all the way back to the creation of the world."
528289, "At least for as long as it's had its present shape."
528290, "What about herbal mixtures?"
528291, "Everything in the world is akin. They just know that-and know how to use that."
528292, "I am Artemy Burakh."
528293, "Oh, I know! You're that terrible killer who everyone's been after these days. The Ripper, that's who you are. Right?"
528294, "No, I'm not a ripper."
528295, "That's right. The Ripper is me."
528296, "Tell me about her."
528297, "She was brought here by a kidnapper eleven years ago when she was but a little child. She's been indulging in every sin possible ever since-passionately, voluptuosly even. It's more than anyone can bear-and so it's time for her to go!"
528298, "You go easy on Aspity!"
528299, "Sorry. Didn't think you two had something in common."
528300, "And don't you worry about her butchers. You'll never have to think about them again."
528301, "Once again, you need my help in killing someone..."
528302, "No! Of course not! I didn't want to. You asked me why I am so sad, so I gave the answer, that's all."
528303, "I'll go there instead of you, come back, and tell you whether it true or false."
528304, "Don't cry."
528305, "I think this show is part of some intrigue."
528306, "Won't I ever hear my mommy then! How much longer do I have to wait? Am I destined to become a Mistress at all? It is I, I that must be responsible for town now, when it is dying! I am an heir to the Light Mistress! How do I cover the town with my wings, when I don't even have one feather!"
528307, "Speak."
528308, "You will be loved. You will shed rivers of blood. You will think hard as to what sacrifice to make. You will inevitably make the wrong choice. You will try to distance yourself from the Bachelor's path and back the wrong horse. Then you will disappear. That's it."
528309, "You're right, I'd rather not."
528310, "I wanted to introduce myself. Looks like it's unnecessary."
528311, "Explain yourself? Your very self? How curious! Speak. I've found myself rather preoccupied with matters of identity lately! Seems like I've abandoned those matters all too early-seeing what they have done to me."
528312, "Our conversation is taking a strange turn..."
528313, "No it isn't. Your father had invited you to his own funeral. And so you arrived-only to find him murdered. You then came into an inheritance, saddled with an obligation to save a creature that you know nothing about by making a panacea; it also warned you of a sacrifice it will inevitably require. Is that correct?"
528314, "It is."
528315, "So, they've made you invent a panacea? An unexpected move..."
528316, "Made me? It was my choice."
528317, "You were masterfully led to this conclusion by the circumstances. You consider the creation of a panacea your principal goal-and do you really believe it was your idea all along?"
528318, "So what am I guilty of?"
528319, "Oh please, no one is blaming anyone here! Who in the world would call you guilty... the Powers That Be tricked you. You were set up. Who led you onto this path? Who was this malicious influence? You are but a pawn in their clumsy hands. A tool for someone else's execution."
528320, "I do as I see fit. I choose my own path. If someone wants to use my choices for their scheming, so be it."
528321, "...That's some nerve. Or am I missing something...? Listen to me, you silly man, you've been played! Manipulated! My position comes with perks-facts, access to information. Don't you believe me? Do you need proof?"
528322, "If someone works my part into their play, that's on them. I am only responsible for my own choices."
528323, "... A worthy answer."
528324, "What about you?"
528355, "One can only get to a bull from one side..."
528356, "Very funny. Tell me, have many bulls died lately?"
528357, "I haven't come across any dead bulls. But it may have something to do with the local customs, the Rite. "
528358, "How do you know that?"
528359, "A little bird told me."
528360, "I see..."
528361, "Are you a fortune teller or something?"
528362, "What are you talking about?"
528363, "I've had a disagreement with the Rat Prophet! And so he's hiding from me now, telling me nothing... And I need to hear a few words from him about me-now that I'm persecuted and hated, I need it more than ever! What is my fortune? What is to become of me? Why have I come to this world?"
528364, "You said yourself that he was a liar. Why do you need him?"
528365, "Oh, I need someone! Anyone! Oh, Burakh! I have helped you, haven't I? You've made another step towards making your panacea, haven't you? Could you help me out too? Do me a favour in return?"
528366, "What do you want?"
528367, "Let's outsmart him! Go see him as though on your own, he won't say no to you. Pretend to hate me and ask him about my fortune! What happens to me tomorrow? But most importantly-who am I...? Why have I come to this world...? Got that? Will you help me?"
528368, "He lives under the Theatre-or even inside it. Burakh, Haruspex, sir, please, please be kind, please get to him! Oh, if only you knew how I suffer... I'm lonely and in pain..."
528369, "No, Clara. You're on your own."
528371, "He said that you are the personification of the plague. A she-plague. A creature of darkness."
528372, "Oh God... Really... Are you telling the truth? Could he have lied to you?"
528373, "You are a supernatural being, Clara. You serve... the forces of good."
528374, "I see."
528375, "Please do make haste. You will have my eternal gratitude. It's not that far-you can see the tombs from the window."
528376, "I haven't faced them for you."
528377, "Really? Seems like your bravery dwarves your good manners. Allow me to say my goodbyes."
528378, "With pleasure."
528379, "I'm all ears."
528380, "I've heard an enraged mob was planning to desecrate the Mistresses' tombs. And, well... you see, I disobeyed doctor Dankovsky's orders recently and went outside to speak to my mother. Her tomb is the one that's closer to the cape, you must have seen it."
528381, "I don't get it..."
528382, "I brought a gift for my mother then. A diary. A compilation of sentimental memoirs, nothing more, but it's dear to me. When I was a little girl, my mother used to leave me secret notes in it; the letters were seemingly appearing out of nowhere. I believed that the book was talking to me."
528383, "You need this book?"
528384, "Bring me the diary, Burakh! I fear... I fear that the tomb will end up desecrated. I wouldn't want the diary to be damaged... or fall into the wrong hands."
528386, "Why did you take it to the grave?"
528387, "Oh, that look in your eyes, Burakh! Yes, you are quite shrewd-and your assumption is correct. Do not be disturbed though. We, the Kains, have our own way of communicating with our dear departed. In fact, their relationship with the world of the living is much more intimate than is commonly believed."
528388, "So..."
528389, "...That diary could of more value to me than a simple memento. Will you bring it?"
528390, "I will."
528391, "For a price."
528392, "Oh... It was quite unexpected of you to flaunt the price tag. I thought our relationshp was developing so chivalrously... I will reward you, of course. Let us pretend you've never asked for it. It's more fun that way."
528393, "Don't try playing games with me."
528394, "No. I don't want to."
528395, "Find someone else."
528396, "I'm happy to hear you admit that."
528397, "I apologize wholeheartedly. I would much rather prefer peace. I've heard that you've done so many worthy deeds that even the feats of ancient warriors pale in comparison. Are you truly so heroic?"
528398, "In spite of the obstacles you erect in my way."
528399, "You think this is funny?"
528400, "Nay, little one. You'll make me flunk it."
528401, "That is no good! If you refuse to answer, I'll send you away."
528402, "I'll have to remember my student years..."
528403, "I'm not joking! Or don't you see who stands before you?"
528404, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm listening."
528405, "Tell me, how do they call upon the menkhu, the faithful of a Warden kin? Well?"
528406, "'Known by their hands, for they are butchers; known by their eyes, for they are surgeons...'"
528407, "Known by their eyes... eeerr... Something something... Them who are knowledgeable... right?"
528408, "So you do know. Now I'm ready to speak to you. But don't cross me or I could get very very angry very very quickly."
528409, "Bad. You don't know."
528410, "I do, I do. 'They who follow the lines; they who are the leaders of the Kin; they who speak to udurghs...'"
528411, "It's from the Tale of the Sons. I could read it aloud to you later."
528412, "I'm not going to tease you."
528413, "Don't be angry."
528414, "I've heard of them."
528415, "I need fifty vitamin pills. Precisely fifty-five times ten. It's so that those who're planning to go inside don't get infected. Then you shall fall into my graces."
528416, "I need a bull, Mother."
528417, "I don't have a bull right now. They've taken all my lovely cows away from me; the white, the silver, the red-eared, the black-eyed, the tender. They've taken all my bulls away from me; the steel-horned, the copper and stone and jasper-hooved. But I can tell you where to get another bull."
528418, "I won't be able to find that many. Come on!"
528419, "There are no such bulls. I don't believe you."
528420, "Wouldn't they believe me without unnecessary questions? Tell them that you've tested me already."
528421, "No way! Nobody believes you. Perhaps you're not who you claim to be at all. Where did you come from? What if you're the shabnak? Things like that happened before! No, the test is mandatory. Everyone must make sure."
528422, "What am I supposed to talk about?"
528423, "I've got... my own business down there."
528424, "I want to ask the talking rat a question."
528425, "Hm... All right, I understand. Well, shout if you need a rope. But don't expect me to go down helping you."
528426, "You lot still think I'm a murderer, don't you?"
528427, "No... But who else will defend us? It's a nice opportunity for everyone. We'd offer you to scout places with us, but you're nowhere to be seen durigh the day-and I doubt babysitting us is your cup of tea anyway... So barter it is."
528428, "I've come to ask you... about someone else's fortune."
528429, "Well, well... Go ahead. There's no harm in asking."
528430, "There is a girl in the town, Clara. Tell me, who is she? Why did she come to this world? What's to become of her?"
528431, "Oh, I see. So it was she who sent you here. Pfft! Her fault-she should have known it's no good trying to force the development of the plot. I'll tell you who she is. She is, as a matter of fact, the disease. The Sand Plague personified."
528432, "No, I don't believe you..."
528433, "But-heads up!-she doesn't know it. And so she performs miracles, branding herself a miracle-maker-because she believes that she is one. She's got great power in her-everything she believes in comes true. And so she'll forget how to do it as soon as she learns the truth. That's why I'm doing my best to avoid her."
528434, "Who are you?"
528435, "Definitely not who you think I am. Positive about that."
528436, "Are you a prophet?"
528437, "I am a rodent. Can't you see?"
528438, "There is a girl in the town, Clara. Tell me, who is she? Why did she come to this world? What's to become of her?"
528439, "I thought so."
528440, "That is unnecessary."
528441, "At first, the people that had been waiting for the mysterious killer at the Station had hotheadedly mistaken you for one, conferring your features to the person they were after. Then-and this is absolutely your fault-having believed the false rumours, we have accused you of stealing the body of our precious brother Simon."
528442, "Are you trying to say that the ambush at the Station wasn't your doing?"
528443, "Apology accepted."
528444, "It wasn't. By the time the locomotive that had brought you here arrived at the Station, we hadn't given out any orders yet. Few people even knew of the ruler's death. We thought that this ambush was carried out by random enthusiasts."
528445, "No. They acted on the rulers' order..."
528446, "Strange. Something's not right here..."
528448, "No."
528449, "A procession of the infected was supposed to come to the cape sometime during the day to pay their respects to the sacred graves. But we've received news that some murderous blackguards are planning to attack the pilgrims. Have you heard anything about it?"
528450, "No. I haven't heard anything."
528451, "Hopefully these are merely asinine rumours."
528452, "Hopefully."
528453, "Firestarters are indeed running rampant about town."
528454, "Meanwhile my daughter would like to apologize for all the wrongs our family has inflicted on you. I think you should talk to her. Of late, she has been... I have been putting her in charge of making important decisions. She's becoming more and more like her mother."
528455, "Who was her mother?"
528456, "Ah, of course; you're an outsider, aren't you? If you’ve never heard of my spouse, the divine Nina, then I'm afraid it won't be easy to explain how important this is... How much it means."
528457, "How much what means?"
528458, "The fact that my daughter is growing to resemble her by the day. It means that this town will soon have a powerful Mistress who will use her primordial, ancient power that comes from the very depths of the earth to stop this cursed pestilence and revive our town for the glory to come."
528459, "You have a poetic mind."
528460, "Yes. I've been luckier than you."
528461, "But I'm more likely to survive."
528462, "I see."
528463, "At ease, you moron."
528464, "Sorry, sir, I have no idea what you're saying, sir."
528465, "You are not supposed to."
528466, "Are you sure?"
528467, "The government Inquisitor will conduct a swift investigation, find the culprits and make a public example of them. Rightly so, if you ask me, sir!"
528468, "Which culprits? Hundreds of crimes have been committed here recently."
528469, "I mean this jail, sir. There's been a mass imprisonment of innocent townsfolk. Senseless violence; unlawful methods. Criminal negligence that led to the contamination of a cell and numerous deaths. The culprit must be punished."
528470, "And here I thought it's you and the likes of you that are actually guilty of... unlawful violence."
528471, "Not by choice, sir. We were acting under direct orders, sir. We were not ordered to think, sir."
528472, "Now Law shall prevail, sir."
528473, "You are one philosopher, mate. Where's the Inquisitor?"
528474, "I ain't no mate of yours! And stop with the snarling! You ain't my boss! You cooked your own goose-and now you're making fun of an honest patrolperson?"
528475, "Calm down, will you? Where's the Inquisitor?"
528476, "Her Excellency has left for that leech of a usurer's hideout to interrogate him. The one that was at the root of all that arson mess. Well, they'll fashion themselves with hempen cravats now. Arson is bad, mate!"
528477, "Is the Inquisitor in?"
528478, "On business, mate."
528479, "Talk to the head Executor. Ours is a modest role."
528480, "Why are you here?"
528481, "The volunteer patrol guard forces have been transferred under the command of the government emissary. We're guarding the place and executing the Inquisitor's orders. So please kindly comply."
528482, "I need to see the Inquisitor."
528483, "We were late. We came when it was all over. She dealt with the attack, ordered to seize the Hunchback, and went away."
528484, "You wanted to kill her?"
528485, "No, of course not! Killing an Inquisitor...? Hah! What for, anyway? We're not killers. We wanted to expose her true intentions! A plan exposed is less than half a plan."
528486, "I wish you luck."
528487, "Uh huh, I see..."
528488, "You are one naïve young man."
528489, "You students..."
528490, "How is it strange?"
528491, "Well, for one thing, Aglaya Lilich is my late wife's sister. We could think ourselves lucky-were it not for an old mutual grudge between the sisters that persisted despite the difference in age. It's a terrible, hopeless feud that even the elder sister's death has done nothing to assuage."
528492, "It is a coincidence."
528493, "I fear that too many personal interests will get in the way of Aglaya's duty here. None of these personal interests... being remotely favourable for us. I think Aglaya Lilich regards this expedition as a mere pretext for revenge."
528494, "Since when are Inquisitors allowed to have feelings?"
528495, "Some are. You see, it's only getting stranger from here. I've been informed of another strange detail by a person from the Capital who I trust. According to him, the High Tribunal of the Inquisitors' Collegium has sentenced Aglaya Lilich to death."
528496, "What?"
528497, "There are three possibilities here. One: my information is incorrect. Two: she has come here of her own accord, having disposed of the real Inquisitor and usurped their authority. If anything, she has nothing to lose anymore... But that's too hard to believe."
528498, "Well, what about the third possibility?"
528499, "The third, and most likely, possibility is that the Powers That Be have granted Aglaya Lilich a last chance to redeem herself-by giving her an all but hopeless mission. It makes sense; her chances of survival here are quite low to begin with. This version seems to be the best one for us... and the worst one for you."
528500, "Why?"
528501, "Because the last thing she needs is competition, my friend. An Inquisitor's job is to find a bold solution to an impossible problem-a solution so smart, so outside-the-box, that its very outlandishness (provided, of course, that it proves efficient) would more than justify their acting with impunity. That's why they are needed in the first place. You've robbed Aglaya of the chance to prove her worth... and I'm afraid she is already aware of that."
528504, "I'm no competitor to her."
528505, "What about your panacea? The Bachelor has told me there's only one tiny step left for you to make. If that is not the solution to the problem, what is? Were it not for these unfortunate tribulations poor doctor Rubin had to go through because of us, you would have created it already, wouldn't you?"
528506, "No. I wouldn't have."
528507, "Well... Then you can stand before the Inquisitor with a clear conscience. You won't be able to avoid it anyway-unless you're considering fleeing the town, of course."
528508, "I'm considering nothing of the sort."
528509, "She is probably already at the Cathedral. All I can do is wish you luck. Fortune has been kind to you of late-perhaps it will continue to shower you with its abundant gifts. If you go to the Cathedral, I'd say the odds of your survival and non-detainment are three to seven."
528510, "Is it true that the Inquisitor is planning to have me killed for my invention?"
528511, "Upon whom?"
528512, "Upon my late wife and her elder sister... Or rather what's left of her."
528513, "Who would allow an Inquisitor to use their mission for setting personal scores?"
528514, "Not a 'who'. A 'what'. Despair. I have recently come to know that Aglaya Lilich has been sentenced to death... for her affinity to schemes and hidden agendas, dare I add. Only a miracle can save her from the scaffold. It's easy to get carried away in a situation like this. One may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb."
528515, "How could anyone have assigned a mission like this to her then?"
528517, "I fear no one."
528518, "Is she still here?"
528519, "No. She went to the town jail. And she was sooo angry! She's ordered to unlock the Termitary! Said there was no one there to escape anyway..."
528520, "What else did she say?"
528521, "Said she'll punish those who are responsible for this big time. It won't be easy to find out who's to blame, I told her. She'll crack the puzzle though, I think."
528522, "I thought everyone knew who issued the order to lock the Termitary up."
528523, "Well, I don't. But the guest said she would find out. Ugh, she's so menacing! All I wanted was to shrink into a very very tiny little thingie-that's how scared I was... And I'm not one to get scared easily!"
528524, "How will it make them come to harm?"
528528, "A sacrifice was made yesterday-and who do you think they used? A Supreme, a Bos Primigenius went to the slab! Everything was supposed to change... yet nothing has. It means the Warden is a false one!"
528529, "What Warden?"
528530, "Foreman Oyun. It was he that opened the Supreme up. But nothing happened! The plague didn't stop! Perhaps he's simply a bad Warden? Otherwise the lines would've extended. The sacred blood of the Supreme would have cured the world. But no such luck!"
528531, "So the Foreman is back?"
528532, "Since last night. That's when the Supreme was brought in from the Steppe-right through the Gorge. He was sooo huge! I've seen a Supreme's shadow for the first time in my life! And my odonghs keep saying it will be the last, too..."
528533, "You wouldn't happen to know as to how I could get to the Foreman, would you, Mother Superior?"
528534, "Tell me, Mother, do you know what the 'udurgh' brand means?"
528535, "Kind of. I've seen this mark. It means something really really big. Like a mountain, maybe?"
528536, "No, it's not a mountain."
528537, "Maybe it's the earth?"
528538, "Hardly."
528539, "Weird... Maybe it's the people?"
528540, "Do you know, or are you just guessing?"
528541, "I don't know the letters all that well. I haven't been taught yet. But I know that it's something either very very big, or very very important! See that angle?"
528542, "Is it alive?"
528543, "Probably. See the horns?"
528544, "Can anyone tell me more about this brand?"
528545, "Only a Warden can. Too bad that we don't have any menkhus left, they're all dead. And the odonghe that know it have all gone off into the Steppe. They're preparing for a very important festival."
528546, "Too bad indeed..."
528548, "Why?"
528549, "So what do we do?"
528550, "The Worms opened a bull up yesterday too, you know! And they claim their sacrifice has made a difference! Is that possible? It's just idle talk, I think... and it'll do them more harm than good. Perhaps you could find out what they've done? They're on the upper floor of the Short Block, hiding from the wrath of the Kin."
528551, "To fulfil what was preordained. It is not forbidden. Even children are allowed to do clay-moulding. Fill Bos Turokh's belly with Suok's gruel, and evil will go."
528552, "Has your sacrifice made a difference in the world?"
528553, "We've summoned a colossal envoy from beyond. It's unlike us. It's not human."
528554, "A non-human?"
528555, "The one that we have summoned is destined to restore justice. To fight Suok. To be felled by a Warden's hand. To become the true Sacrifice."
528556, "Who is he?"
528557, "We do not know."
528558, "Could it be the Inquisitor?"
528559, "So you haven't desecrated the Rite?"
528560, "Wait! Why are you saying this?"
528561, "Because that is what's written in The Tale of the Sons. Their death will achieve what yesterday's one hasn't. The one we have summoned was needed, and so they have come. We have done a good deed."
528562, "We would not dare, oynon. What for? We do not know how. We were doing a good deed."
528564, "That's interesting... Go on!"
528565, "Tell me."
528566, "You are to call me Elder One. You have been brought up away from the Vein of Boddho, yet you have decided to come back. You are nothing here until the Kin takes you in. Obey the customs. Obey the Rite. Obey the line of succession. Obey."
528567, "Who killed my father, Elder One?"
528568, "Silence! Who gave you the right to ask me questions without my permission?"
528569, "...The one who sent me here, Elder One. I do it in their name."
528570, "Then ask."
528571, "Tell me what an aurochs is."
528572, "'Aurochs' is the name given to a Kindred Bull by merchants of old. We call him Bos Primigenius to honour the knowledgeable one that had shown him to us."
528573, "You are Oyun, a menkhu and the Foreman of the Abattoir."
528574, "What does the 'Udurgh' brand mean, Elder One?"
528575, "I have no intention of obeying you!"
528576, "You have chosen your fortune. Get out."
528577, "My free will means more to me."
528578, "I know of that name."
528579, "He is Mother Boddho's flesh and blood, his form congruent to the Universe!  His lines are the lines of the world. There is nothing in the world that is not contained within the body of a Supreme. His white flesh tells the march of time; his blue flesh rules waters and rains; his brown flesh keeps the heat in."
528580, "So you've opened up a Supreme not so long ago, haven't you?"
528581, "I have, as was my right. Who else but I, a Warden, the Foreman of the Abattoir, is to open a Supreme's lines up?"
528582, "Give me a gulp of his blood."
528583, "You are impudent, son of Boddho. Aren't you pushing it?"
528584, "That is a foreign name from a dead language."
528585, "I am aware of that."
528586, "'Aware'? What are you aware of? Are you aware that his ribs are mountain ridges? That his skull is the firmament? His juices are rivers. His hair is herbs and grass and roots. His voice is the song of Boddho, his seed the joy of Boddho's Vein, his black blood the time and memory of our Earth. Are you aware of that?"
528587, "...You're faltering already. Even I'm aware of that."
528588, "Who directed your steps?"
528589, "The Inquisitor. The emissary that came to the town last night."
528590, "The lines of my fortune direct my steps, Elder One."
528591, "I act in the name of the one who sent me. You know what Emissary came to the town last night."
528592, "I know that all too well. Let it be so then. I will give you as much blood as you can carry away in your cupped palm. This is the price I am willing to pay to buy us peace and get rid of the emissary. I know neither of you nor of your name, and so you will get not a single drop more. Give me your hand!"
528593, "How much blood do you have left?"
528594, "You have asked too many questions, Kindred One. Be on your way."
528595, "Yet you haven't answered."
528598, "What reason does the Inquisitor have to take your life?"
528599, "The Inquisitor has no power over me... although... they do have power over everyone. They need not concern themselves with legal details. If they need to kill, you die. If they need you to go, you go. They know the ways. But that's not what I'm talking about."
528600, "So what is it that stands between you and your victory?"
528601, "I've failed to find the source of the disease. And yet it keeps coming... from somewhere. There is a will behind this. But I've failed to find the carrier; moreover, it doesn't feel like that's a matter of time. It's like the carrier isn't human at all..."
528602, "Funny. I keep coming back to the same problem..."
528603, "And so I won't be able to make a panacea. You said that we could try artificial synthesis, didn't you?"
528604, "No, it's useless... and impossible without Rubin anyway."
528605, "Perhaps there is another way for me to fulfil my duty. If only I knew whom my father had marked with the damn sign!"
528606, "Oh... Have you given in to despair? Whoever this mysterious patient is, there's only one thing that can save him-the panacea. If it's not too late, I mean. So many have died..."
528607, "What are you talking about then?"
528608, "I've made up my mind. If I am not to go back victorious, then I'd rather blow my brains out with this very revolver. I'm cornered. I'll never be able to look the people I've failed to protect in the eye. My allies will end up in prison or exile, my research... in fire."
528609, "That was not the chimera I had in mind."
528610, "What's happened to Stakh?"
528611, "He turned himself in to the Kains yesterday. I don't know whether he was counting on Victor's compassion or Georgiy's common sense, but-against all expectations-Maria was on the throne at the time. I don't know any further details... What I do know is that no one's seen Stakh since."
528612, "Which one then?"
528613, "If only I knew whom my father had marked with the cursed sign! I need to go to the Abattoir right now. To talk to the Foreman."
528614, "I need to go to the Abattoir now. To see the Foreman."
528615, "The Abattoir is off limits. You won't get in there unless the Inquisitor lets you. It's the Inquisitor who is now in charge of fighting the epidemic... and everything else."
528616, "I can do just fine without it..."
528617, "You're going to need their clearance for movement anyway. I advise you receive it sooner rather than later. If your ill fame precedes you... well, it would be better if you came on your own volition. Outrun ugly rumours and let them know that you're dissecting bodies for a reason."
528618, "And so the only thing left for me is to fulfil my father's duty. But who was it that he vowed to save even if it cost him his family's honour? I don't know..."
528619, "Well, I need a hybrid of man and bull. A chimera..."
528620, "Will you come too?"
528621, "I will go there. Not with you though. Go, I need some time to collect my thoughts. And, Burakh... I'm glad we haven't had time to become enemies. Good luck."
528622, "Good luck to you too, oynon."
528623, "The envoys have turned into destroyers against the will of those that sent them here. The Powers That Be only want one thing, and that's to preserve the town at any cost."
528624, "Have I answered your question, father?"
528625, "...Which means that I am beyond forgiveness."
528626, "Have I fulfilled your task, father?"
528627, "Yes. Spare me your formulas. I will answer your questions candidly and without prejudice. Everything is seemingly self-evident anyway. War crimes and crimes against the state are the only kinds of crime that warrant the death penalty without the need to worry about a possible judicial error."
528628, "Why do you blame yourself for what's happened here?"
528629, "If anyone is to blame for it all turning out this way, it's me. The ruler is always responsible for the suffering of the populace. I bear no blame for the outbreak of the epidemic-but the blame for the devastation it has wrought upon our town is mine and mine alone."
528630, "True. You are beyond forgiveness."
528631, "A force like that is impossible to oppose."
528632, "You may convict me now and hand me over to the Inquisitor. Katerina and I took council last night. We had foreseen this outcome. Yet my wife believes that you'll gain much more if you keep us alive for now. You will soon need people who are prepared to die."
528633, "Wh-what?!"
528634, "Have you talked to Katerina yet? Talk to her. She still bears you no ill-will. And now her goodwill is no longer mudded with considerations of either power or duty. We are both prepared to die. And another thing; the Rod is open to you just as before. Goodbye."
528635, "I know."
528636, "It's not over yet."
528637, "Something phlegmy."
528638, "Are you sure it was the right gatherer? Their faces are so alike... if you can call them faces. Fronts of their heads."
528639, "It was the one. No mistake."
528640, "All right. Do you need money?"
528641, "The very thing. Are you surprised?"
528642, "Not in the slightest. It will fit you very well."
528643, "A little. Never thought they would be in such demand now."
528644, "So you wanted to ask about something sensitive?"
528645, "Tell me what led to your being sent here."
528646, "Ah, I'm making no secret of that now! I can barely stop myself from grabbing passers-by by their collars and torturing them with my terrible tale!"
528647, "Do you think the Powers That Be knew all along that the town was doomed?"
528648, "Compassion? Not really. In fact, I was looking for you."
528649, "Now that the Inquisitor's here, I have more work to do. Can't waste my time on something so trivial. But I have to keep my word."
528650, "Is that how one gets rid of competition around here now?"
528651, "Give it to him yourself-I'm not your courier!"
528652, "Nonsense. Just fulfilling my moral obligation towards that esteemed... gatherer. So-will you do it?"
528653, "Sounds like another of your intricate plots..."
528654, "How tragic!"
528655, "Yes. I promised to compensate the gatherer for his loss, as I feel I had been partly to blame. I was meaning to send him some money, but then the inconsolate widower asked for a weapon. If you give this to him, you'll get precisely the sum I would've given him."
528656, "A twyrine bride?"
528657, "Indeed? Why not?"
528658, "This town is a most unfortunate synthesis of irreconcilable opposites. They're gnawing at each other, coupled forcibly by an extraneous will like two of the same pole of a magnet. Spirit can't be contained by everyday-life matter. The town may have nurtured a miracle into existence, but it must be released now. And here, as you can see... Aglaya is right!"
528659, "And what are her instructions?"
528660, "I don't know. But I can give you a tip. She's been surprisingly forthright with the Haruspex. Ask him; perhaps he'll share her confessions with you. I don't suppose the feelings have been mutual."
528661, "So now we're talking feelings? Interesting! How did that happen?"
528662, "It was during the interrogation. She declared that he was no more than a pawn and an instrument of her retribution. But Burakh's manner was so dignified that she was touched. He impressed her so much with his adamancy that nothing came of the interrogation in the end. The roles were almost reversed."
528663, "What, you were there when she interrogated the Haruspex?"
528664, "Stay away from me, you slob!"
528665, "Don't you know... The Haruspex."
528666, "A man covered head to toe in blood."
528667, "Ah! I see. What did he say? It doesn't work out?"
528668, "He asked me to give you these vials."
528669, "That's exactly what he said. 'It doesn't work out...' In short, he's betrayed you."
528670, "So there are still honest people... Not everything is lost in this world, then."
528671, "Flesh devours flesh. Pray, Worm."
528672, "Ay. Dunno how to fire it, but it'll be useful anyhow."
528673, "Yes! And may every bullet hit its mark!"
528674, "Press the barrel tight against your stomach. Then pull here."
528675, "Of course! At least we don't have to be enemies over this, do we?"
528676, "What is it again?"
528677, "What? The Bachelor wronged them?"
528678, "Does it sound crazy to you? Why on earth? It shouldn't. After the raid, he had promised to get their father out of jail. But I suppose he then had more important business to attend to. The man died in custody along with dozens of other innocents."
528679, "And how are you planning to help them?"
528680, "Give them these five vials, will you? They're an extract of... well, you don't need to know. You see, I can't leave this place. I think I now have a chance to create my panacea before the day ends..."
528681, "How wicked!"
528682, "Where do these people live?"
528683, "I don't know. But they were supposed to come to my cellar. They're probably waiting for me there right now."
528685, "Do you need an Executor's cloak?"
528686, "How did you know?"
528687, "Look at me. What did the Inquisitor tell you?"
528688, "You and your questions... I can't just go and reveal other people's secrets. Especially not to you."
528689, "I'm only interested in one thing. Those who sent her, what do they want?"
528690, "Ah... Well, there's an underhanded game going on there. The Powers That Be are playing everyone at once. Killing several birds with one stone. For every single thing that misfires, they have a backup plan. They turn every failure to their advantage. This woman is one of those stones. It doesn't matter what the stone hits. Those are just her suspicions, though. I might even say her epiphanies..."
528691, "So Aglaya Lilich was a stone they threw right at the town?"
528692, "The Powers gave her hypocritical orders. They need this town with all the warts that have grown upon it. They're interested precisely in this living mutant. But to preserve all of it is a task as amoral as is it is impossible. Which is why they're disguising this objective as something else. In short, they utter one command and imply another."
528693, "And why is preserving the town amoral and impossible?"
528694, "Not the town. The town proper ought to be saved all right. But in their parlance, 'the town' means this entire order of things. This pump that sucks half-humans out of the ground, who then feed children to that horrible tower over there. The envoy thinks this system is doomed. Hence the ongoing disaster."
528695, "And what about the Commander? Did she talk about him?"
528696, "What Commander? Commander who?"
528697, "So she had that epiphany in your presence..."
528698, "Yes. Exactly. I was impressed too."
528699, "She must be very unhappy... Right?"
528700, "Did you like her? An elegant woman, isn't she? And interesting..."
528701, "I believe I've answered all of your questions. Mind your own business."
528702, "And so the Inquisitor's going to defy her orders and cut into the town's living flesh?"
528703, "Seems like it... sort of. But I'm not entitled to an opinion here."
528704, "She turned out to be bitter and proud, right?"
528705, "Do you love your town, father?"
528706, "The Inquisitor is convinced that it's unnatural."
528707, "An unnatural town? And yet it embodies the entirety of the logic of human Existence! Its animality evolved into its humanity, and its humanity gave birth to its superhumanness. A desire for miracles, an endeavour to achieve the impossible... are inherent to humans. However ugly the particular form they might take. Who can dare deprive humans of a dream?"
528708, "Oh... So you have your doubts?"
528709, "Have you talked to the Inquisitor? I've heard she cleared you of all charges..."
528710, "Yes. For some reason, it didn't take her long to stop doubting my innocence."
528711, "No. She said time would show whether my persecution had been justified."
528712, "Well... The tide has turned. The Saburovs have been stripped of power. When one falls from a great height, one cannot but fall to one's death... We have been given very little time to... transfer our power. Both the Power of the Sword and the Power of the Spirit."
528713, "What now?"
528714, "Maria? She'll tear me to pieces!"
528715, "She will not dare... She'll know who I'm referring to. She has been studying you from afar for a long time now. An act like that would shake the foundations of our little cosmos... The balance between the three nodes must be maintained... She won't dare upset it."
528716, "But who was the Saburov Mistress before you?"
528717, "There was one... Don't ask for her name. Go now! Don't you dare hesitate... This is an issue I cannot resolve on my own. Fear nothing."
528718, "What are they saying?"
528719, "They said they'd recognize my power-but not my sister's."
528720, "Well... So be it. Is there something you wanted to ask me?"
528721, "Tell me, Katerina-was it of your own volition that you, the Saburovs, abetted this terrible pestilence?"
528722, "There is nothing to tell. Everything is clear. I never had the power. I am not a true Mistress. I lied... but not for gain. Merely because I wanted so much to be like them. No... wishing for a miracle is not enough to become a miracle-worker... Thank goodness you aren't my natural daughter."
528723, "It's not your fault..."
528724, "Well then. It's your fault!"
528725, "What can I say..."
528726, "I'll tell you just one thing... trust me on it if you can trust me at all anymore. Leave me and my husband alive for a while; we won't last long anyway. We'll be useful to you in the end."
528727, "No, that will not be!"
528728, "How?"
528729, "You're going to need a Bound following... people whose entire inner nature, whose blood, cells, hearts, and livers will acknowledge that they've lived a bad, sinful life, and that only with an act of sacrifice will they be able to atone for the evil they have committed."
528730, "They won't acknowledge my power, but they will acknowledge my sister's. It's her that they will accept as Mistress of the Humble."
528731, "Katerina, I know of you-"
528732, "Why are you doing this? Could I ever deceive you?"
528733, "Tell me, was it of your own volition that you, the Saburovs, abetted this terrible pestilence?"
528734, "Why?"
528735, "Is she? That has long been overdue. An event like this means the Inquisitor's arrival was worth the wait indeed... In whose favour?"
528736, "Certainly not yours, Maria!"
528737, "God... do you really think I would claim the mantle of the Mistress of the Humble? That's a role better suited for you."
528738, "You do talk to Simon, don't you? Ask him if he agrees with you there."
528739, "You're a funny girl... He doesn't exactly appear before me in the mirror, you know! It's only in scary tales that spirits talk in hollow voices from under the ground. But here's the good news for you: Simon really can testify... about the Mistress of the Humble."
528740, "How?"
528741, "Just like that... You see, it's strange that Simon is still alive. Diffused, as it were, within the town itself. We can feel his presence. He claims it's you who are making this possible."
528742, "How can he, if he doesn't speak?"
528743, "We're all busy thinking now how to reassemble his spirit, particle by particle, and saturate it with life. Then he'll say more. Off you go, girl-we won't hurt you anymore, what with Aglaya's orders too..."
528744, "I'll soon start speaking to you as an equal."
528745, "Katerina wants to know what Simon is saying about it."
528746, "I'll make you answer for everything when the time is ripe."
528747, "No. I do not speak with her. My powers aren't strong enough for that yet. But mother talks to me sometimes."
528748, "Has she ever spoken of the future Mistress of the Humble? Of the Mistress of the Earth?"
528750, "She is."
528751, "At any rate, nothing is going to happen while Katerina is alive. It's not a throne. One cannot sign away the spirit to someone else... But it probably won't be long... Let's just hope she doesn't get you mixed up and accidentally hand her lyre over to your Dark Sister..."
528752, "Yes. Can you feel it?"
528753, "HERBAL RECIPE #1. One stem of black twyre, then one stem of brown, then add two stems of swevery. 100 to 9."
528754, "HERBAL RECIPE #2. Two stems of black twyre, one stem of brown twyre, bind with a swevery stem. 64 to 3."
528755, "HERBAL RECIPE #3. One stem of brown twyre, add a stem of bloody twyre, two stems of swevery. 56 to 9."
528756, "HERBAL RECIPE #4. Two stems of black twyre, one stem of brown twyre, bind with a stem of white whip. 32 to 1.5!"
528757, "HERBAL RECIPE #5. One stem of brown twyre, add two stems of swevery, seal with a stem of white whip. 80 to 7.5!"
528758, "HERBAL RECIPE #6. Nice and simple. Two stems of black twyre, one stem of brown twyre. 32 to a mere 3."
528759, "HERBAL RECIPE #7. One stem of black twyre, two stems of brown twyre, one stem of swevery. 92 to 24."
528760, "HERBAL RECIPE #8. One stem of black twyre, add one stem of brown twyre, wrap with one stem of swevery. 52 to 9."
528761, "HERBAL RECIPE #9. This is the damn recipe that started the trading of gatherers' secrets! Two stems of brown twyre, add a stem of swevery and a stem of white whip. 80 to 15."
528762, "HERBAL RECIPE #10. Three stems of black twyre; add one stem of brown twyre. No swevery and no white whip, but nevertheless, a whole 38 to a mere 3."
528763, "I want to talk to you. Will you answer my questions... candidly and without prejudice?"
528764, "No. I won't say anything. I'm the kind of condemned man who doesn't need a confession."
528765, "That's wrong. At a moment like this it's good to unburden your soul, or else you could lose it altogether..."
528766, "'Charon'"
528767, "Vlad the Younger is drifting towards the Utopian heresy, but he is not yet a full-blown fanatic like the twins. He is the heir of a very powerful family though, and it will be a disaster if he pleads allegiance to Maria. Hopefully Capella will be able to advise me what I should say to get Vlad's ear."
528768, "The sister has provided me with the hooks that I need to catch her brother. Now I know how his conscience may be dragged out; he will have no other choice but to listen to me."
528769, "Does my reputation precede me? The moment he saw me, he accepted the tenets of the Humility and condemned himself to die without judgment! I should return to Katerina... If with a heavy heart."
528770, "*** They have rejected me; disowned me and expelled me! Something went wrong. It is as though someone has travestied my ways; as though I was mistaken for somebody else! I feel I am going to die today, for there is no reason why a false messenger should be allowed to walk the earth. "
528771, "I trade in souls-and I take them free of charge."
528772, "Your good faith won't fill a thimble. You know neither trust, nor belief, nor faith."
528773, "...Speak."
528774, "There's a trophy lyin' in Barley's lair, a sack-just make sure you don't open it or look inside, kiddo... Weasel your way into Barley's trust, eh? Then steal that bag, bring it to Saburov 'n tell him where you found it. That's it-'n the town becomes one cutthroat lighter!"
528775, "That's a lot to do..."
528776, "'N keep your pretty lil' mouth shut, will you? Dontcha mention you're doin' it for me, eh? If you doubt my word, you can ask Barley if it was his doin'. Then go ahead."
528777, "Aren't you afraid of making a bad bargain?"
528778, "...Huh? Wha-?"
528779, "You heard me. Look me in the eye!"
528780, "Quiet in there...! What on earth are you babblin' about, lil' pimple? Bet you don't know neither."
528781, "Look me in the eye, Grief. Or do you think I'm joking? Bow to me, for I am your mistress."
528782, "Ooh... I didn't mean to anger anyone! Just let me leave."
528783, "Well excuse me, but there's no 'us'; there's you and there's me. Don't act like I'm one of your kind, thief."
528784, "You'll soon start calling me something else, Grief. For now, though, I forgive you. 'Sister' it is."
528785, "I am way out of your league, you thieves."
528786, "Goodbye, beast. I don't need that."
528787, "What danger are you in?"
528788, "The Bachelor will kill me today... I know that, and I'll let him do it... He believes I'm the disease carrier, the shabnak-adyg. There's no escaping him... He is one of the harbingers of the Fall of the World-the one who carries the sharpest sword in his icy hand..."
528789, "You're looking at me as if I was able to help you."
528790, "Promise that you'll agree to his plan... then he'll leave you alone... And perhaps me as well... I don't want to go... I feel I could be useful to you yet..."
528791, "Don't talk to me as if we were on the same side of the battle lines, spawn of the Earth!"
528792, "You're consoling me. Does that mean you really believe I'm a miracle-worker?"
528793, "You can become one. But it's all in your hands... The greatest proof of your power is the fact that you can choose your own destiny."
528794, "The fury of our persecutors will soon be exhausted! Have patience. For as long as you're here, I too will believe that there's room yet for miracles on this cursed earth!"
528795, "That albino from yesterday-it always appears after dark. Three or so hours to midnight. And today they ran it out of town... The Bachelor attacked him. He had tracked it down, he shot at it many times, and hit it-and now it's leaving... forever..."
528796, "So it's still alive! But how do we find and catch it before it's gone?"
528797, "It is still alive. The Bachelor has hurt it, but it can't be killed... When it appears, it'll be moving outwards, along the Abattoir, towards the Rotten Field. But be careful... what if others also seek to destroy it? What if the Bachelor sets up a raid? There are exterminators in the field, I've seen them with my own eyes..."
528798, "Who? Who are those?"
528799, "They won't listen to anyone, they just keep on scorching... They're surrounding the Abattoir now. I know it's because they're preparing to burn the Termitary; they're looking for pathways to it. But if they run into the magic albino, they'll have no mercy for it..."
528800, "And of course these exterminators would gladly exterminate me too..."
528801, "May it be so!"
528802, "Have you seen that two-legged creature? Supple-necked, white-faced... It looks human, but also looks like it's about to pass into my care."
528803, "Ah! If only we could catch it, so my persecutors would relent..."
528804, "Don't get too excited-I'm looking for him myself! And we will meet again, you and I, I promise you that."
528805, "There's no way you're going to outlive me!"
528806, "You'll be made to remember what you just said very soon."
528807, "Could you actually be that Earthsister who gets in my way every time I'm about to do something good?"
528808, "Shame that this serpent from the Capital didn't get to you earlier! How much longer until you two touch and annihilate each other? The important thing is to make sure you've infected him with your touch before he puts a leaden bullet in your head!"
528809, "No surprise."
528810, "I call myself Sahba-ötün. The Children of Boddho call me Saba Usp'tae. Which the locals here have already corrupted to 'Aspity'. What's your name?"
528811, "Phew... So you're not who I almost thought you were... My name's Clara. But you can call me the Harbinger."
528812, "Clara, huh... Doesn't ring true. That name would better suit some holy martyr than a spawn of deities ingrown in time."
528813, "I'll pay no mind to your words. You're playing with me."
528814, "I'm not the spawn of Evil! If that's the price of your kinship-then so much for sisters... Aspity!"
528815, "...Who is she, this mother of ours?"
528816, "The Earth."
528817, "Who are you?"
528818, "So it actually matters to you what name I'm going to use? All right then... let's say I'm Clara."
528819, "Have you by any chance touched a Bound person with your hand lately? Condemned them to death, or converted them to your wild religion? Those are all touches too. Think about it carefully..."
528820, "I don't know... I don't remember."
528821, "Bulls. Aurochs. Demigodly creatures. Their blood can fight the disease. And if the disease is the instrument of supreme retribution, it means those beings have learned to transcend the supreme laws of this world."
528822, "Are there many of them?"
528823, "I wish we could find more! But Foreman Oyun said this one had been the last. Simon may have been weak, but that aurochs had been strong. If we found the source of such blood, we could accomplish a lot."
528824, "I understand you, Haruspex."
528825, "No."
528826, "It's the local term for people believed for various reasons to be somehow more perfect than the others. They are bound to the fate of this town and the ideal of the Semblant Man, as exemplified in people's eyes by the late Simon."
528827, "Now I understand. They include some of those who the Saburovs suspected..."
528828, "Even if I didn't touch them myself, I know who might have done it for me! It's highly likely."
528829, "Well, their blood was similar to Simon's. Aspity and Yulia-no doubt about those two. Some others too... let me think... also evil..."
528830, "Why is that?"
528831, "You see, Simon's blood bore a weak resemblance to a different blood... as though Simon was the worst in a line of the amazing beings I'm talking about. Yes, his blood could help, were it not so... battle-worn. He was, after all, an old man. That's what I think."
528832, "What sort of beings?"
528833, "How is Yulia evil?"
528834, "Oh, she is. She is level-headed and clever, which is why she doesn't look it-when in fact she was the one who masterminded all that the Saburovs have recently put into practice. She's the ideologist of humility. She came up with a scientific justification of necessary death."
528835, "But what's special about her blood?"
528836, "Repent."
528837, "Go on..."
528838, "On day five, Rubin said that Simon's unique, most singular blood had all been spent-to the last drop. Gone into the vaccine. Then yesterday, the Haruspex made a serum out of blood that was structurally similar to Simon's, even surpassing it."
528839, "...And whose blood was it?"
528840, "Only he knows that. But that's not the mystery. On days six and seven, the Haruspex brought me blood that was similar to Simon's. Where was he getting it from?"
528841, "Capella has asked me to bring you your old book of fairytales."
528842, "Let me see. No, that's not our book of fairytales... This one has some that weren't included in the Tale of the Sons, and not even in the Ughun. My sister had them copied by hand... Apparently these things have never been written down before. Thank you. Just a little while ago a present like this would've made me very happy."
528843, "And now?"
528844, "And now it's reminding me that there's probably no use trying to get to the bottom of things that people aren't meant to know. I'm even wondering if I haven't incurred the earth's wrath by inflicting such a wound on it... I guess I'll surrender to the Worms at the Termitary. That's the thing to do."
528845, "What for?"
528846, "It will be a symbolic death. Tomorrow the Inquisitor will re-open the Termitary and find out who and when gave the order to board it up. No, I've made up my mind! I won't wait until I'm dragged out by the ear; I'm going to surrender voluntarily to those I subjected to such tortures and executions."
528847, "I'm not afraid of you either."
528848, "But that's not true!"
528849, "Whether it's true doesn't matter at this point. Have you heard the news? Mark Karminsky, a governmental Inquisitor, arrives here tomorrow."
528850, "No..."
528851, "I have."
528852, "No, it was you!"
528853, "That's exactly why I need him!"
528854, "He'll kill you..."
528855, "We'll see about that!"
528856, "He'll kill me if he finds me against my will."
528857, "He's gone to the runaway butchers' den, to-whatserface, that sort-of-human-ah yes, Aspity! Her belongings were found in the Cathedral."
528858, "And you, Lara? Have you been cleared?"
528859, "I don't know yet... But I did agree to be tested. I gave him my blood."
528860, "Where is the Bachelor?"
528861, "Don't make me angry... or I'll bite!"
528862, "I wasn't trying to in the first place. Where did he go? "
528863, "He's gone to the Shelter to see Lara Ravel. I wonder how exactly the semi-half-witted Lara wound up on the suspect list..."
528864, "It was!"
528865, "Don't you know? A woman sneaked mysteriously into the Cathedral at dawn, passing through walls and doors. She kissed the lips of everyone who was sheltered there, and gave them gifts. They all died. And the things they were clutching in their hands-those were Yulia's belongings."
528866, "Ah, so that's what happened! I've been suspecting her for a long time."
528867, "But it wasn't Yulia, was it?"
528868, "Oh, how I'd like to have a frank conversation with her..."
528869, "Then seize the moment. She'll spill the beans now."
528870, "I could swear on something holy..."
528871, "What measure is a while?"
528872, "Tell me about your brother."
528873, "So you're not close?"
528874, "All he ever thinks of is money. Well, money and Steppe lore. He's crazy about it... But even that doesn't make him a good conversationalist."
528875, "Steppe lore?"
528876, "Yes. The legends and myths. The rites and traditions. By the way, he asked for a book of fairytales; my kids have copied one for him. But you are a Steppe lore character yourself, it would seem?"
528877, "Not as fortunate as you think."
528878, "I don't know... What does it suggest?"
528879, "What? I've never even seen you before!"
528880, "The Saburovs have adopted me! They wouldn't have believed such an absurd lie!"
528881, "The Bachelor paid a visit to Alexander. He made an offer that Saburov simply could not refuse. Well, they still have some affection for you; so I don't think they are going to have you arrested. However, you will no longer find shelter with them. Where will you stay? You can rest your head in my place, if you agree to humour me with a heartfelt confession."
528882, "What? Who used my head as a guarantee?"
528883, "All the evil deeds that I have been accused of... were committed by my sister."
528886, "That was all her! "
528887, "The Bachelor is an astute, perspicacious man. It is only a matter of time before he figures out which line of enquiry is most feasible. Before then, you could tell me... where does your sister stand in relation to you? How did she come to be? I doubt your inelegant fabrications were enough to bring her to life."
528888, "No... What?"
528889, "People who'd been in the streets and faced the threat of infection were being sheltered at the Cathedral, per the Bachelor's orders. He had had something in between a shelter and an isolation ward set up there. Last night, a disease carrier infiltrated it and infected the entire crowd with Sand Plague."
528890, "That's horrible! Are they all dead?"
528891, "Yes. Almost four hundred people. And I have no doubt that the real culprit behind our present calamity is going to meet her end today."
528892, "Who could it be?"
528893, "I'm positive that a certain Yulia Lyuricheva is the perpetrator. Items belonging to her have been found at the Cathedral. Waste no time-or she will escape the reckoning. Expose that warlock! Or else somebody will warn her... or accuse someone else. Yes?"
528894, "Who are the Inquisitors? "
528895, "Ah... you don't know. They are horrible creatures. Government envoys who specialize in unresolvable situations. Intellectuals with a licence to put the most perverse plans and arrangements to a practical test-all for the sake of efficiency."
528896, "But you're going to stop them from wreaking havoc, aren't you?"
528897, "The worst thing is that they enjoy an unrestricted mandate. Stopping an Inquisitor is as impossible as stopping a ghost-or time. If they want something done, they will do it."
528898, "But how can I get closer to that Yulia? She's clever and, I think, has an iron peg for a heart... There's no hook with which to catch her."
528899, "I don't know who you are, what kind of a demon you are, but I have a feeling that you exist in two concurrent guises. I do not wish to take my chances anymore."
528900, "You're... not being serious, are you? It's some kind of a practical joke, isn't it?"
528901, "Out! Do not attempt to move me with your words! Perhaps you've kept me under your hypnosis all along? Go away! I shall not be held for a fool any longer."
528902, "So you've joined the host of my persecutors too now! And I believed in you so much!"
528903, "Bit of a late epiphany there, eh... daddy?"
528904, "All right. I'll leave... You don't need to yell."
528905, "I have a feeling that this is the last time we're talking like this... as a loving father and an obedient daughter."
528906, "You'll be inviting me back soon. "
528907, "What will you ask of me today?"
528908, "Today we'll attempt to convert Vlad the Younger; we'll search for allies among the Termites."
528909, "Whatever you say."
528910, "I've thought of approaching Victor-he's a more powerful figure-but the Utopians are much too fierce. Our escapade yesterday must have infuriated Maria."
528911, "He's a simple person. He doesn't need recommendations or introductions. That said, he is cynical. We need an incentive... He loves money most of all... but he has other weaknesses too. After all, he's not digging that well for the money! I doubt he's looking for treasure there..."
528912, "What am I to do?"
528913, "I can't tell a lie. Just like you! I'm your heiress."
528914, "Ask whoever you like."
528915, "Have you lost hope?"
528916, "Farewell... Katerina."
528917, "I'm not my own enemy..."
528918, "The Bachelor said that he and the Haruspex have been trying to solve the riddle posed by the mysterious blood that appears to be strangely identical to Simon's. The answer to the riddle is hiding inside the Termitary, risking his life every minute. If you go there, we will provide you with medicine, weapons, and protective clothing."
528919, "What do I have to do with this?"
528920, "That's what I want to find out."
528921, "All right. I'll go."
528924, "I'll make it so everyone will be saved."
528925, "So what is it? Or did you hope to intimidate me by saying the name of my daughter-in-law?"
528926, "Would your attitude change if I told you that my visit will determine the fate of the Polyhedron?"
528927, "Do you believe your visit is that significant? Now it's you who will answer my questions candidly and without prejudice. Are you one of Aglaya's confederates?"
528928, "Yes."
528929, "No. I am her victim."
528930, "How did you know?"
528931, "Aglaya would grasp at any formal pretexts that would allow her to file her report as soon as possible. You are yet to visit the Tower, but all the conclusions from your visit have already been drawn... Nevertheless, one should always hope for a miracle."
528932, "How can I help you?"
528933, "What kind of things are they? Do tell."
528934, "If you tell me something first. Why is that tower so precious to you?"
528935, "I'm afraid Nina will show you nothing, since you're no longer a child. All that you may possibly see there are cold walls and empty flights of stairs."
528936, "You promised."
528937, "Victor will open the path into the Polyhedron for you. Only he knows how to to earn the good favours of his beloved wife. He was the only one she'd ever listen to."
528938, "Oh my, that's a lot to reflect on..."
528939, ""
528940, "I hope this torture ends soon..."
528941, "Katerina would speak the same words every time the Rat Prophet possessed her..."
528942, "There's nothing but joy ahead. Isn't it so?"
528943, "Victor, I'm going to the Polyhedron. With Georgiy's permission..."
528944, "Yes, I know. But I am afraid you're not going to see anything there. I doubt that Nina will be favourably disposed towards you."
528945, "We'll see. How can I get past the barrier?"
528946, "It's simple. Go all the way to the top. You'll see my son there. If he's not there, wait for him or tell one of the Dogheads to call for him. When he receives you, you should immediately-without answering any questions, without a greeting or an apology-say the following words: 'Fains I!'"
528947, "Thank you. 'Fains I'..."
528948, "Why?"
528949, "Because she loves me, and is pained by the thought of me having to part with my life... without even a guarantee that the whole affair will be a success."
528950, "What are you talking about?"
528951, "You can't even begin to imagine the immense power of voluntary self-sacrifice. Don't you know there've been examples in history where someone living would give their life so that someone deceased could spend a little more time with their loved ones?"
528952, "No... My knowledge of history is... well... not great."
528953, "...Nina is not just my beloved wife. She is a spirit in whose name one could charge into battle with despair itself. Nina has imbued the town with spiritual force; Nina has breathed life into it-and Nina too will save it from the Fourth Army and its cannons!"
528954, "You want to sacrifice your life for Nina?"
528955, "But what about Simon? I thought he was the town's protector."
528956, "Any member of the Circle of the Bound will readily sacrifice themselves for the sake of the Town's salvation. Had Simon been a giant, with enough blood in him to fill an ocean, the Town would have been saved. But Simon's blood was only enough for a handful of people..."
528957, "Then my sympathies are with you completely!"
528958, "Pity about that. History provides a better understanding of the modern times."
528959, "That's deep! So how do I get into the Polyhedron?"
528960, "How do I get into the Polyhedron?"
528961, "Good. An honest and straightforward answer. Well then, prepare for quite an ordeal..."
528962, "Wait. First I'd like to know what this Tower is."
528963, "This Tower? It's a toy that makes any adventure pale in comparison. It's a treasure. It gives the gift of dreams. Here, the most fragile fantasy can be played with forever. Here you can share your dreams with others and play in them together."
528964, "But a dream can be retold if it's worth it..."
528965, "Yeah, or drawn or... I mean, that's just silly! Don't you know that the most precious aspects of dreams-the things that make you want to keep on dreaming forever and never wake up again-vanish moments after you wake up? A dream can't be recorded or retold. The magic is gone then."
528966, "And now let me in."
528967, "I do! I do wish to become one of you."
528968, "Are you saying this Tower can preserve dreams?"
528969, "Not just preserve them! Bring them back! Continue them! Share them with others. Not just the characters and the worlds, but the very fragrances of the ether. The most magical of dream experiences. The most precious of fantasized events."
528970, "What, these bare walls can do that?"
528971, "Are you seeing bare walls? I feel sorry for you."
528972, "And what do you see?"
528973, "I see ships aflame, traversing the islands of Orion."
528974, "We won't find a lot of mutual understanding."
528975, "Come in and look around. I'd have gladly showed you what I'd like to see-but you're a grown-up already."
528976, "It's all right."
528977, "Well done. You're brave."
528978, "Taya Tycheek? Not a lot of smart there to outsmart. She can lead herself up a garden path on her own just fine. How about... we remind Khan who's in charge instead?"
528979, "Mother says you once brought an exceptional storyteller to her."
528980, "Wait! Does she like fairy tales? Taya, I mean..."
528981, "She does. The catch is, she knows every single one. She was nursed by odonghs, and they're great storytellers. She's heard them all!"
528982, "We haven't had the real conversation yet... sister."
528983, "Did he take the inheritance from you by force?"
528984, "Nonsense! Why would he take by force what's rightfully his own?"
528985, "Who is he?"
528986, "He is a Warden. He is of menkhu stock; his father was a surgeon. I revere him. Soon he will overthrow the usurper, become leader of the Kin, and inaugurate a new era. Then I shall go back and vanish into the Earth."
528987, "Utopia?"
528988, "There are three nodes nourishing our town. The town had been growing until the nodes closed. The Earth begat beasts. The Beasts sustained Humans. The Humans begat a settlement. The settlement sustains the children. The head had been drawing juices in excess. The plague closed the nodes. Everything resumed its natural course."
528989, "What does that mean?"
528990, "The Settlement is a burden on the Earth. The Utopia is destroying the Settlement. The plague will destroy the Utopia. The Sand Pest is a creature of the plague-the will of the Law. I used to think it was my destiny. Now I see that it's yours."
528991, "No. Not mine!"
528992, "What's a 'Utopia'?"
528993, "The Utopia is a whim. A desire for the impossible. Children don't know the value of presents. They don't know that happiness is ephemeral. They want it to be full and never-ending. Before, life itself used to curb such things. The mirror trap had shut out the laws of life; it had left them outside. And so the Plague had to intervene."
528994, "But the suffering is dealt out to everyone! Why not just smite the Tower?"
528995, "The town and the Tower are no longer separable. The town sustains it-feeds it with its children. The town exists for the Tower's sake. Just listen to them, they're all obsessing over some new construction project. That's what they believe to be their mission, led on by their blind rulers. That's the dream that gives a meaning to their futile existence."
528996, "You are evil!"
528997, "If nothing else, it moves and it speaks."
528998, "What did she say?"
528999, "She esteems Burakh. She says yes, he is indeed who he claims to be."
529000, "I haven't had a chance to find out yet."
529001, "Because you've lied?"
529002, "...Not just that. I am no more of a Priest than Katerina is a Mistress... It all started because of us. The thirst for power brings down the worthless and elevates the great... I only hold this position as a result of my colluding with Olgimsky... Katerina owes hers to an absurd coincidence."
529003, "Why did you call me that?"
529004, "For a reason. Speak. I have no power over you. Neither do you have power over me."
529005, "Ah, you are so mistaken..."
529006, "Are you capable of killing? Oh... sorry, I can see it's a silly question."
529007, "I have slain ninescore and fourteen bulls, flesh of the flesh of the Vein of Boddho. I have slain seven dozen and eight Sons of Boddho that I deemed undesirable. What else do you want to know, Earth?"
529008, "...Do you kill everyone you come across?"
529009, "What the mission that he's unable to accomplish is."
529010, "How?"
529011, "Get to know what Sahba-ötün thinks of him. The one that the Worms call Aspity. The heart of the matter is simple. Find out if he had killed her to deceive his way into the true heir's inheritance. You will come back here through the Gates of Labour. You will not be impeded."
529012, "It's good. Your suffering will end soon."
529013, "I know all fairytales. I've heard them all many times over. Bo-ring. Since I've left the Tower, only Sticky has managed to amuse me that one time."
529014, "How? Did he make up a fairytale?"
529017, "Really? Yes, very very much!"
529018, "Listen carefully; my fairytale will contain the answer. Will you be able to guess it?"
529019, "I'll tell you one about the poor orphan and the pearl divers."
529020, "Once upon a time Taya woke up in the middle of the night and-"
529021, "That's a scary one! I don't want it."
529022, "As you wish..."
529023, "It contains the answer, Mother..."
529024, "I've heard that one a thousand times! Go away, your tales suck."
529025, "Bah! Here's another then."
529026, "Go away! Or I'll call the butchers! Hey, bu-"
529027, "Hush, hush, quiet! I'm leaving."
529028, "You made that up. I don't want to listen."
529029, "Why do you think so?"
529030, "Go away! Or I'll call the butchers! Hey there-"
529031, "Hush, hush, quiet! I'm leaving."
529032, "All right. Go ahead."
529033, "[...]"
529036, "I can work miracles. I can't have been conceived by spite."
529037, "What, no smoky or copper either?"
529038, "Whose turn is it today?"
529039, "Rubin's time has come. I have received reliable information that he was in the know on everything that Isidor, the father of that accursed Burakh, was doing. It was with him that everything began."
529040, "Oh... But..."
529041, "I know that the Kains have put a sizable bounty on oynon Rubin's head. It almost matches the bounty on your... alter ego. They must have a good reason for it. Georgiy is no fool. This closet is a veritable ossuary!"
529042, "Just don't send me to the Kains!"
529043, "Talking to the Kains is useless, whereas honest Rubin will tell you everything himself... if you find the right approach. Perhaps he is innocent. I'd like to think he is."
529044, "I'll find that approach."
529045, "I have no doubt that you will."
529046, "All the more reason to convince others of his innocence."
529047, "I'll think about it."
529048, "Is he guilty? "
529049, "No. And he doesn't know who is. "
529050, "I didn't ask... I thought you wanted to find out through him who brought the plague with Isidor..."
529051, "Who indeed?"
529052, "Tomorrow we shall examine Yulia. She is a recluse, and I've had my suspicions about her for a long time. Even if it isn't her, she should at least give some clue as to where to look for the witch. She is intelligent."
529053, "Yes. The scoundrel is almost as dangerous as his brother."
529054, "Please, let him be for a while. I need to ask him a few questions. "
529055, "So you want him to poke his head out of his hole? "
529056, "Yes. "
529057, "I could just about wash the dishes..."
529058, "It's because of people like him that our town has been stricken by the plague."
529059, "Even if it were really so, what of it? If an injured man burst into your house fleeing from assassins, would you throw him out and at their mercy just so that no harm should come to your home? Why, even if there were a hundred of them and we could only be saved by a miracle-damn it, I'd grab my dagger and hope for that miracle!"
529060, "Persuade your brother to confess! Concede that the Humble are right, and the pestilence will leave the town!"
529061, "What did you say, little pimp? That I should persuade my brother to side with the Humble? Go to hell! Feel free to humbly accept whatever you please-poverty, powerlessness, ignominy, stupidity, weakness, filth, war-but we will not!"
529062, "Since the town's rulers have declared their allegiance to the ideology of Humility."
529063, "You heard me! You know the reason!"
529064, "Shut up! What do you know about faith? What do you know about religion? You had barely been born and already you got your head full of the ravings of a failed prophetess-who's writhing her hands in desperation and envy as she's watching a new star rise-and here you are, thinking you can lecture me, even daring to accuse us of heresy and a revolt against God!"
529065, "What could you tell me about Simon that I wouldn't know? "
529066, "Simon is dead, but..."
529067, "I won't tell you, unless you promise to pardon him!"
529068, "I shall only make that promise on the condition that he stands a fair trial. And knowing Rubin, I am prepared to believe that he himself will prove to be the most harsh judge of all. That is why I only want him found... nothing more."
529069, "All right. I'll find him. What will you accept as proof of his innocence?"
529070, "What will I have to do today?"
529071, "...I don't know for sure yet. Desperation is a bad advisor! To make a move too early is always to lose-lose the little we have... But sometimes, even though you know it's the wrong move, you find it hard to hold back: what if you're lucky? That is how we are going to play now... threatening the queen..."
529072, "Why him?"
529073, "He is a murderer, a mutineer, an impudent rebel. His creations subvert the foundations of matter. He has challenged the law of earthly gravity. He has insulted the Earth by building an edifice that does not touch our ancient mother, the nourishing Vein of Boddho..."
529074, "Is he an architect?"
529075, "He is. Just like his depraved brother Andrey... All that they do, they do together. All that they feel, they feel together... Perhaps that is their weakness... Convert Peter! Then the fierce Andrey will be in our hands too, since they are twins, and one cannot live without the other."
529076, "There is nothing to doubt. Or have I failed to convince you of the righteousness of the truths we profess?"
529077, "I need to work up the courage..."
529078, "I don't know if that's true..."
529079, "Oh, the pain... So how did it go?"
529080, "He was on the verge, but then Andrey-"
529081, "Nngh... No... So what about him?"
529082, "Andrey ruined everything. He threw me out."
529084, "...What? What did you say? Why hooks? What's the matter with you?"
529085, "Mother... Why are you like that? What have I done wrong?"
529086, "Do you need morphine?"
529087, "Hmm... Yes... I've taken some already."
529088, "Would you like me to relieve the pain?"
529089, "I didn't mean to say that... About you... Forgive me... This will pass. It's nothing... Don't listen to me."
529090, "What kind of danger?"
529091, "I don't know..."
529092, "You take care of yourself too... dear."
529093, "Dangers?"
529094, "There are horrible people everywhere now. And their numbers are growing... They kill, they torture, they stab and slash. It seems like no place is safe from them anymore... I dread to think they might soon start digging up graves!"
529095, "Can I spit into it?"
529096, "It's beautiful... Does it have an echo?"
529097, "Impossible. I'm studying the soil. And now the Bachelor has demanded a re-run of the tests. He's almost established for a fact that the disease originated in the earth. Yes, it probably crawled out from underground. But not out of my well!"
529098, "Oh..."
529099, "What do you want with Rubin?"
529100, "He's in danger."
529101, "Is it true that the Saburovs have adopted you?"
529102, "...It is."
529103, "Is that a bad thing?"
529104, "Hm... I guess I'd better show my hand... Rubin won't be hiding for long, it's against his character... Listen, you might want to not hand him over to the Kains. He'll be of use to you yet."
529105, "But will he talk to me?"
529106, "Bring him lots of twyrine and different kinds of meat. A good treat will make him happy. It's pleasant to accept food and drink out of a girl's hands. He'll talk to you."
529107, "No, I can't."
529108, "...All right. I will."
529109, "Do you believe that it was your blasphemous deeds that caused this pestilence?"
529110, "...I do."
529111, "Are you prepared to change your convictions, repent, and admit to the fairness of the punishment?"
529112, "...No! I cannot."
529113, "But are you prepared to amend the consequences of your pride?"
529114, "About what?"
529115, "Don't you remember? About you agreeing to convert to the faith of Humility."
529116, "Confess."
529117, "Well... in that case I'd be better off dead. When I reach that conclusion firmly and I'm drunk... or if, God forbid, I sober up and get hit by a horribly clear realization-I'll do the deed on my own."
529118, "Yes. It's more than likely that my sister has been following me..."
529119, "Why are you hiding here?"
529120, "I'm an outlaw now, just like you. Do you know what the word 'outlaw' means?"
529121, "It means... Well, it means that the Powers That Be are out to get you, right?"
529122, "Nonsense. The Powers That Be have nothing to do with it. It's much deeper than that. And simpler."
529123, "How so? It's all right, keep eating..."
529124, "What secret?"
529125, "Simon's blood has given us the vaccine. And I mean it. Simon fought valiantly against the Sand Pest. He was the only one to defy it... but he didn't last long enough! I think there are other bodies like his. And yet his blood was special..."
529126, "A deep thought! Are you a philosopher?"
529127, "A little, as every doctor is... You see, I'm a menkhu as well, and every menkhu is an oynon. But it was the Bachelor who pointed me towards the idea. There are indeed special people in the world; people whose very nature challenges the laws. If you help me, I'm going to search for such people."
529128, "Could it have been... just a woman?"
529129, "It was the disease in human form. A spirit. If my Master said this is possible, then it must be so. And she did have the face of a woman. I know nothing else-except that my teacher didn't die of the disease; he was murdered."
529130, "How did you pick those people?"
529131, "For years, I have been keeping order in this town and looking out for possible criminals. I trust my clairvoyant wife's judgement. Even that trust, however, I would have thought unduly partial, but for seeing my hypothesis confirmed by her rival Mistresses."
529132, "So what do you expect from me?"
529133, "I only want one thing, and that is-justice! This is a case where we can dispense with evidence and trials. When the last dawn is rising above the world, it is time for arguments of a different nature. A trial resting on conscience, and a verdict resting on faith. Find the culprit for us! It is why you've come into this world, and into our house, the house of the town's rulers."
529134, "...Who should I begin with?"
529135, "A mysterious creature named Aspity will, I am sure, be the best start. Children say she is an evil spirit. Simon didn't like her. That bitch has been called a walking plague even before this. I'm sure that a woman, a maneater, and a spawn of the Steppe-which is exactly what a shabnak is-is a fitting description for her."
529136, "How do I make her reveal herself after I've gained her trust? Who can tell me something about her that she'd be surprised to hear?"
529137, "Right... You don't know anybody here... The shortest way is via the Olgimskys. Ask Vlad the Younger, Olgimsky's son. The Olgimskys must have old scores to settle with her. Besides, Vlad the Younger is knowledgeable about the legends and traditions of the Steppe people... He will instruct you."
529138, "Yes, exactly!"
529139, "Not good... So there's been no miracle."
529140, "No. She isn't."
529141, "Olgimsky was asking..."
529142, "Ha ha! The old shark... Right... so if Vlad finds out that this cutthroat has learned to mix herbs, the guy's in for it! Vlad the Wholesaler's already got what, eight thousand indentured servants-what's one more?"
529143, "Ouch..."
529144, "It's up to you if I should rat him out to Vlad. The Haruspex will be useful to you, so don't cross him... He'll figure out who the snitch was right away. I can sell you some immune system boosters, but they'll cost you."
529145, "You're so pretty too! Sweet as sugar, really."
529146, "And how do you know that? Now... look me in the eye, Anna! What was it you said yesterday about evildoers?"
529147, "Look here... Leave me alone, my dear, and I will show my gratitude. I have means too, didn't you know? I'll tell you another thing. That Ripper, the one from yesterday-the Olgimskys have given him shelter. So the thing is-they don't have to snatch medicine from the people. He knows how to make his own!"
529148, "Really?"
529149, "Common folk are gossiping about it already. His father knew the secret! And he, the Ripper, has been concealing his art from Vlad... because there's a mystery involved, and he needs blood! And he probably guessed that Olgimsky would make him work to return the favour. I wish he did just that! Just show this mixture to Vlad, and he'll have that man chained to the wall by his leg at once."
529150, "Don't be obstinate, my dear."
529151, "And you're really rich, it turns out! But that's fine, I don't discriminate."
529152, "You don't have to..."
529153, "I don't have to? But..."
529154, "Ah! I know, I know who you are... You're the Saburov foundling. Move along."
529155, "I just wanted to do good..."
529156, "What? A foundling?"
529157, "You may regret it..."
529158, "Who's Aspity?"
529159, "Ah, so you don't know... She's a woman living in the kip on the edge of Earth. Some people call the place a 'hospice'."
529160, "Ha ha... An excellent recommendation."
529161, "'Aspity' is Sahba-ötün, blockhead! The Queen of Worms!"
529162, "...Shall I teach you some manners perhaps?"
529163, "Ouch! Don't do that."
529164, "Nevertheless, I believed her at once."
529166, "I can't be bothered. Love will find a way. Blockhead."
529167, "Have you been visited by a large man with sinewy arms and of a violent inclination, whom they call the Haruspex?"
529168, "You'll find all of them herb dealers at the den. Now there's a ruthless man that runs the place, an artist and a builder, and from across the Steppe too, from where no one lives but dressed-up deaders and the spawn of Suok... Here, he brews his twyre brews, and he blasphemes, and he blasts curses over them!"
529169, "Blasphemes? How?"
529170, "He ill-treats them herbs, he tests how much they'll take... He buys them up more 'spensive than we can. And he stirred up some bad blood among our lot; made us kill them with our own hands, them as had been giving him the secret spices... If you find some herb, don't sell it to him. He'll hurt the herb."
529171, "Would you like me to sell it to you?"
529172, "There's more than one haruspex round these parts... ay, they are many, the knowing ones. Which one are you looking for? The biggest and meanest of them, that would be Foreman Oyun. He was here two days ago; stomped out our fires, so he did, and trampled on our yurts. If we hadn't taken cover, his hooves had sure been the end of us."
529173, "Did he bring you any herbal concoctions?"
529174, "He did. But I wouldn't take none. So he took them to them dealers, who buy and sell again."
529175, "Who are those dealers?"
529176, "So that's who Burakh took the herbs to? Then that's who I need."
529177, "Oh, we shan't have no commerce with you: you smell like clay! Don't come to us anymore, you reek of clay, so you do, and greasy and clotted clay too..."
529178, "Freak!"
529179, "Ugh... that's a disgusting thing to say."
529180, "Fond of whom?"
529181, "Well... the flowers are for them, aren't they?"
529182, "Of course they are."
529183, "And is there anything I could do for you? I'd be glad to, because just yesterday, as I was looking at you, I thought I'd like to give you... a hook."
529184, "Exactly, Grace. Think about what I said. And now wake up, it's done. It's all over."
529185, "Of course!"
529186, "That simple? And what do I give Grace herself?"
529187, "She doesn't need anything. With people like Grace and me, it's the good done to one's neighbour that matters. I thought you understood that."
529188, "I'm listening."
529189, "These are our parties. The first thing, the original creation, was the Earth. The ancient one, giving life to plants and animals. She begat the Abattoir; she begat the Kin. She gives and she takes. The dead go into her; everything ends with her. She is the inception and the completion. Such is the Law. We, the Saburovs, act in the interests of the Law, by which everyone must abide. Ours is a faith of Humility."
529190, "A wise faith."
529191, "A town sprang up upon the Earth. A town of men was built upon her, the Earth eternal, the giver of life: built by greed and creativity, by ingenuity and hard work. The Abattoir found its continuation in the Works and the railway. The hands of the Olgimskys crafted an environment in which people could develop and reflect. Theirs is a faith of Construction."
529192, "A necessary faith."
529193, "Finally, the minds of people desiring to overcome the limits set for human beings by their nature and condition, engendered projects that were fantastic and audacious. That was how the party of creativity and invention emerged and flourished: the party of the Kains. Theirs is a faith of Utopia. A belief in miracles. A belief in a non-existent place."
529194, "A weird faith..."
529195, "I foresee myself knowing why this punishment has befallen us. The town lived, grew, developed, and finally tried to break free of its own limitations. The Earth that had borne it hit it on its head, which it had stuck out too far-much like a strict mother would do to her unthinking child."
529196, "Yes, Katerina. I believe that our faith is the true one."
529197, "You will speak to those Bound to you about the truth of Humility. You are to convince one of them, two of them, three of them of the true faith's wisdom. Should some of them prove stubborn, you will use the powers that were granted to you by providence itself."
529198, "With Grace? Doesn't she sympathize with you... with us?"
529199, "I want to be certain of that. Make friends with her. Try to make her like you and grow an affection for you eventually. You don't need much for this. And if you need to find out more about her, Lara Ravel is the person who will tell you all about Grace. She is as much of an angel of kindness as the poor daughter of the caretaker... and her father has recently died too."
529200, "So this is the will of the Earth?"
529201, "I believe that the Earth wishes to return unto herself what has moved waywardly out of her reach. And before I explain to you the path that I am setting before you, I want to know for certain whether I have my dear child on my side."
529202, "I'll look around and use my judgement. For now, I must obey: there is no other way ahead for me."
529203, "She believes and thinks the same way as we do."
529204, "I made her change her mind, just like that! It seemed like the right thing to do."
529205, "That is good. You have not, I hope, confused or disappointed her?"
529206, "A strange decision... Why did you do it?"
529207, "Whoa, whoa! Stop it! I already have a family."
529208, "Alexander Saburov wants to find the criminal guilty of bringing about the calamities threatening you all. I'm acting on his behalf."
529209, "She's the reason for all of the Kin's riots and unrest! No one has ever harmed our family more. Sometimes I feel she's an evil spirit. She appeared suddenly... after one of the riots. At the time, my father had brutally crushed the revolting butchers; and it was then that he'd appointed Oyun as their Foreman."
529210, "Is that so!"
529211, "Yes... And ever since then, I've thought of her as a personification of the Kin's defiance. I've even begun to confuse cause and consequence. Did she appear to avenge our cruelty, or are her provocations forcing my father's hand? It's become a vicious circle!"
529212, "We're friends now, she and I."
529213, "Uh oh..."
529214, "You moron. It's not what you think. It's about his life and his duty. I'm worried. He's being hunted. If you find him, tell him I've got the key to his destiny! He ought to hurry; time is of the essence. If he's in doubt, whisper one word to him: 'Inheritance'."
529215, "Who are you?"
529216, "...I was born five years ago, during the First Outbreak. I'm a reminder."
529217, "Are you the plague personified?"
529218, "...I could be. But I haven't done anything recently... though I did organize that riot which got the infected Isidor in a bit of a pickle."
529219, "What do you mean?"
529220, "Use that talent of yours to ask him about the black twyrine... I'd love to see how shifty his eyes will get!"
529221, "Oh, Filin? Not a clean spot left on that one! Name a crime, any crime, and he'll be guilty of it. What did he get himself accused of this time?"
529222, "Of spreading the epidemic."
529223, "A recent series of violent robberies."
529224, "How did you guess?"
529225, "Yes, that's what I am indeed. And while we're at it, I ought to explain to you what Katerina's business is with the theatre... It's got nothing to do with these Masks of mine. But there is, you see, this creature living down there. An abomination of a spirit; a taunter and a tormentor. We call it the Rat Prophet."
529226, "What? Now you're not making any sense!"
529227, "And I don't envy you at all."
529228, "Yes, yes... The thing is, Katerina's barren. She can't predict the future. That creature can, though, and it visits her at night. Unlike a true Mistress, however, it can tell lies-and it's certainly good at telling the right lies."
529229, "I've come to ask what's going to happen to the theatre now..."
529230, "Where is he then? Where? Don't keep me waiting!"
529231, "He may have gone to seek justice from the rulers... Will he find it? Or he may have found shelter with some good friends... But are they really his friends? Time will tell, my child... time will tell. And you-go and live your life. While you still can."
529232, "There's no need to hurry... Whoever's waiting for you, can wait some more."
529233, "I..."
529234, "...You've come to charm us. You're charming. No, don't say anything, you're doing a great job. But you really should've picked someone weaker for a start... Then this wouldn't have felt so inane, and we could do away with you without a second thought. When it's like this, though, we just don't have the heart..."
529235, "What is it?"
529236, "There's a manhunt going on for young Burakh. It appears that your patron, Alexander, is behind it. But he's unfair towards Burakh."
529237, "Why?"
529238, "The Haruspex doesn't just chop up the dead for his own amusement. He's trying to create a panacea. Please, find out what's happening and stop Alexander's punishing hand. He's blinded."
529239, "I'm ready."
529240, "...Today we shall strike where they don't expect us to... You will talk to Mark Immortell... He is the director at the Theatre who stages prophetic mime performances with his Masks... Some time ago, he staged a performance about the death of King Kuron... He knew Simon would die..."
529241, "You're shaking. Why? There's even sweat on your brow..."
529242, "...This is almost too important for me... I've had a prophetic dream in which the Bachelor was going to turn the Theatre into a leper colony... Just let Mark Immortell know about this... let him find a way to stop it... I need the Theatre badly! We need it... I can feel it..."
529243, "So? ...Why are you looking at me like that? This was not the most important of what you were going to tell me, was it?"
529244, "Do you know of the Rat Prophet?"
529245, "No, nothing... mommy. I still haven't talked to him."
529246, "...I sense something. When you uttered those words, I suddenly felt something familiar... as if something ran its sharp little claws across my back..."
529247, "It's the creature that whispers false prophesies to you in your sleep!"
529248, "It's my duty."
529249, "Now I'm convinced that Grief is the culprit! This man, this kingpin of the Warehouses, smuggler and death peddler, has now let gangs of thugs loose on the streets. You can see what's going on. They cut people down; they murder women; they rob homes... They are too much for the patrolmen."
529250, "...But how could he have caused the epidemic?"
529251, "Bachelor Dankovsky found during his investigation that Grief had ordered thieves to dump infected corpses into the river. Anything up to... several dozen. The thieves refuse to reveal the location. In fact, they are altogether denying having done it. But the claim must certainly be examined."
529252, "...That's just horrible! And yet the infected corpses had to have come from somewhere!"
529253, "That's what I'd like to know. I'd like to know if it's true, and if yes, the exact location where they dumped those corpses... before we stamp out this whole nest of vipers. And we are going to have to stamp it out. He has done too much evil already, this Grief. Perhaps he is not directly responsible-but indirectly is enough for us."
529254, "Gladly!"
529255, "Will our manpower suffice? There are cutthroats everywhere..."
529256, "You won't have to fight bandits. Do you really think I'm asking you to do what I've just talked our bloodthirsty Bachelor out of? I have already assembled a round-up squad led by a brave patrolman named Wolf. They will find the killers' lair... once Grief's guilt is proven."
529257, "I had a hunch about what might be in the bag..."
529258, "...My most trusted patrolman! The sharpest, the most skilful and daring! I had him in mind as the replacement for Yaklakh, who had gone missing... Who am I to rely on now? Ah, the blackguard! He has as good as cut off my right hand! I've had enough! Where did you say they were hiding?"
529259, "In a large, semicircular warehouse on this side of the river. It's quite nearby."
529260, "They are all done for... I'll crush these ones today, and the rest of them tomorrow! Let Grief breathe for now; he must be in a panic himself. We shall see in two days... So you haven't asked about the river yet?"
529261, "Yes, and it's good that you've mentioned it."
529262, "Why?"
529263, "But how?"
529264, "Tell him that doctor Rubin is waiting for him back home, with urgent business to discuss. This Rubin, by the way, is himself highly suspicious... Are the rumours true that he refuses to hand over Simon's body to the Kains? Georgiy is furious. Something's wrong here..."
529265, "And-"
529266, "He's in one of the infected houses. Be quick. This will be more proof that you stand on the side of the Law."
529267, "Indeed..."
529268, "Lara Ravel took note of this house. That Harpist of hers went there..."
529269, "I have warned the Haruspex. Lara will rejoice at the news."
529270, "The deed is done. Yet again I surpassed my father's expectations and did what a group of armed patrolmen was unable to accomplish. I should inform him at once."
529271, "It is as you said. Yes, I am her moulded cast, her harbinger, bringing justice. The hour is nigh when you shall have to bow down to me."
529272, "Yes, I do get called a thief, but I have no idea why. I haven't stolen anything."
529273, "Sorry. I often do this. I'm curious! I like meddling in all sorts of things I'm not supposed to meddle in. I guess that's why they call me a thief. And why do they call you a thief?"
529274, "Is that what they're calling me? I don't remember ever stealing anything."
529275, "Perhaps you're going to steal something? Make sure you do it carefully."
529276, "That happens a lot. You steal something and can't remember it afterwards. Must've been something important-or else something you don't just put in your pocket. Someone's name, maybe?"
529277, "So I'm getting shamed for a crime I haven't committed yet? You're a funny fellow."
529278, "Mine isn't the sort of name you get punished for borrowing."
529279, "Death..."
529280, "Yes! And, as would befit an angel, you smell of herbs: the spicy twyre and the harsh swevery... What is your name?"
529281, "I'd never have thought death to have green eyes. But it all depends on the state you're in, I suppose... And do you have a name?"
529282, "Call me Clara."
529283, "Call me Clara."
529284, "I melted into the layers of sand, and then the Earth cast me out again, right outside your door."
529285, "...Why are you lying to me? No, your tricks aren't going to baffle me... I have after all read a lot about you-creatures fashioned out of clay and bones. I know what's said about you in the Tale of the Daughters, and in the Baur Meges too."
529286, "Whoa! Don't joke like that... I hereby solemnly declare that none of that refers to me."
529287, "Then you oughtn't to be baffled by my simple tricks."
529288, "And what did I tell you?"
529289, "And you said you'd never come back because you liked me. Does this mean you don't like me anymore?"
529290, "I do."
529291, "You imagined all that."
529292, "Clara? This house is called The Lump, and I am Vlad Olgimsky... What, does my name ring no bells at all?"
529293, "...None what-so-ever!"
529294, "Your manner's telling me that you're a person of influence... and your voice, that you're very unhappy."
529295, "Could be... And who are they?"
529296, "My brother and I."
529297, "No, I don't have any siblings."
529298, "So you've seen me before?"
529299, "Hardly... What's your name?"
529300, "Eva. Eva Yan... And you must be here to see the Bachelor?"
529301, "Goodness no! That's an encounter I hope I'll be spared."
529302, "I'm here to see you, Eva Yan. Hello."
529303, "I have a name. I'm Clara."
529304, "Now that's a question I didn't expect... Smart thief, you!"
529305, "I'll surprise you many times yet, thief!"
529306, "The Changeling, right? I've heard a lot about you. Let's talk. I hope the cigarette smoke is no major nuisance? For reasons quite obvious I'd rather not open the window."
529307, "Why 'The Changeling'?"
529308, "Nevermind. No particular reason... Do you have any business with me?"
529309, "Nevermind. No particular reason... "
529310, "I've come to get acquainted with you."
529311, "I am no one. An instrument in the hands of a force whose name is not to be taken in vain. And who are you?"
529312, "...It's odd that you don't know who I am. I'm Capella. And even though I've never seen you before, I feel a gnawing uneasiness for some reason..."
529313, "There's definitely a reason."
529314, "I'm Clara. You haven't heard of me yet."
529315, "You're against the rules. I don't want you visiting the Theatre."
529316, "No one can prohibit me from entering."
529317, "I may be useful to you yet..."
529318, "You bring us nothing but misfortune!"
529319, "You have to be patient, Mother... Such is fate."
529320, "I thought the opposite..."
529321, "Whatever happens, I'm only fulfilling my purpose."
529322, "You shall visit a singer named Anna Angel. Of all the black souls in our town, this is the blackest. The Willows used to be the happiest house in this side of the town, and we were happy to have such neighbours. Now every crack in the walls of that house is oozing blood and tears."
529323, "My God... what happened there?"
529324, "No one knows. Ever since Anna came to our town, she has always gotten away with whatever she did. Neither does anyone know what happened to all the former dwellers of that house. They had been a family, and a tight-knit one..."
529325, "Do you suspect her?"
529326, "I suspect that one of the bloodthirstiest ghouls that walk the earth has infiltrated our town in the shape of this singer! Have you heard about the Caravan? Of course you haven't... Ask her about it and see what she has to say."
529327, "I have no will but yours, father..."
529328, "Are you sure? Clara?"
529329, "...I am sure."
529330, "Who is guilty then?"
529331, "I don't know! Are there no more bad people left in town? Don't you want to know who caused the disease?"
529332, "You're being hunted, Ripper! Beware. They're closing in."
529333, "Ripper? Me? How did I get a shameful nickname like that?"
529334, "Indeed? The Bachelor is very close. He won't hesitate to shoot, and you are unarmed."
529335, "You know what? Don't tip them off. I'm not planning anything evil... Wait, forget it, you're not going to believe me anyway. So look here: if you don't turn me over, I'll give you my concoctions. They're good; you'll see for yourself. Or are you really unaffected by the disease?"
529336, "Shout all you like... You've deserved this."
529337, "It's just twyre, Anna... sleep."
529338, "And so...?"
529339, "And so now, of course, he wants to kill her because of the Caravan. His Dogheads must have been prowling about the town looking for people with Caravan connections. Now they know, but the epidemic has struck in the meantime... As soon as he pulls himself together after his grandfather's death and is done setting up the Polyhedron's defences, he will surely dispatch a revenge squad to Anna."
529340, "That was unexpected..."
529341, "I will prefer to ignore what you have told me. Beware! I have my own relationship with the Bachelor."
529674, ""
529675, "I haven't seen you here before..."
529676, "I've never been here before."
529685, "I need infusions, Andrey. Let's trade..."
529706, "'The Curative Substances'"
529707, "It has transpired that Anna was sitting on a large stockpile of medicine. That is peculiary prudent of her... This isn't going to be an easy task, but I will have to convince her to give up her stash for the common good."
529708, "Anna told me a herb gatherer would know who the buyer of Haruspex's curative infusions was."
529709, "I can take the medicine supply to Vlad the Younger. Everything will be fair and equal now."
529710, "The medicine produced by the Haruspex was bought by Andrey Stamatin-a famous artist known to frequent the twyrine shebeen."
529711, "Too much controversy. Why do they care? Mass-produced chemicals and natural herb infusions can't perform miracles. The most that can be hoped for is to delay the inevitable. They must be blind, for they seek salvation in all the wrong places. Whom should I offer to sate the appetites of Vlad the Younger? It really doesn't matter."
529712, "*** I gave Anna's medicine supply to Vlad the Younger."
529713, "*** I didn't manage to keep Anna's supply."

Still, it will determine the wording of your verdict."

529730, "Are you interested? Do listen, it's really about you. So the Earth begat the town. Two entirely different worlds that have nonetheless managed to achieve a symbiotic coexistence. That was a miracle. A true miracle. Normally, civilization devours tradition."
529731, "I'm confused..."
529732, "As you can see, the town is small. It's made up of people, not ranks and functions. Fortuitous circumstances had enabled people to create an environment here that everyone could be happy in. But that was entirely due to a miraculous coincidence."
529733, "What coincidence?"
529734, "It's rare that a succession of extraordinary personalities should stand at the helm for five generations. It's even rarer that they should have the love and respect for one another that allows them to carry on the policies of their predecessors. Here, they had grown used to the miracle. And that was their undoing. They wanted to learn to control the miracles. The elder generation had constructed an environment for bringing up the young in the same spirit. They paid for it."
529735, "Why?"
529736, "The Law stipulates a harsh punishment for an attempt to capture a miracle. The disease is a means of restoring the balance. A part of the chimeric town must be destroyed, and there is no turning back. The town and the miracle cannot coexist. And I swear I know what the choice should be between them!"
529737, "Is this more of your claiming that I'm the disease?"
529738, "But what about me? What's going to happen to me?"
529739, "You are an instrument of the Law. But your mission has been accomplished. And it being my mission not merely to understand you but also to rein you in-I hereby prohibit you from existing, and banish you from the town. The captured Miracle shall pass into oblivion."

529741, "You may vanish into the earth that you came from. Go. I permit you-both of you, to be exact-to die in any way you prefer. On one condition. You are forbidden from even approaching the Commander. Otherwise he may fancy himself your tool. Or the other way round... I don't even know which is worse. Go."

529743, "Inquisitor Aglaya Lilich has prohibited me from seeing you. Why?"
529744, "Are you really this superstitious? Surely you were just making fun of me?"
529745, "The Inquisitor fears and detests me. I must say it's mutual. Most of all, I'm worried that the mission to save the town-or to destroy it, however you prefer to think of it-may degenerate into a long-range artillery duel. She's surely going to plot and scheme."
529746, "But why is she overestimating my role in this so much?"
529747, "She isn't overestimating. I had been greatly impressed with you-long before I saw you."
529748, "How is that possible?"
529749, "But she must follow your orders, mustn't she?"
529750, "On the contrary. My duty calls on me to obey the Inquisitor. But Lilich is always playing her own game. I've heard that she was once condemned to death for it-I suppose they pardoned her in the end... She will make a dishonest decision. One dictated, not by her duty, but by covert calculation. Both of the healers have clearly already been poisoned by her deception."
529751, "On our way here, a lieutenant told me a legend about the holy sisters-in-arms of the warriors. He spoke of medieval wars, of pilgrimages, of the power of the Holy Spirit that led quiet and unassuming young girls-orphans, beggars and peasants-to call the might of great armies to a lofty duty. I was profoundly moved by his story."
529752, "It was a mere coincidence."
529753, "Coincidences like this don't happen by chance. No... I gave it a lot of thought as we were travelling here. His story had come at the right moment. My life was approaching a watershed."
529754, "Speak on..."
529755, "Yes! My deployment to this plague-stricken little town was an expedition into hell. I was meant to die here-and so it will happen. The old Alexander Block will die-but a new one will emerge from this place. From this town, an army will set out on a glorious march-in the name of Truth."
529756, "Why do you say they've sent you here to your death?"
529757, "I've long become inconvenient to the Supreme Command. Since I've started my reform of the armed forces. Since I've turned the tide of the war. Since I've made clear that I'm striving to make perpetual warfare-the livelihood of corrupt generals-a thing of the past. They've tried and failed to get me killed by enemy fire-so now they're taking their chances with an unknown strain of plague."
529758, "Don't be afraid. No one will dare harm you."
529759, "I am invulnerable."
529760, "So the Powers That Be are hoping the plague will kill you?"
529761, "They are, and they're also hoping that this mission will disgrace me. I, Alexander Block, a hero of both campaigns, victorious and venerated by the people, now appear as a headsman and a scourge. When they gave me the assignment, they went out of their way to make clear how much the people are going to despise and detest the destroyer of this tiny town."
529762, "Who?"
529763, "I feel that what they want the most is for this town to continue to exist. Diseased and miserable, in flames and pain, a smithy of shared suffering-but still there. They've sent the army in out of fear of popular opinion. The people wield power too."
529764, "Then the people won't hate you..."
529765, "They will. The Powers That Be will take care of that. They know how to manipulate the masses. They will frame the town's destruction, not as a necessary sacrifice for the sake of public safety, but as a horrific mistake resulting from confusion. They will take all the credit for any good that will come out of this, and let me take all the backlash."
529766, "I won't let them do that!"
529767, "So the Powers That Be have destined you for the disease..."

529796, "A miracle..."
529797, "But you're probably the only one who can do something like that. You can work miracles, right? I keep arguing with this dumbhead here-she says we're playing with you wrong, says you're supposed to kill and not go around saving folks... Naughty you."
529798, "What?"
529799, "Well... we really didn't put you in that sandbox so that you'd save everyone. But you've been going at it with such vim and vigour, you must really be alive! I guess you really could save everybody. Just imagine how great that would be!"

Aglaya's hands are tied. While she is still alive, she won't let the Commander raze and demolish at will.

You see, if the town is destroyed, the head of Aglaya Lilich will be separated from her shoulders in less than a day./n/nIt has transpired that this whole situation affords her a stay of her death warrant. If she presents the town entirely purged of any disease to the Powers That Be-she is granted pardon. The issue is, it is impossible. The disease has soaked the town, it keeps rising up from the very roots of it./n/nIt is doubly deplorable that when she deceived you, she didn't merely save her life. She pursued her own purpose, too, which is to destroy the Polyhedron./n/nThe disease can be destroyed only if we destroy the town. There is no other option.

530603, "That won't be hard."
530604, "And now for the main course. This Bachelor... he's in charge of everything around here at the moment, the circumstances demand so. I don't trust him. He's digging some dirt on us, I'm afraid... He's smart though, very smart, the big-city rotter... you'd better get on his good side. He will keep digging and he will be successful... and may give you some clues. And I'll make sure he doesn't hurt anything... or anyone. Come by to see him, don't put it off."
530605, "There is a lot of confusing data... more of a chemical, than of a surgical nature. It seems worthwhile to consult with the Bachelor. Let's hear what his take on the matter would be."
530606, "The Bachelor was interested to learn more about our family brews. I mustn't disappoint. Not that I remember the exact formulas, but that's what muscle memory is for. First and foremost, I will need the distilling equipment and some twyre."
530608, "Trial and error? That's no way to make a panacea..."
530609, "What do you suggest then? I'm not a bachelor of savage arts... I'm only taking this seriously due to being scientifically open-minded. A) Make a couple of effective infusions. B) Treat several different organ specimens with them. C) Study the effects."
530610, "You think any infusion will do? They are all different. Very different."
530611, "How should I know! Aren't you supposed to be the expert on this? Not all of them are equally effective, I suppose. Stick to the best and go from there..."
530612, "I just don't understand how a protective solution can help produce an antibiotic."
530613, "So those antibiotics are like... panacea prototypes? All right. I'll bring you good samples when I obtain some."
530614, "I don't think these are regular protective solutions. I haven't studied your infusions in detail yet; that's most likely impossible under current circumstances anyway. I'm drawing my theories from what I know about your father's actions. He was succesful in using these... potions... variously. I do believe he somehow managed to make a serum. So follow in his steps. That's what I would do."
530615, "And that's what I'm going to do. Best of luck to you, oynon. Thank you for the advice."
530616, "...And?"
530617, "I've treated some organs with the new infusions like we discussed. Take a look."
530618, "Well, nothing surprising here. It's a sort of antibiotic. You can try taking it if you get infected... That can theoretically be helpful. It won't exterminate the disease within you, but will impede its development... temporarily. Or were you wondering if this is the panacea?"
530619, "I can already see it is not."
530620, "I suspect the panacea requires something special. A unique sample that contains both the disease itself and actively reproducing antibodies... I very much doubt ordinary tissues are capable of sustaining something of the kind."
530621, "Where could I get a sample of this special tissue?"
530622, "I'm on it. I promise I'll let you know as soon as I have any news. These infusions can also prove to be quite helpful though. If nothing else, they could at least help us live to see another day if we get infected... I feel like they will become useful sooner rather than later."

530643, "Would you give the sample back to me then?"
530644, "What for? If it contains no antibodies, then it's of no use to you. I could use it though. I, on the other hand, can work with it since the bacterial culture is there... however feeble."

Following the outbreak of a lethal disease commonly known as 'Sand Plague', 'Sand Pest', and 'Sand Dirt', the town authorities hereby declare state of emergency./n/nThe disease is extremely contagious. There is still ongoing research as to how the disease is transmitted, but cases of contact and droplet infection have been confirmed. There are currently no vaccine solutions in the town and none are to be expected before the regular train arrives. Please be extra careful!/n/nThe townspeople are forbidden to leave their homes unless under special instruction. Remember: the possibility of infection is much lower for those who stay indoors. The citizens are advised to sterilise their household wares, boil their clothing, and exterminate as many vermin as possible./n/nDo not panic! Medics, couriers and executors will take care of mail delivery, as well as the distribution of drinking water, provisions and medicine. Requests should be written down and slid under the door for couriers to collect./n/nThis address was composed on the instructions of Bachelor Dankovsky and ratified by the State of Emergency Town Governor Alexander Saburov.

There is no vaccine, neither here nor in the Capital. However, there are a few positive facts:/n/n1. The probability of contracting the disease is significantly lower for someone who has taken immune system stimulants. As of now we believe that A-pills and B-pills (yellow coloured and blue coloured pills, respectively) provide the best protective effect. Excessive doses of these medicants may be detrimental to one's health./n/n2. Additional protection is afforded by synthetic clothing. Woolen garments are strictly off limits (parasites). The clothing should be changed as often as possible./n/n3. IMPORTANT! The disease develops sporadically. At its initial stage, it does not progress in any significant way, especially if antibiotics are taken. However, if contact with the infection reoccurs, the development of the disease becomes extremely rapid./n/n4. The disease is not transmitted by means of droplet infection. As of now, we've yet to find out how it is contracted. Preliminary tests suggest that the disease is not contagious at early stages, therefore there is no need to isolate the sick person immediately after the appearance of the symptoms./n/nApp. The Executors:/n/nIn consideration of your particular line of work, we believe that you will not be able to avoid infection. If you have contracted the disease, do not give in to despair. It would have happened sooner or later anyway. Try your best to conserve the infection at its initial stage. Take antibiotic medicine.

530684, "The proud Bachelor, who had just been speaking to me, is absolutely convinced that he's free... But my worst misgivings have come true. He was nothing but a puppet in the hands of the Powers That Be. The target he's chosen at someone else's advice was worthy, but his righteous arrow returned to strike him in the back!"

I'll need someone to do the job... someone I can trust. I would test it myself, but they're unlikely to believe me. Are you ready to test your creation?"
530715, "I am."
530716, "Then you'll have to get infected and wait for the... critical stage. The experiment will have to be observed, of course. Take the panacea only after you begin to fade. Then the Executors will acknowledge that it works."
530717, "How shall we arrange this?"
530718, "I've notified the Executors that are on duty at the hospital. I think the place used to serve a different purpose before? Oh yes, the Theatre. They've been informed. They will bear witness to you getting infected and recovering. Executors are the ones wearing bird masks."

530735, "Wait. If it weren't for you, I would never have fulfilled my duty as a son. You can't possibly imagine how much it means... to me."
530736, "Definitely. Everything has a hidden meaning. Lies do not exist; and nether is it possible to invent a fantasy. Myths are always true-all you need is to find the right interpretation. As for your panacea... it will yet be of use... to all of us."
530737, "I can. But don't be rash. Perhaps the panacea has nothing to do with your udurgh..."
530738, "Do you believe in the udurgh?"
530739, "I believe in you."
530740, "This is not an answer. Do you believe the Sought One to be an udurgh? Do you take Steppe superstitions seriously?"
530741, "So Victor was right! It wasn't you who made the panacea, and now the Powers That Be will use this as an excuse to execute you, won't they?"
530742, "Ah, forget it... Where there's a will, there's a way... And Victor-are you talking about Victor Kain? Nina's husband? He has a keen mind. But he still loves his wife way too much... she never deserved a husband like that, and I mean it. Nor do I deserve your gratitude. What's done is done."
530743, "No one will ever dare to say that the panacea was made without your help."
530744, "It's a coincidence. Moreover, Dankovsky has told me all about your work-all I had to do was add the information I have to the mix. You alone deserve all the credit. Don't you ever deny your creation. You get the laurels, you get the responsibility. Your path hasn't come to an end yet. And, perhaps... neither has mine."
530745, "I'll tell them it was you who made it. You led me to the man-bull hybrid."

530747, "Thank you."
530748, "I know what this meant for you. And I won't forget it."
530749, "Laughably little. The Foreman only gave me enough to hold in my cupped hands."
530750, "I've been told a lot about the Abattoir... you know, the more I study this town, the more it feels like the Steppe beliefs are important. Every source needs to be spoken to in its own tongue... every source needs to be asked the questions it can answer..."
530751, "I agree."
530752, "Inquisitorial methods?"
530753, "Listen, Artemy Burakh. Come back here in a while. Tomorrow, perhaps. I might have something interesting to tell you then... If we manage without their help... yes, it'll be a true miracle. Then I'll be able to return with my head held high! But now I need to think."
530754, "Tell me, would you like to preserve this town?"
530755, "I would. I grew up here. My father is buried here. My name is respected here."
530756, "Not anymore. It disgusts me now."
530757, "Then our ways part here. However, if deep down you turn out to be a kinder person, I would be happy to accept your help."
530758, "I'll keep that in mind."
530759, "Does it look like I'm happy?"
530760, "I don't know. I think I forgot to drink it..."
530761, "You've chosen a bad time for jokes... I think it's time for you to return to the Executors. Better yet, drink it right here. I will find someone else to test it on."
530762, "No, it doesn't..."
530763, "You never know with you Inquisitors... You're good at hiding your true feelings."
530764, "No need. I'm going back to the Theatre."
530765, "I don't care."
530766, "I will not doubt your words."
530767, "Of all the goals I may have, saving this town is the most crucial one. I'll be honest with you-I do not love it; and I do suspect this hopeless mission is my last chance. Yet my choices have nothing to do with self-preservation; they're about integrity and ambition."
530768, "I understand."
530769, "The source of the disease will be found, and it will be destroyed. It's a matter of time-and it will only take a few days. The sick can be cured with your panacea. The plan is all-around great, but there's a huge hole in it. The panacea is scarce. Its main ingredient is a relic, a fossil almost; there are fewer aurochses left in this world than leviathans, as far as I can tell..."
530770, "That is so."
530771, "They say an aurochs was brought from the Steppe the day before yesterday to be sacrificed. It's supposed to deliver us from the plague. Odonghs say it was the last one."
530772, "That is so."
530773, "Still, I'm confused. I've been told that only a true Warden can handle an aurochs. Is this the reason why Olgimsky manages the Kin personally, but requires a middleman in any matter that has to do with the Abattoir?"
530774, "An interesting conclusion... I never thought of it like this..."
530775, "I understand."
530776, "The Foreman oversees the rituals and performs the Rite from time to time, cutting a bull in a way that has been the true way since the creation of the world-for the perpetuation of the world. That cosmic bull is an aurochs. It contains every element, every line, every tongue, every connection; everything. Have I been informed correctly?"
530777, "Yes, sounds about right."
530778, "But the rite didn't work out. The Kin is disappointed and unhappy with the Foreman. This means he did something wrong. The Kin had been locked up in the Termitary, so I assume there were few witnesses. Could it be that the Foreman was unable to handle the aurochs? Perhaps there was no mactation at all?"
530779, "Where did the blood come from then?"
530780, "That's exactly what's bugging me. The Rite was performed the day before yesterday, so many hours must have passed since then, but you were given steaming blood. It was full of oxygen, it was alive-as if it had just been extracted from a living body."
530781, "Speak."
530782, "Yes, my father used to say the same thing."
530783, "That is true."
530784, "Ask the Foreman where the blood came from. I think the Abattoir hides many secrets... and you are the only person that can get into its depths. The further we go, the more convinced I become that we're on the right path. Even in our enlightened times, we are to be saved by the legends of ancient herdsmen."
530787, "Why is it hopeless?"
530788, "Not for me; but I think they deem it hopeless. This town is little more than a grave they can throw anything into and watch it rot. I do have a suspicion that it's precious to them though... Yet they wouldn't have sent an artillery squad here... unless they had other towns to have fun with."
530789, "What are you planning to do?"
530790, "I don't even know if they'll let me in."
530791, "Oh, they will-after what happened yesterday. The Foreman is interested in you now. He is also frightened of you."
530792, "How do you know?"
530793, "He sent a messenger to seek Olgimsky's advice. They held a meeting. I've interrogated Vlad, and he said that the Foreman is very frightened. Basically, you've made a big commotion. See? I'm being completely honest with you."
530794, "If he is frightened, what's to stop him from closing the Abattoir and waiting for me to meet my death here?"
530795, "Try to get in there through the Termitary then. Taya Tycheek can open the way to the Abattoir. That girl is something else. Keep a close eye on her."
530796, "I will follow your bold advice."
530797, "Good luck to you, Artemy Burakh. Beware of the Foreman. He's afraid of you, but he is the kind of man whose fear is more dangerous than his calm."
530798, "What if the Abattoir is closed?"
530799, "Then get in there through the Termitary. I talked to this girl, Taya Tycheek, yesterday. Her power is incredible. She even made me doubt if I can make her obey my will. She knows how to open the Abattoir."
530800, "Tsk, tsk.. I don't think anyone has ever dared call me 'woman'."

530821, "So what about Clara?"
530822, "She is swooping at my children. She is definitely up to no good."
530823, "Why?"
530824, "There is a whole system of underground tunnels beneath the town, up to the Gorkhon river. Sacrificial blood has been poured down there for hundreds of years."
530825, "No surprise there. I've read about it when I was preparing for the trip. Furthermore, I know for sure that other peoples have similar cults. They all belong to different ethnic groups-some of them are northerners."
530826, "The blood there is alive. That means the town nourishes it-and it probably nourishes the town. That's inexplicable-but it's a fact. Well? Is it consistent with your data and calculations?"
530827, "I am simply interpreting Isidor's words. Here, I've written it down: he knew that said udurgh was in danger. He knew that only a miracle could save its life. He knew that in order to cure it, one would require rivers of panacea. And so he decided to replace the Foreman and regain legitimate control over the Kin to get closer to the... udurgh's bowels."
530828, "You are correct... Yes. It's true."
530829, "Well, I have a different point of view, but I think I'm reconstructing Isidor's thought process more or less correctly. The sign refers to some unnamed entity. It was silly of him to include this... superbeing in his list among ordinary patients. It must have been boggling his mind, too."
530830, "...Well I'll be... It is consistent with the calculations. As for the data... well, it also is. This is why digging wells is prohibited around here. This is why the rivers are so shallow and the Gorkhon is so clean. Yes. I'm impressed, but not shocked. I was prepared to encounter something unique... even though I expected the mundane."
530831, "How do you explain this?"
530832, "Wait a moment... this may be a rather fascinating natural phenomenon, but you should look at it from a different angle. If there is blood circulating in the town, feeding it, then it's alive. This is your Sought One. It all clicks, doesn't it? At least the size is fitting. What does 'udurgh' mean?"
530833, "'A body that contains the world.'"
530834, "What were you expecting?"
530838, "Something way less exciting. I thought the Foreman was hiding an aurochs somewhere-a wounded one, perhaps... They could have drawn some of its blood for you. One aurochs would allow us to produce a few thousands of portions at least-enough for the remaining people. I've heard they are gigantic. Almost comparable to brontosauri."
530839, "To what?"
530840, "That's just nonsense!"
530841, "Artemy, I want us to sort this out once and for all-and never bring up the subject again. I'm not an Inquisitor for you. It seems that fate wants it this way. You are not allowed to request such things of me. It would be... an abuse of my trust. An offence against my integrity and my duty."
530842, "But still..."

530968, "What? What did you see?"
530969, "Why the hell did you get in here in the first place?"
530970, "Well, nothing to write home about, really... I spent most of the time hiding inside that wardrobe... Old Isidor walked around a bit at first, then he had a bunch of visitors. I've seen little, heard even less."
530971, "Tell me about that little."
530972, "Well, he just sat there brooding for a while. Rattled and fiddled with some stuff, poured some water or something. Then someone really heavy came in. Isidor opened the door without asking, even though he used to always ask... The guy seemed like a Steppe man to me, had a harsh, low voice. A butcher, I'd say. Then it all went quiet."
530973, "Well, you know... We were sort of mates with the old guy... er, I mean your father... sir...  He spent a lot of time with us kids, was going to teach us things after we grow up. He made a lot of cool stuff, but showed us very little. We were sort of curious-you gotta be curious when you make friends with a Warden."
530974, "So you broke into his house to spy on him?"
530975, "I did nothing... I just thought maybe he'd brought some creepy stuff from the Steppe. A lot of things were brewing lately, I just figured he wouldn't go out there for nothing, would he? He used to bring all sorts of stuff from there... the clay head was one helluva thing!"
530976, "And?"
530977, "So. What do you know about how he was murdered?"
530978, "What do you mean?"
530979, "It was dark there, you know. The light died out-it was the guards who turned it on again later. But before that there was someone else here. Looked very much like a woman, or rather I got a feeling that it was a woman, but the silhouette was so... shapeless... more like a spirit, not a human."
530980, "I was just sitting there for two hours or so... but I wasn't sleeping! I thought that he did fall asleep though. Then I started to get out-and there he was, lying on the floor, all dead! I wasn't scared, but then I saw something that made me crawl straight back in again... Didn't quite get what I saw though."
530981, "Speak up!"
530982, "What are you taking about? What spirit?"
530983, "I'm telling you! That thing had a woman's head, but the body was crude, a lump of a body... and she made no sound... as if she were gliding, not walking. Then those guys came in, started stomping around, looking around. They said a Steppe creature was once again in the town, searching for food! A shabnak-adyr!"
530984, "Who is that? I think I've heard the word somewhere..."
530985, "Well... it's an evil spirit from the Steppe tales. Or at least that's what people say. Shabnak can refer to anything evil or inexplicable though."
530986, "Okay, I get it..."
530987, "Hah, who'd expect otherwise..."
530988, "All right. Now get outta here."
530989, "What visitors?"
530990, "I think the Foreman was one of them. There were also all sorts of Steppe guys here-butchers, Worms, and so on..."
530991, "...What of my father? You make so little sense, damn you!"
530992, "Ragi Barrow. This is where the Worms return a bull to the Earth."

530998, "Happy to help."
530999, "Yes. Very much so."
531000, "But why?"
531001, "I thought so."
531002, "Because now I know who wanted them extinguished... They have revealed themselves, and now I can seize them red-handed. Perhaps even pry them out of their shells... Ah, it doesn't matter. Don't think about it. I won't go into further detail."
531003, "Whatever you say."
531004, "I know who you're talking about anyway."
531005, "Why would fires be a nuisance to anyone...?"
531006, "Pfff, big deal. Who would come here from the Steppe anyway?"
531007, "Why put them out then? Someone must have had something to gain from this..."
531008, "What are they for?"
531009, "No, I don't."
531010, "The Termitary girl told me they were used to scare away wild animals... and evil spirits. The herdsmen believe the Steppe spawns ugly beasts from time to time to remind them of the hands that their fates are in."
531011, "We could light them up again if that would make you feel better..."
531012, "Oh, please be so kind! Capella says some enthusiasts are on it already. She is angry with me-which is really telling."
531013, "Why not just light them up again?"
531014, "It's all nonsense. Take it easy."
531015, "Why were you looking for Vlad?"
531016, "All right, don't worry."
531017, "Wouldn't you like to find out what the deal with the Termitary was? And by the way... who's an Inquisitor here-you or I? I think I'm starting to get confused."
531018, "Really? I'll talk to Capella then."
531019, "I'd rather you weren't an Inquisitor."
531020, "You all look the same... Where is Sticky?"
531021, "Sniffing around somewhere. Scouting or something. Or maybe lighting the fire in the Stone Yard? Ay, don't matter, he'll be okay..."
531023, "All right, let me help you. Got matches?"
531024, "No, I haven't. I'd like to know what you're doing here though."
531025, "Sticky, that rascal! So you're waiting for him here?"
531026, "Yeah. I mean, we could go to the Cemetery... That's where he's always meeting with them Soul-and-a-Halves. Someone's gotta be there... Or should we just wait a bit more? They actually could give us a thrashing..."
531027, "You filthy little..."
531028, "An ambush? Are you referring to yourself?"
531029, "Oh... I get it, I'm leaving."
531030, "Nope. There are Khan's Dogheads up ahead. Forget their age-they're merciless. They'll shoot you where you stand..."
531031, "Where's Sticky?"
531032, "He must've found out about the ambush. Sneaked up on them or something... I don't know where he is. Hiding at someone's place, perhaps. Who would let him in though? Everyone's scared..."

531035, "Right... play soldiers..."
531036, "Why did you come anyway? What do you want?"
531037, "Where's Sticky?"
531038, "I'll tell you what, we're leaving, my brother and I! Our belongings can go to blazes! How about I give something away to you too, the moment seems appropriate... See how the prices have shot up? A great time for profiteering. Having seed money can make you a millionaire by the evening."
531040, "You see, I don't trust you, Andrei."
531041, "Ok, I'll get you herbs."
531042, "Brown twyre. Ten blades. That will be enough."
531043, "Sure, whatever you say."
531045, "So you want the brown herb? Ok, you'll have it by evening."

531048, "Ten twyre blades. Good ones, too. Just look at the vein patterns."
531049, "That's definitely good stuff, Burakh! If Isidor was reborn in you, that means he's here for all of us. Should I maybe postpone my departure for a while to witness your exploits? Although..."
531050, "And to you."
531051, "*** He is ready to pay an arm and a leg for this twyre! Why would he need the brown variety? It causes nightmares, they say."

531058, "I will, I will. Don't you fret."
531059, "The herb is smarter than people, I've noticed that a long time ago. You have my regards. Now that we're on the brink of war, each blade will cost a fortune."

531069, "Twyre. Nothing else. Twyre can hold anyone."
531070, "I'll pay you back; you will be pleased as well, olgoy. Or how would you rather be adressed? Are you expecting me to call you 'oynon'...? That's what you're calling your elders, right?"
531071, "You can call me 'warden' or 'menkhu'."
531072, "You are wise, olgoy. Here is the money I've promised and the recipe that Isidor Burakh had prepared for Simon. He did it before going off into the Steppe. Why are you giving me that look? Do you know who Isidor Burakh is? This recipe is worth five years of your life, olgoy."

531078, "Business, woman. Not yours."
531079, "So Andrey will stay after all. Everything seems to be plain as day..."
531080, "*** The noblewoman makes a better offer. Who knows, this may well give us a reason to see each other again?"

531098, "Why the ambush?"
531099, "Well... I'm not just some bloke, as it turns out! Got a place in Capella's master plan, see? I'll start taking things on when she turns into the White Mistress. First I'll become the head of intelligence, but then... oh man!"

531126, "Farewell, Khan."
531127, "So goes the world. Capella is smarter than me, but she is nothing without military support. "
531128, "Time will tell, Kain."
531129, "You have Khan's consent. It didn't take him long."
531130, "That means he will leave the Tower tomorrow or the day after tomorrow-and so will his minions. You know how to make a lot of panacea already, don't you?"
531131, "Don't you worry about a thing."
531145, "'Who is Going to Feed the Dolly?'"
531146, "Murky is worried; she wants to get outside. What could have possibly made her this agitated?"
531147, "The doll is fed by one of the 'bull barrows'. Father said that these stones were here long before the first cattle-breeders arrived. The stones were used for some ritual needs and the bones that lay beneath make them easy to see."
531148, "It seems that this horrible freak of nature is none other than Murky's precious dolly. She looks well-fed. I may return."
531149, "'The Spirit Will Bow Before the Power'"
531150, "The Bachelor knows how to get inside this wretched Tower. He has been to the very bowels of it... which is something I do not require. I only need to go as far as the threshold."
531151, "The Kains are plotting something. They are a large family, and each one of them wants to live by their own will. It seems that both Capella and the Bachelor know of the intrigue these power games entail, whereas I don't give a damn."
531152, "Kaspar Kain doesn't look a pleasant fellow. I wonder what this hero will be like in ten years time... He has potential, but it suggests he should be held on a short leash. I can go back to Capella now."
531153, "*** So, the matchmaking was a success. Capella has moved the final figure on the board. A sad move... She was clearly trying to pick the lesser of two evils. It's strange how calm and collected the lad was. As if he always knew what was going to happen."
531154, "Would you do me another favour? There is more bad news. I'm not surprised anymore. Every crucial person will have to face a dangerous trial now."
531155, "Why do you care for this Murky anyway?"
531156, "When Murky grows up, she'll replace Saburova. She knows how to listen to the soil, and so she'll make a good Mistress of Earth-and the Rat Prophet's dirt-piling services will not be required anymore. Murky is clean."
531157, "Ok, I'll stop by at her place."
531158, "I've got other things to do."
531159, "Okay, I'll check on Murky."
531160, "I think it could benefit you too. Our paths are intertwined-and Murky guards the paths that hold a lot of exciting things."
531161, "...I have no idea."
531162, "Is that you? But she didn't come back..."
531163, "What does she eat?"
531164, "What is that doll to you anyway?"
531165, "No, she left on her own. She was hungry!"
531166, "Where did she go?"
531167, "She eats herbs that grow by the bull burial grounds. You know those? They have bullhead stones."
531168, "Mommy and daddy left her to me. She is the one listening to the Earth. Personally, I can hear almost nothing. She tells me everything. She's nice..."
531169, "So which stone is she by?"
531170, "No one knows for sure, but there were Worms there. Worms mean herbs."
531171, "Stay here. I'll bring you the doll."
531172, "Is this your doll?"
531173, "Here. Take this. It's not just a flask. There's blood in it. You know how to make medicine from it, don't you? Well, make some for yourself. Don't worry, it's no one's."
531174, "Where did you get this?"
531175, "I got it from a puddle near the Tower when I went looking for my doll. There's probably a whole lake there by now. The Earth is all damp. I felt it. I thought my doll could have gone to drink it."
531176, "No way..."
531177, "There's more where this came from. Go take a look."
531178, "If this is true, then I'll come back and ask you a few questions, so you stay here."
531179, "You're right. There is blood over there. What does this mean?"
531180, "I don't know. It happens from time to time. When we lived in the Tower, we used to think it was a bad omen. We began playing 'Marsh' or 'Coverlet' immediately."
531181, "It seems all the answers are there..."
531182, "Blood is emerging from beneath the Children's Tower? But where did it come from? Was this blood spilled within the Tower? It makes me wonder who resides there..."
531183, "Murky was telling the truth. This is amazing; the blood doesn't appear to be human... Nor does it seem to be leaking from inside the Tower... I should ask Murky if she knows anything else about this."
531184, "*** The story suggests a number of different conclusions... But something tells me this is not the time to jump to any of them. As the good old Bachelor would say: 'Let us just make note of the facts.'"
531185, "You are the mistress of the house. I'll speak to your guest first if you want."
531186, "Is that so?"
531187, "The soldiers are all over the place now. They won't risk staying in town for too long, but will rather return to the Polyhedron. I'm so thankful to you for helping Sticky out! You have my gratitude, Warden."
531188, "And who are these 'parts of your design'?"
531189, "Several kids. I told you before-and your father before that. The outcast children. Those who didn't fit in the Polyhedron and those who have left it willingly. Taya Tycheek, Notkin, Sticky, Murky, Grace. And... one more boy, but we'll talk about him later."
531190, "What do they have to do with the fires?"
531191, "The fires were put out! I don't really care about the fires themselves-in fact, I'm glad they're out. They made me feel terrified-and made the Town look truly doomed. Sticky is risking his life because of them now... What are they for anyway?"
531192, "Why do you need these kids?"
531193, "Your trust is touching. What's the matter?"
531194, "What do you think each one of them will grow to be? Can you guess? I can-Mother has whispered the truth to me in my sleep. The outcast children are destined to achieve great things. If in ten or twelve years they become Rulers... the Town will change beyond recognition! A new age will begin."
531195, "A pie in the sky... I don't believe in it. Sorry."
531196, "I see. So why did you call me?"
531197, "How is he risking his life?"
531198, "What for?"
531199, "Sticky is a brave boy. He thinks the Albino has something to do with the plague. He also knows the Albino is always following the same route. And Aglaya... shhh... ordered the fires to be lit just by that path. Oh, it's merely his way of putting his bravery to the test!"
531200, "Oh... And where is he lighting them up?"
531201, "Well, if he's so brave, he'll deal with it just fine on his own. And you should be thinking about your future."
531202, "Why?"
531203, "Eh... I can't tell you yet. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched. Ever heard that saying?"
531204, "I have."
531205, "Well, these are the words of an adult."
531206, "...Distance lends enchantment."
531207, "I have. Saw a bunch of chickens. Why are they so scared?"
531208, "Who knows... They're all taken up with their war. Maybe they plan to attack the army train? Khan must be going nuts for the cannons. He can see what is staring the Polyhedron in the face now. And he'd rather let himself be flayed than abandon the Tower..."
531209, "Come off it!"
531210, "Isn't he a little to young for this?"
531211, "Kain? Come on... No Kain is a trifle, pal. He's not too young."
531212, "They say he's knee-high."
531213, "Got it."
531214, "Stay. There will be exploits to witness."
531215, "Don't. We'll be better off without you."
531216, "Really? What if you're wrong though? Take the money. I give you what is due. The shop that will accept any goods at a high price is in the Stone Yard. Skirt The Crucible, walk towards the tombs, and you'll see a inconspicuous sign. Good luck."
531217, "The new. I've found something in my father's inheritance."
531218, "So? Are you saying that you're planning to brew new types of twyrine?"
531219, "Very likely."
531220, "Well, it's worth staying then. At least we'll see if you manage anything."
531221, "Nah... I haven't found anything new."
531222, "You aren't likely to get any."
531224, "By the way, what did you gossip with Maria about, tough guy?"
531225, "That's absolutely not your business."
531226, "She wanted me to make you two stay here for a while."
531227, "How?"
531228, "I have money. Tons of it. Four thousand in local currency. I want a mere nothing for it. I need brown twyre. Ten blades, no less. Straight, clean ones. No flaws. No colour. Preferably named... but that's optional. Brown twyre will yield to you, you are a menkhu. Deal?"
531229, "Why can't you buy it yourself?"
531230, "I had a... quarrel with the Worms. My dark game has been revealed... they basically went off and started killing each other for revealing their tribal secrets. I'm no longer trusted."
531231, "So why don't you just get down to business then?"
531232, "I don't need this. I'm a closed chapter already. I'll just grab my little brother-and to hell with everything else. We'll be all right."
531233, "What about the money? You'll just give it to me?"
531234, "Well, don't let the door hit you on your way out."
531235, "No way. Go to hell!"
531236, "What shop?"
531237, "Not so fast. Like I said, my sources are reliable. Victor won't let us down either. It's all cut and dried with the Kains... they've got no time for mercantile matters anyway. So overprice away. Well? What do you say? Huh?"
531238, "I don't get it. And how am I supposed to make a fortune by the evening?"
531239, "You don't get it? With my money you'll be able to buy a whole load of goods and resell them for three times as much... at a certain shop. I've got good sources."
531240, "So what's in it for me?"
531241, "I can imagine."
531242, "It's okay. Feast your eyes on it."
531243, "Why don't you do it yourself?"
531244, "Are you laughing at me? The herb doesn't yield to us. Tried it many a time. It conceals itself from strangers. I also used to think it was a legend or a myth or something, but... Ah, why am I explaining it to you of all people?!"
531245, "You are correct though."
531246, "It's a myth."
531247, "Of course I do. Your name is Burakh. Your visit hardly qualifies as a surprise. I am Yulia Lyuricheva, or Yulia, for simplicity. Do you have any serious aversion to cigarette smoke?"
531248, "It's all right. I got used to it when I was a student."
531249, "It doesn't bother me."
531250, "Indeed. You don't have the look of a man who is bothered so easily. And you don't seem to be too inclined to keep things tidy either."
531251, "That depends. Shall we get acquainted?"
531252, "I can't stand it."
531253, "Doesn't matter. I've noticed you were headed for the architects. Are you the man they asked to gather rare herbs for them before they hit the road?"
531254, "Yes."
531255, "That's not how you're supposed to address me. I am a menkhu."
531256, "Are you implying it's you?"
531257, "Isidor Burakh is my father."
531258, "Just get the money ready. And the recipe."
531259, "Damn! Missed it..."
531260, "*** I don't think that Tycheek's daughter was convinced by the story I told her. She is in a thoughtful mood; she seems to have forgotten about the bulls for now..."
531261, "Murky is just about to leave her van."
531262, "Could be somewhere around here... At least, there's something to eat there."
531263, "MURKY'S TOY. A remarkably ugly specimen. With pets like this, no wonder the girl is growing up gloomy and aloof."
531264, "What are you, an odongh? How did you manage to avoid the massacre then? I thought all of you were killed by the zealots three days ago, and the rest were locked up in the Termitary yesterday."
531265, "I come from a menkhu family."
531266, "Hush! Quiet... Listen to me, olgoy. The architects are planning to leave our town. I want them to stay. Tell Andrey you've managed to discover the secrets of old Isidor's brews. They're quite sought-after now-rumour has it, Saburov has seized Isidor's belongings."
531267, "I was promised money for this, actually."
531268, "I'll give you one of the recipes if Andrey demands proof. It costs a fortune, but I'm prepared to go to great expences for a deal like this. I'll also reimburse any lost profits to you, of course. You must be aware that I come from a rather wealthy family. Well? Deal?"
531269, "Are girls with good backgrounds really supposed visit places like this?"
531270, "No. You're confusing me with someone else, woman."
531271, "There's no need for you to know who I am."
531272, "But they can see us two whispering."
531273, "That's a ridiculous idea. Just look at them, their eyes are fixed on us. No."
531274, "Do you two come from the Capital?"
531275, "Yes. I am, you know... when we were invited here-that was ten year ago... twyrine was unheard of in the Capital back then. I came here for it. So fetch us more herbs, gatherer, will you!"
531276, "Who is it this time?"
531277, "This time Clara came to Murky-and now Murky wants to go outside! Clara did something bad to her. Murky is anxious now, I can feel it."
531278, "What happened?"
531279, "I don't know! Nothing at all, perhaps. All I know is Murky is very anxious. And she's not the type of girl to be easily scared by fairy-tales... you'll be the one scared of hers."
531280, "Seems like she can take care of this herself."
531281, "Forget the little sloven..."
531282, "Of course I will."
531283, "What would you do?"
531284, "As if they have dwindled since yesterday."
531285, "They have. Many of them got infected the day before... And Block made them distrubite their pills among the local population. Khan and the Bachelor also helped throw them out of balance. So there's that."
531286, "My hands aren't as strong as yours, but I can be dangerous, Burakh. I am a Mistress, don't you ever forget that. I know how to stand up for myself and I can make a criminal regret their actions."
531287, "So where is the girl?"
531288, "Perhaps the Commander can issue an order to let her go. Where do the military keep their prisoners? It must be in the Town Hall."
531289, "I can see that."
531290, "Oh, I see..."
531291, "Did Clara take her away?"
531292, "Who?"
531293, "The doll. Not Clara. My doll. My doll went off for a walk! Can you imagine? She probably went off to get food. She had nothing to eat... It's my fault."
531294, "Bah... what a loss..."
531295, "Hm... Are you sure about herbs?"
531296, "Don't worry. She'll have a bite and come back."
531297, "You see, I told you! And you wouldn't believe me!"
531298, "Where did it come from?"
531299, "Yeah, but what do you think? Personally?"
531300, "I think the Abattoir people may know what it is. All blood flows from there. They even make blood pudding there. And we aren't allowed to even think about the Abattoir. There."
531301, "So do the Tower's inhabitants know what it is?"
531302, "You poor doll... You are so tired... Have you eaten?"
531303, "Well, take care of her."
531304, "That is one freak doll. I don't know how I managed to carry it all the way over here."
531305, "'No one's' how?"
531306, "Attadoll!"
531307, "She is nice... She does no evil to anyone."
531308, "So, you got it by the Polyhedron?"
531309, "This much is enough for me."
531310, "Is it an aurochs?"
531311, "It's not a real Supreme. The last one was killed four days ago."
531312, "So, is it a spell then?"
531313, "It's not real, but it's alive. We need to get it off the bone. There's a sharp stake in its head! We definitely must take it off. It's hurt and that hurts us."
531314, "Is it dying?"
531315, "What should we do with it?"
531316, "That is so."
531317, "My Maria is currently in the same state. A bud that is about to blossom out into a stunning flower. A sun that has already shown an edge of its dazzling corona. We are now waiting for the sunrise. You are still missing a little bit. Perhaps it's only a matter of time?"
531318, "Perhaps."
531319, "You haven't changed one bit since my childhood, Judge."
531320, "What do you mean?"
531321, "Executors have told me that she was furious to learn of your discovery. She had her reasons-and she was quite intent on destroying you when you came to her. But she was so impressed by your dignified demeanour that she's had a change of heart. What did you tell her that touched her so much?"
531322, "We talked about freedom."
531323, "All right then. I'd like to ask for your help, Burakh. You are well aware that my business here is not complete yet-and now the Inquisitor has commissioned me to look for the source. She gave me a push in the right direction-as she did to you-yet I'm stuck."
531324, "Are my ears playing tricks on me? The oynon is stuck?"
531325, "I'm analyzing the soil... The results aren't great, but I've found something. There may be a paradox to the tectonic bed under the settlement. I need to know what its structure is like. I've heard that the Abattoir is rooted deeply into the ground. Tell me-do the people who live inside of it know what's below?"
531326, "You are wrong, oynon. Wherever did this theory of yours come from?"
531327, "You are a learned man, oynon, and I respect you for that, but don't speak of things you know nothing about."
531328, "That's none of your business."
531329, "Speak."
531330, "You are allowed inside, aren't you? Go ask them-find out what's down there! And if the source of the disease is indeed below, we'll overthrow this behemoth with armed force! The army will be here tomorrow."
531331, "Aglaya knows a lot, that's for sure. I wish you luck in your search."
531332, "That will depend on the findings, oynon."
531333, "There's no disease there, oynon. Don't waste your time."
531334, "I need proof."
531335, "Damn it! So what, am I supposed to go down there myself? And this is what I get after everything I've done for you, you ungrateful bastard!"
531336, "Easy there!"
531337, "No need for this, oynon. Calm down."
531338, "Whatever,"
531339, "My word is your proof."
531340, "I don't have any myself."
531341, "The Earth is sacred. Do not try to pierce it with your sharp mind."
531342, "Don't ask. You wouldn't understand anyway."
531343, "...Destroy, we need to destroy all this! Destroy and tear apart everything three versts down!"
531344, "No need to be rash."
531345, "...That would be murder."
531346, "Maria is coming into power. The Polyhedron will cease to be the republic of children soon. The toy will finally go back to its original purpose, and young Kaspar feels it. He's hesitating. I want to extend a friendly hand to him-and I need a middleman for that."
531347, "What?"
531348, "Tell him that I propose an alliance. In ten years-and he knows full well that this is how long it will take for my chapel to be built-he will have my hand. I will become his wife, and we will end the agelong conflict of our families."
531349, "Whoa..."
531350, "You are on good terms with the Bachelor, are you not? He fawns upon you a lot anyway. The Utopians respect him. He knows how to get there."
531351, "Are you absolutely commited to doing this?"
531352, "Yes."
531353, "You need me, Victoria, don't you? Speak up."
531354, "Why don't you ask the Bachelor to help you?"
531355, "The Bachelor loves Maria, and Maria hates me. He doesn't come here anymore. Even if I find a way to pass my request to him, Maria will expose me. I am going to be honest with you: there will be a new standoff of the Mistresses. I want to have Kaina's brother on my side when it happens."
531356, "You've changed all right. So what do you want?"
531357, "I don't want to have anything to do with this."
531358, "So you've found yourself a lucrative match already, haven't you?"
531359, "This is no laughing matter. I do not love Khan. I doubt I ever will. He is heartless. He is a Kain. Will you do what I am asking of you?"
531360, "How am I supposed to get to Khan? They won't let me in."
531361, "I'll think about it."
531362, "Okay, at least I'll peek inside that Tower..."
531363, "You won't see anything there. You're an adult."
531364, "Is that so?"
531365, "You can count on me."
531366, "Allow me to thank you. You will assume authority over the Kin soon. If everything goes well and I assume authority over the Town, we will rule together, you and I. Cherish my gift. Let it bring the soft memories back to life... the memories of the little girl that I used to be."
531367, "Thank you."
531368, "It all ends tomorrow. A single day can change a lot. I can sense almost nothing now-are my fosterlings fine? Can the mutineers kill the Inquisitor? If Aglaya Lilich falls-even destroyed by petty scheming-we won't be able to protect the Town..."
531369, "No, I don't need that."
531370, "What bull? Think about it, Burakh. There was no bull."
531371, "There was a Supreme One at the Bone Stake Lot."
531372, "I get your subtle hint."
531373, "The Bridge Square, you mean?"
531374, "I think you can see my point, Burakh. I gave the order to burn it because it was a nuisance that provoked unrest. Its huge body was filled with infectious spores. It was my duty, after all! Don't be stubborn. I'm not getting in your way, so don't you get in mine."
531375, "Ah! So you too have decided to defend that jewel with your life, haven't you? A worthy choice. It makes me happy to see you've come to it."
531376, "I have indeed."
531377, "I haven't. I don't care for the Tower whatsoever."
531378, "Okay."
531379, "By the way! Seems like Maria has fallen out of favour with her little brother. So if the password doesn't help, just tell them that I'm planning to save the Polyhedron and that I'm counting on you to help me with this. They'll definitely let you in then."
531380, "Then there is nothing I can help you with."
531381, "Fine. I'll side with you."
531382, "Never mind. It's no big deal if the girl doesn't get married."
531383, "Maria is out of her mind. Are you sure it's okay for you to relay the word to me?"
531384, "It's fine. She's fast asleep, gaining strength. She is getting ready to become a Mistress. Her hour is very nigh. And she is not out of her mind."
531385, "If you say so."
531386, "Khan won't listen to Maria."
531387, "Occupied."
531388, "Nothing, I'm just lost."
531389, "And what's that supposed to mean?"
531390, "It's the password."
531391, "Oh really?"
531392, "Okay. I'm here on the Bachelor's behalf. He swears he will save the Polyhedron."
531394, "Get outta the way, little prick! I am here on Capella's behalf."
531395, "You will not order me around, you whelp!"
531396, "You shall not pass, Burakh. This is exactly the situation where your strength is of no use whatsoever."
531397, "Damn..."
531398, "Heh, some games you have here..."
531399, "She wants to strike an alliance with you."
531400, "Children's alliances are not worth a dime. Is she willing to become my wife in five years? To submit to me?"
531401, "She is. In ten years though."
531402, "Tell the Olgimsky girl that I shall come. Let it be so. The proud Capella made the first move, and so she will have my support. She offers to strike an alliance-and we accept her offer. You have my word."
531403, "Yes. She told you to clear out of here."
531404, "Really? You're lying, Burakh. My sister is unconscious. She's communicating with Mother. Hopefully Mom tells her she's a self-centered idiot."
531405, "Yes, that would serve her well..."
531406, "In truth I came on Capella's behalf."
531407, "Being your ally seems like a dubious blessing at best... No way. Not going to happen."
531408, "Off you go, Burakh. You have no other business here. I'll deal with this on my own."
531409, "Yeah, right..."
531410, "Can you tell me what's going on?"
531411, "Capella would do it better. As to why I've agreed, I won't tell you. The Kains' business is not the Termites' business."
531412, "I'd love to teach you good manners..."
531413, "Go ahead and try."
531414, "Later."
531415, "They say traces of blood were found by the Polyhedron. My Dogheads claim they belong to the soldiers' victims, but I think they're lying. Tell me the truth: are there really soldiers down below?"
531416, "There are."
531417, "No. It was the earth bleeding, not people."
531418, "Indeed. I've been told this has happened before-the ground bleeds by the stem as if the Polyhedron is a cork stuck in a tube."
531419, "What should I tell Capella?"
531420, "What happened?"
531421, "The girls have reported that there's no longer a bull in the Bone Stake Lot... I thought he was taken off the stake. Was he alive? I'm worried! So you had nothing to do with it at all?"
531422, "You bastards..."
531423, "Stop with the shouting, will you... I'm leaving, I'm leaving."
531424, "Is this your doing, you blabbermouth?"
531425, "Okay, okay..."
531426, "I respect the people who do their job."
531428, "So?"
531429, "Do you even realise what kind of creature it was? Thousands of panacea samples could have been made from it!"
531430, "As an officer, I expect to be addressed as 'sir'. Self-respecting people address soldiers likewise."
531431, "I'm a Steppe man. There are no sirs in the Steppe."
531432, "So it was a deity, you swine!"
531433, "Are you sure these orders are being carried out? The whole town is full of contagious miasma!"
531434, "This order has certainly been."
531435, "Really? And who gave it?"
531436, "Well, seems like I should pay him a visit. Sorry for not sirring you."
531437, "Nothing to laugh at, Mother... Where is it?"
531438, "Now is not a good time for stupid jokes. I'm leaving."
531439, "The Bone Stake Lot. You know, the yard where a big stone sticks out from the ground. They say it's a splinter! Suok was walking there, but her leg got stuck, so she tried to free herself and has broken a bit off! That why any shabnak has pointy bones for feet."
531440, "Ah... See how anxious the commoners are, all astir... A dying aurochs have appeared in the Lot... Although the Foreman had supposedly killed the last one...? So... heh heh... He hasn't killed it to death then? Or what? Can it really be... something... supernatural, so to speak?"
531441, "An omen?"
531442, "Don't know... I don't know... Ask the torturer over there, heh heh... You be careful though! What if it's a trap? Foreman Oyun, you know... You two are locked in combat now... Pray forgive me... He could fix something like this... An ambush? Seems likely..."
531443, "I'll take a look."
531444, "What lot?"
531445, "I'm glad they're leaving you be-more or less."
531446, "Thank you, boös. Your help can prove to be invaluable."
531447, "Hang in there."
531448, "Curious. It's curious... I think it's a provocation. The bull is no doubt artificial. Therefore it's a bait. Keeping in mind the very obvious style, I think it was set by Foreman Oyun. So the bait is probably meant for you."
531449, "Seems likely."
531450, "Try to find out what he wants. He is expecting you to do something, but what? Maybe he wants to distract you and win some time? You know that every hour counts now... "
531451, "I have a bad feeling about this."
531452, "What would you advise?"
531453, "Speak to the torturer over there. She may have answers for you."
531454, "How are they treating you?"
531455, "So it was you that blocked the Termitary off?"
531456, "It's bearable. For now."
531457, "I wanted to keep the disease out. Would you have done otherwise? Remember your father."
531458, "Perhaps you are right."
531459, "That's more than nothing..."
531460, "Any wise advice?"
531461, "Nu huh. I won't offer you advice, but I'll offer you the answer to the question that you so desperately want to ask. 'Yes, of course.' As in, 'Of course he has to be.' As in, 'He has to be alive, but you don't really have to take him off.' Now think."
531462, "More talking in riddles, huh?"
531463, "Ordered by whom? Show me."
531464, "By general Block. 'Four hundred and thirteenth.'"
531465, "By the Inquisitor."
531466, "We do not fall under that swindler's jurisdiction. We have a direct commander. Farewell."
531467, "She has absolute powers."
531468, "Four hundred fourteen."
531469, "Dismissed."
531470, "....."
531471, "One moment... No. I can't vouch for someone like her."
531472, "You'll come to miss them later, you know."
531473, "Why did they bring you here?"
531474, "I won't let them burn anything! No way! You cannot burn that which belongs in the ground! How are they supposed to live afterwards? How will they spring? How will they come back to the sun? The body is sacred! Burning is even worse than cutting! You can't-you cannot burn the dead!"
531475, "Listen. They'll leave soon. You must give your word that you won't get in their way."
531476, "All right. I'll try to calm down if you promise you won't let them burn the most important body. You know what I mean? Go to the Bone Stake if you haven't seen the Supreme yet. You'll see a puzzle. It's meant for you."
531477, "A puzzle? Sounds fancy..."
531478, "And calm the Soul-and-a-Halves down! They're striving to guard the beast themselves..."
531479, "I need to get you out of here."
531480, "There's nothing to be done here. They're stronger. We have to accept that."
531481, "I know all that. I just wanted to know what you think."
531482, "No, I cannot promise you this."
531483, "I'm on my last legs, you know!"
531484, "No, I don't. What happened?"
531485, "A Sacred Bull appeared in the Lot! And it's likely-very likely-that it's the last aurochs on earth. Do you know what kind of beast that is? Clever, majestic, fearsome! It's like a dragon! A unicorn! A manticore!"
531486, "Calm down, will you... What's wrong with you?"
531487, "This is serious. What fate do you deem appropriate for the bull?"
531488, "It must survive no matter what! At all costs! I don't give a damn, I'd be the first to give my life for it! Just pull the stake from its head! Promise?"
531489, "Your life? Right..."
531490, "Hear your opinion loud and clear."
531491, "No way! Why don't I ever get to see one! I've been lying in wait at night for so many times, trying to see the odonghs bring a Supreme One from the Steppe! And it didn't work, not even once! Dang! So, what did it look like? Was it really that huge?"
531492, "Well... It was big for a bull."
531493, "Better tell me what I should do with it."
531494, "Is that so?"
531495, "And I think I wasn't the only one! An aurochs is a sacred beast. Whatever happens to it affects everything around. Why'd you think a Foreman has to learn the rite? Did your father even teach you?! Warden my ass!"
531496, "As you wish, Kindred One."
531497, "Why is it here?"
531498, "Give me some of its blood."
531499, "Since when is this creature also Bound to me? Wait... Or is it... What brand would you use to denote the beast?"
531500, "These juvenile games! 'Dolly' my ass!"
531502, "I need your help yet again. Same as ever; a friend is in danger! I am still forbidden to go out!/n/nV. O."
531503, "Capella's Invitation"
531504, "*** I should have kept my tongue in check! The Bachelor is going to suspect me now. It seems the fate of the miracle Tower hangs in the balance... Just like the Tower itself..."
531505, "*** Wrong password! No way I can get upstairs now."
531506, "*** I shouldn't have tried to bully this one. Bad move; way too emotional. No point in going back to Capella now. "
531507, "Signal fire."
531508, "Signal fire."
531509, "Signal fire."
531510, "Signal fire."
531512, "Who knows indeed."
531513, "Why?"
531514, "The sacrifice has to be proportional..."
531515, "So my udurgh is a person?"
531516, "What does that have to do with the udurgh?"
531517, "The one I have is enough for me."
531518, "...I'm not sure. He has a... labyrinthine way of talking."
531519, "That's absurd. An udurgh can't be a man. It's a body that contains the world."
531520, "Every person is a world-after a fashion. Simon was worthy of such a title more than anyone else. He was more than a man. And... is it really appropriate to talk about him like he's not there anymore?"
531521, "I don't know..."
531522, "I don't like your interpretation. I don't think you're truly sincere, oynon."
531523, "Really? I wouldn't believe the Foreman's words if I were you. I haven't met him, but judging by the rumours... he's not so happy that the son of the person whose place he had... usurped has suddenly returned. These are merely rumours, but..."
531524, "Wait... Do you know something that I don't?"
531525, "The Foreman is a Warden. He cannot lie. Farewell, oynon."
531526, "No, I don't like that new cunning wrinkle in the corner of your mouth."
531527, "As far as I remember, there is a separate entrance into Katerina's rooms. And her husband isn't the man he was a few days ago."
531528, "True. Fine, wait for me here then."
531529, "And what does Capella think?"
531530, "You wouldn't understand, oynon."
531531, "I don't know yet. I was just about to go to see her."
531532, "Is Capella a Mistress already? Although... it doesn't matter, it's of no importance at all. So, what's the answer? Can Simon be the udurgh? Is that even in the realm of possibility?"
531533, "Yes, he can. You seem to be right, oynon."
531534, "Well... Then the game is worth the candle. Even though it's going to be risky, I'll have to put my reputation at stake and triumph over the dreadful champion of the Skerries."
531535, "Please note that I'm not forcing the decision down your throat. I, myself, will keep going over this, thinking and rethinking. I only want to use your special case as an... additional argument, I think? It fills the empty spaces in my musings... just like that stone with ancient writings in three languages."
531536, "I see."
531537, "Are you trying to infect a healthy head with the morbid ideas of a sick one? Okay then..."
531538, "It is. But that doesn't mean anything."
531539, "You've lost me here."
531541, "The key to solving these contradictions lies in the Tower-the one you locals call the Polyhedron. It is clear that it's not what it appears to be to strangers."
531542, "What does my father's udurgh have to do with it?"
531543, "You're tearing the guts out of me..."
531544, "So eager to stick your nose into the Abattoir again?"
531545, "What's in it for you?"
531546, "Well, now it's glaringly obvious... "
531547, "Do not forget that finding the source of the disease is my main goal. You're not allowed into the Tower; I'm not allowed into the Abattoir. Let's help each other. I'll send you a note tomorrow. We'll make a deal."
531548, "Artemy Burakh, the surgeon, is hereby requested to report for service. Present yourself immediately at the headquarters of the Fourth Army Commander (located at the Town Hall)./n/nSigned/nMajor General Alexander Block"
531549, "A Message from the Temporary Headquarters"
531550, "The Commander advised me to go to the Abattoir."
531551, "The Commander, who arrived on today's train, has taken up quarters at the Town Hall."
531552, "She is dead!"
531553, "Go to the barrow."
531554, "What the hell did you want with that Tower in the first place?"
531555, "I have every reason to believe that the Polyhedron plays a key part in the history of this settlement. It's not actually a part of town... It stands on its own. Yet they do have an inextricable connection-one cannot last long without the other."
531556, "Salesman"
531557, ""
531558, "The twyrine den, the one on the riverbank. It used to be called Golghoy Khen, but was renamed later. This is where the meeting will take place."
531559, "*** I gave the herbs to the architect. Back to the Capital with him! Good riddance!"
531560, "My name is Artemy Burakh."
531561, "I am Kaspar, son to Victor Kain, but everyone who knows my temper well enough calls me Khan. And so will you."
531562, "I am the Foreman of the Abattoir."
531563, "I am a friend of Capella's."
531564, "Where? Oh... right. Everywhere. That's blood."
531565, "Long time no see..... friend."
531566, "Most venerable doctor! It is with great impatience that we have been expecting you. You need not delve into the minutiae of your business with us since our family is well acquainted with your scholarly work. We are also quite aware of the difficulties you were experiencing and well-prepared to do our utmost to support you. It hurts me all the more to be the one to inform you that Simon, my consanguineous brother, the creator, keeper and embodiment of all that surrounds us, has been murdered."
531567, "I can't believe it.....It cannot be!"
531568, "My brother was murdered last night, under the strangest of circumstances. But, for all the mystery surrounding his death, I'd rather eschew the notion that his... departure was connected with whoever had visited Simon that evening. The visitor is a man of laudable rectitude and an old friend of our family. There are witnesses to testify that he and Simon did nothing but converse."
531569, "Who was the visitor?"
531570, "Someone you know quite well. The man whom my brother saw last night was your colleague, Isidor Burakh. Was he not the the very person to advise you come here as well?"
531571, "Yes."
531572, "Hmm... Isidor has done more than he thinks... I have a lingering feeling that time itself is using uncontestable powers to further its own intentions. What do you think?"
531573, "I'm no fatalist."
531574, "It could be that my mind is clouded by sorrow, but I cannot escape the feeling that your arrival was no coincidence. Your choice was made for you, my dear doctor! Let us not blame... fate for it. Isidor wrote to you without making us aware. He took a risk that could have displeased our family."
531575, "Really?"
531576, "Even though we were uncertain of when you would arrive, my brother was looking forward to meeting you! The tragedy may have been a consequence of the actions he took in preparation for your arrival. Someone has taken a powerful piece from the chessboard; a piece upon which your position here depended. It is doubly regrettable that Simon was playing on your side..."
531577, "So you presume the queen knew of the blow and sacrificed itself for a pawn? But why?"
531578, "To grant you victory over death! Was it not your ultimate aspiration? To help you, Simon seems to have played a very dangerous game with... fate itself. He went out of his way to provide you with a body of evidence."
531579, "What did he do?"
531580, "It is of no importance to me what exactly he did. He took another leap for the stars and paid a terrible price for it. I repeat: he was murdered. The subject of importance here is the identity of the murderer."
531581, "Everything has gone to rack and ruin... I wish I could take vengeance upon the person who ripped the life from this man."
531582, "Do you want to help us, doctor? Find the murderer for us. My brother Victor, who is in the wing next door, would share some of his thoughts on the matter. Help us and the reward will not disappoint you."
531583, "Indeed. It seems there are too many coincidences. Your brother's murder can just as well be called the murder of Bachelor Dankovsky. I will help you in every way I can."
531584, "We will take our own measures. The only thing I expect from you is to be yourself. Do only what you think is required. Whatever you find out; whatever you do; whatever your day turns into; everything is a clue to the solution of this puzzle. I repeat: everything that is happening here is happening on your account."
531585, "Fine. I'm fine with this course of action."
531586, "You have my sympathy."
531587, "I need some time to get my act together. I suspect you are not aware that these developments render my whole lifework null and void?"
531588, "If that is indeed so, I feel obliged."
531589, "My sincerest condolences to you. Is there anything I can do to help?"
531590, "Why do you speak the word 'fate' with such disgust?"
531591, "I prefer the word 'time'. In a fatalistic sense of the notion, of course."
531592, "So Simon wasn't aware I would come?"
531593, "Categories like 'time', 'nature', and 'fate' deprive man of responsibility for what goes on around him. I was taught to avoid this worldview."
531594, "I would have told you that I'd been brought here by the hand of fate not so long ago, a naïve man that I was..."
531595, "Has it occurred to you that your brother could have died a natural death?"
531596, "It won't be easy for you to accept it as fact, but this fact is not subject to debate. My brother could under no circumstances have died a natural death."
531597, "Hmm..."
531598, "I'd rather not waste our time explaining the entire situation to you, even if it helps me substantiate the claims that you are justified to see as extraordinary. My dear doctor! I cannot imagine what kind of infernal aptitude the killer of Simon Kain must have. But Simon could not have died a natural death, so murder is the only feasible explanation."
531599, "I do not doubt that your brother could fight death like no other, but there was not and could not be an immortal man!"
531600, "The physiological paradox is obvious, I grant you, and I am not going to try persuading you otherwise. I am not a strong player in the field of academic debate. But I repeat: under no circumstances could my brother die a natural death. Immortality is the greatest secret humanity is forbidden to posses. Still, my brother managed to break the seal that locked it away from everyone else."
531601, "How?"
531602, "I will tell you who my brother was, and who he has become, if you find his murderer. For now, let me bring up the fact that Simon lived one hundred and fifty seven years without being susceptible to any kind of disease-no influenza, no pneumonia, no haemorrhage, no organ failures or malignant growths have ever plagued him."
531603, "Yes. I believe in that. I came here to witness the possibility of such a phenomenon; but immortality..."
531604, "To find the murderer? An unusual request... Or was it my colleague Isidor that recommended me as a skilled investigator?"
531605, "Well, fine! In any case, I came here to see a mystery, not a person. I am willing to sell my soul to you if you help me reveal it. How can I help?"
531606, "What kind of help do you expect from me?"
531607, "And you are implying that you can prove that?"
531608, "Dammit! Why did it have to happen just before I arrived? Right as I found the chance to prevail..."
531609, "Precisely. Why did it have to happen just before your arrival? Are you asking yourself this same question?"
531610, "I hope you don't see any connection between my arrival and the murder."
531611, "In fact, I do see a connection. However, do not mistake it for a thought that it was you who murdered him."
531612, "What do you know?"
531613, "Well, at least that's something..."
531614, "Who did it?"
531615, "That is what we want to find out. With your help, Bachelor Dankovsky."
531616, "What do you know?"
531617, "Who could possibly benefit from Simon's death?"
531618, "No one. That's the problem. Simon had no enemies. However, my brother Victor can shed some light on certain grim circumstances that have to do... How shall I put this...? With some preternatural relationship my brother shared with several people. "
531619, "I need no reward. This situation is my direct concern. I want to uncover the truth and I am willing to begin an investigation."
531620, "How many doctors are there in your town?"
531621, "If we exclude Isidor Burakh, Stanislav Rubin is the only doctor here. He's the most competent of Isidor's apprentices. The rest are good for nothing, as far as I can tell, they're only capable of distorting the knowledge their teacher is trying to pass to them..."
531622, "I'd like to speak to Isidor Burakh first and foremost."
531623, "Well... that is a reasonable thing to do. Moreover, that is what etiquette demands. After all, it was he that invited you here. However, I don't think he has informed anyone in The Crucible of these plans. I hope you don't get me wrong. You are our guest and we welcome you."
531624, "Where does Isidor live?"
531625, ""
531626, "Do you have any relevant experience? Do you know how a murderer may be found?"
531627, "Not really. But I hunt the killer of all killers in my laboratory."
531630, "Incidentally, it is more than possible that the killer is hiding in the house of Anna Angel; a thespian of sorts. Now, here is another woman worthy of attention. In fact, I heard some ghastly man covered in blood was seen entering her house today."
531631, "How do you know this?"
531632, "The town is a small place, Bachelor. The wind carries rumours with falling leaves; mixing birds' feathers with emotions. We all know one another so well here that we are sometimes able to hear each other's thoughts. A family trait, if you will. But that being said, I doubt that the man in Anna's house is the real killer."
531633, "Where does this Anna live?"
531634, "She lives in a mansion that once belonged to a family of exiles whose political views led them to a far out town like ours. Because of some ill-conceived sense of camaraderie they were happy to give shelter to a runaway actress-as soon as she told them she was persecuted by the Powers That Be. A few years later, they died-suspiciously if you ask me-leaving Willow Mellow, their daughter, in the care of their companion. Willow died soon thereafter."
531635, "Anna, huh... Well, I'll get to know her!"
531639, "No, I won't go there. I'm inclined to think that her visitor is another victim rather than the killer; and even that is unlikely."
531647, "What kind of woman is this Anna Angel?"
531653, "Looking for killers is the duty of law enforcement officers. I am only willing to assist them in any way I can."
531654, "I don't do killer-hunting. I'm a scientist."
531655, "So, you have travelled all the way here only to find that both people you wanted to see were brutally murdered? Is this how the story goes? I do hope that your visit is not in any way related to these most unfortunate circumstances..."
531656, "Not quite, but in any case I hope that getting to know me will not become a problem to you."
531678, ""
531679, "A foul murder occurred here this night. No unauthorized access allowed. Inspecting the crime scene is strictly forbidden until further notice."
531680, "You should have said so from the start."
531681, "Look, this is no place for you to be, sir. Could you kindly leave? Eh? The place is villanous, and times are rough... what if some thug or cutthroat comes after you? I can't protect everyone..."
531682, "I'm doing my job. You do yours."
531683, ""
531684, "So you've come to meet with Simon, haven't you? What can I do for you... now?"
531685, "I was actually invited by Isidor, so I came to meet with him first and foremost. But now it turns out that..."
531686, "There are very few good analysts in our town. Everyone is more or less superstituous here. Except for one Yulia Lyuricheva, perhaps; a most level-headed and reasonable person; the only person to remain sceptical about Katerina's talents, too. Without a shadow of a doubt, she has her own picture of events. She always does..."
531687, "Very well, I'll speak to this Yulia."
531688, "Nothing. Not anymore."
531689, "Do you have any weapons?"
531690, "They're going to lynch a woman, I think. There's this superstition circulating among the people-a myth of a maneater from the Steppe, a creature called a shabnak-adyr. Supposedly it can only take female form even though it's made up of all sorts of filth... Where are my patrolmen though?"
531691, "Where is this lot?"
531692, "I've yet to meet anyone who can help me in the slightest way to find the killer..."
531693, "I have to find whoever it is that killed Isidor and Simon, and I wanted to ask for your help. Saburov told me you have a gift for all manner of investigative inquiry."
531695, "Thank you, Yulia. What would I do without you..."
531696, ""
531697, "You have been sent to a ruler... and this is where you came... that's flattering. Simon, however, comes from a different family. The Kains are waiting for you."
531698, "Yes, I know."
531699, "Do you know the way? Do you have a map?"
531700, "Yes, thank you."
531701, "I will soon speak to you as well."
531735, "Yes... Getting everything back on track won't be an easy task..."
531736, "How do you think Simon died?"
531737, "I don't think he was murdered... How could he who craved monocracy not perish? He couldn't, not in this place... Balance requires equilibrium..."
531738, "So Simon's course of action contradicted yours?"
531739, "Come now... What I'm saying is... when someone takes too much upon themselves, they always end up... ground down. That's how life works."
531740, "Yet they say Simon was the one to bend the circumstances, not the other way round. No one seems to doubt that."
531741, "Simon has lived a very long life... Very long... He was a worthy man. But long doesn't mean eternal, does it? No one is to blame for his death... Examine the body, you'll see for yourself... It just happened..."
531742, "Kain won't let me examine the body."
531743, "Well, that is temporary... A family tradition... He' s not lying to you, he truly believes Simon was murdered. Were he to admit that Simon simply died of death... he'd probably go to his last home himself. The shock would be too much for the man..."
531744, "That's strange. Georgiy Kain didn't appear sentimental to me."
531745, "I'll follow your advice."
531746, "But there were signs of an otherworldly visitor that night, weren't there?"
531747, "So what you're saying is Simon's death worked in favour of the local hot shots, huh?"
531813, "Yes, it will be hard."
531932, "What are you implying? What is this 'manner' you're talking about? Be so kind as to mind your own manners... I had nothing to do with it... Don't they say Isidor was murdered by a Steppe demon? A shabnak-adyr? There was that thingie... a talon they fished out from the wound..."
531933, "Does he know the Steppe well, that son of yours?"
531934, "He rubs elbows with the rabble-the butchers, odonghe, shepherds and gatherers! Learns their tongue! Collects their legends! He doesn't keep them in check at all-they even dare to come visit him within the premises of the town! If you see a Worm creeping through the streets, he's definitely looking for my son!"
531935, "What's wrong with them visiting him within the premises of the town?"
531936, "They're dangerous, they're aggressive, and they hate everyone... who isn't a Steppe person. They'll jump you and kill you on the spot. They'll tear you up with their teeth and devour your flesh while you're still throwing fists at them! So if they're spotted within the town... counter-measures are taken."
531937, "So what of your son? Perhaps he could tell me more about this creature?"
531938, "Hold your horses...! You want to talk to my blockhead? No, you have nothing to talk about! He's not here... thankfully! I don't want you two to meet. You heard me? These are tradesman's words. And I'll stick to them!"
531939, "I won't leave it at that."
531940, "Eva, tell me, where does Olgimsky's son live?"
531941, "In the Lump... Oh, but wait...! Now that he's at odds with his father, he lives somewhere by the Station... There is an abandoned shack there. They say it's haunted. Vlad is probably listening to the ghosts. He is interested in folk convictions."
531942, "Thank you. I'll pay him a visit."
531943, ""
531944, "I have a very bad feeling... The same feeling plagued me just before my father died."
531945, "Lara, do you know where to find Olgimsky's son, Vlad the Younger?"
531946, "Yes, I do. He had a quarrel with his father and is now doing field work. I think he's in charge of some excavations, digging out monuments of the Steppe culture. He sleeps in an abandoned shack near the Station. It's close to the Guzzle, the upper tributary of the river."
531947, "You've been very helpful, Lara. Thank you."
531948, "I have a bad feeling too, although I'm generally not superstitious."
531949, "Now, sweetheart, please be so kind as to do me a favour in return. Tell me where Olgimsky's son lives."

531951, "That's better."
531952, ""
531953, "See how it all turns out... I used to keep this place secret, but all these secrets seem so childish now..."
531954, "Vlad, now tell me... did Isidor visit you last night? Tell me the truth please."
531955, "Yes, Isidor did pay me a visit, but don't ask what we talked about. I have no right to share that with you."
531957, "I don't know. There was a secret dissecting room in one of the warehouses, but no one knows where exactly. He used to live mostly in the Steppe-sometimes sleeping in the Termitary or at Lara Ravel's Shelter. But he's not there, I know that for sure. He went away to mourn his master. What would you have done if you were him?"
531958, "I'd wait for him at the Kains'. It's simple."
531959, "I would have resigned myself and left the place for good. My investigation is over."
531960, "I don't see anything special."
531961, "Don't worry about me. I know what Master would have done in my place. I'll just do the same as he did five years ago."
531962, "I'm counting on you."
531963, "Do you buy twyre?"
531970, ""
531971, "So, Steppe man, shall we do some muscle-flexing?"
531972, "I brought you herbs."
531973, "Flex away. I prefer watching the lady dancers."
531982, "You'll find out soon enough."
531983, "Time's almost up..."
531985, "Too late, Haruspex. To make this happen, I need to stand my ground in front of the Queens, and I won't be able to do that."
531986, "Why not?"
531987, "I don't give a damn. I might refuse to choose anyway."
531988, "...Oh relly? But it was you who have saved the Inquisitor's life... She won't let us destroy the Settlement. More importantly, she won't ever leave the Tower be for as long as she's alive."
531989, "Let it be so. See you at the Council. "
531990, "The time is almost up... Soon the barrage begins!"
531991, "Okay, I believe you. Go ahead."
531992, "I can't, Burakh. For this to happen I have to be at the Cathedral-or I won't be able to explain anything to the Inquisitor... and stop general Alexander if she manages to infuriate him. But I won't be able to come. It's too late..."
531994, "General Block will not shoot unless I tell him to-he has also put his faith in me. But the Inquisitor wants to see the Tower destroyed. She fill find a way to do so and will stop at nothing. When the Tower crumbles, so does childhood... And there'll be no utopia... It will be pointless then."
531995, "Agreed. See you in the Cathedral. "
531996, "If my confidants are alive, I will come to the Council with you, and there won't be a single Queen there that I won’t be able to convince to my cause! But are you absolutely sure they are alive? Do you really want me to come to the Council?"
531997, "Yes, I am sure all your Bound are well. Come to the Cathedral. I'll give you the right to decide. "
531998, "I'll think about it. Can't help the distaste I have for some of your adherents..."
531999, "If my Bound are alive, I'll be with you at the Council. Are you sure they really are alive? Do you really want me to come to the Cathedral and join the council?"
532000, "Yes. Your Bound are safe and sound. I'm counting on you, oynon."
532001, "I need to think it over."
532002, "'The Final Proceedings'"
532003, "The Bachelor will come to the Cathedral. He will stand up for the Polyhedron if I will allow him to make the ultimate decision. Should I? The Tower is alive, one might say, what with the soul of Simon forever sealed within it.../n/nCould it be that the Polyhedron is my udurgh?  "
532004, "The Changeling will come to the Cathedral. She is adamant that she can perform some kind of miracle to protect us all./n/nI have no proof of this possibility. Her miracle is an act of blind faith. And if I know anything about miracles, it's that they are all too often rotten on the inside."
532005, "I have made my choice. I have decided what the offering will be./n/nAglaya will live. The Powers That Be have nothing to hold against her, now that the cure for the Sand Plague has been found./n/nIt's of no importance to me what the Kin will think of my choice. If my refusal to offer a human being as a sacrifice means that they won't let me anywhere near the veins of the udurgh-I will find a different source of blood with which to make the panacea. The Polyhedron will be brought down and rivers of blood will spout from the gaping hole that is left by its foundation./n/nThe prophecy was fulfilled. The lines have led me to the place where my path as a Warden will commence. My father would be proud of me, I think./n/nAny choice is right as long as it is willed. This is how it is."
532006, "The tangle of lines has formed an intricate ornament. Something that before seemed quite obscure is now illuminated with meaning./n/nBy the will of my father, I should take care of these few children; my Taglur, as Victoria would say. However, it is not either of them that my father was referring to when he spoke of an udurgh. Rather, he referenced the town itself. The town, which exists only by feeding on the will of its inhabitants, just as these children were intended to be fed upon. They were destined to grow up to become the brain of the town, its lungs, and its heart./n/nIf these children see the Polyhedron as their home, it must be protected. Any choice is right as long as it is willed. This is how it is."
532007, "The town I remember so well has become a chimera. It is like a golem these days; a creature made of many parts; each part trying its best to destroy the other. Still, none of the parts may be removed: take an arm or a leg and the whole creature will perish./n/nAll my life I've been taught that nothing may come to pass without a sacrifice. Imagine a famished woman that goes into labour. Which one of them will live: the child or the mother? A choice must be made, otherwise both of them will die. This is-we're taught-the way of the world. There is never a third option./n/nAs I recall these tenets today, I feel all the more confused by their message. Perhaps Clara is right and the miracle is possible? Let it happen then, even if death will breathe down our neck ever after, waiting for a single misstep to plunge us into non-existence. Still any choice is right as long as it is willed. This is how it is."
532008, "Because I've sworn to save several lives that are Bound to me, that's why! You have your own Bound people, and I have mine. I'll try to help them somehow in what little time we have left..."
532009, "Are you confidants in danger?"
532010, "Some of them are gravely ill. They are on the verge of death. It's partly your fault too, Burakh... They wouldn't have fallen sick without your kind assitance, now would they?"
532011, "Fine. I'll check on your confidants and bring them back to life. How do I recognize them?"
532012, "Really? Well, you hold all the cards, Burakh. But remember that the people who are Bound to me want to save the Tower at the cost of the poisoned Settlement. C'est tout."
532013, "Not my problem, oynon."
532014, "Will you come to the Cathedral if they are alive?"
532015, "I will."
532016, "Good. I'm counting on you."
532017, "Well, best of luck to you."
532018, "Both issues are fixable. I know how to distract her thought process from this town. Will you be able to come to the Cathedral for the final council?"
532019, "Yes. Your efforts have allowed all the people who are Bound to the Tower's fate be alive and well. So... why not? If you tell Block yourself that you're on my side, the Inquisitor will be disarmed."
532023, "Why? "
532024, "Because I want several outcast Bound to live-the ones that no one would take care of and caress but me... You have your own confidants, I have mine. I'll try to do something for them in these last few hours..."
532025, "Are your confidants in danger?"
532026, "Some of them are gravely ill. They are on the verge of death. It's partly your fault too, Burakh... They wouldn't have fallen sick without your kind assitance, now would they?"
532027, "Fine. I'll check on your confidants and bring them back to life. How do I recognize them?"
532028, "My confidants are outcasts. Those who have accepted me as a new Mistress. They believe that I will be able to preserve the living Utopia. The town will remain the same. They will surrender their lives for that."
532029, "If they live, will you come to the Cathedral? "
532030, "I will."
532031, "Fine. I'll bring them to life."
532032, "Serves them right, the villains. "
532033, "So you've decided to play saint after all? Whatever..."
532035, "I'll make sure she doesn't get in your way. She is prepared to be sacrificed; that's her purpose. Will you come to the Cathedral for the final Council?"
532036, "So... Your efforts have allowed all the Bound who are willing to donate their transformed blood to be alive and well... I will be able to come then. If you tell Block yourself that you're on my side, the Inquisitor will be disarmed."
532038, "Let them shoot. I wish this was over and done with as soon as possible."
532040, "So there's a certain deposit beneath the Town that would allow you to make enough panacea? Rumour has it it's... blood?"
532041, "Indeed."
532042, "I've seen a report claiming that the Kin will not let you have this blood unless you kill the Inquisitor. Is that true?"
532043, "It is."
532046, "How are you going to kill her?"
532047, "I'm not. We will destroy the Tower. The blood will pour out from the tear in the ground. That will be enough."
532048, "You believed Clara? You pass the right to decide to her? I want the Inquisitor to hear this."
532049, "Yes, I believe in her."
532117, "I have monomycine. That could help them live to see tomorrow."
532118, "They will see midnight. The diseased will peek out from the other world for a little while today. I'll put them to sleep at midnight again. Give me the medicine and come in."
532119, "I'm going in."
532120, "I have feromycine. Give it to the diseased."
532121, "It will ease their pain for a little while... You will be able to talk to them today. Come in."
532122, "I'm going in."
532185, "Let it be so."
532187, "No. All I know is that Isidor was with him that evening. No one can enter the Focus against Simon's will! Well, perhaps a higher being could-but no one else."
532188, "Just take a look around. Trust your intuition. Do whatever you like, speak to whoever you feel the need to. Look for the murderer, doctor, and you will find them. Keep looking till the last breath... I am sure your rational thinking will help you."
532189, "So Isidor is the only lead. How can I find him?"
532190, "I'll show you, but you must be careful. Simon's murderer, whoever they are, could not be an ordinary person. I can't imagine them even being... a person. I fear it could only be fate, wearing the guise of a mysterious monster."
532191, "I don't believe in fate."
532192, "I will be careful."
532193, "A cunning lot, aren't they? The older Olgimsky does his best to avoid any mention of his household. When I asked him what his son was doing, the honourable stock-breeder momentarily lost his temper. I think that the son knows just as much as the father, and it will be easier to get him talking. But where can I find him?"
532194, "The investigation of the double murder has introduced a few additional considerations. It is highly possible that Simon died to some unfamiliar disease. Stakh Rubin, the town medic, should be warned at once. If he touches the body he may contract whatever disease still remains there! "
532195, "We have identified the killer, although we've yet to apprehend him. Rubin will collect the necessary equipment to protect him as he works with the bodies. In the meantime I should inform Georgiy Kain of what the primary investigation has shown."
532196, "*** The initial findings suggest that Simon Kain was killed by a highly contagious disease. It seems I will not be the first to meet the killer; Doctor Rubin has better chances at that. I just cannot help but think that were Katerina's prophecy to come true, it would have made the situation even more convoluted than it already is."
532197, ""
532198, "You haven't seen Simon yet, have you, Bachelor Dankovsky? But today you will, that much is certain."
532199, "I wanted to speak with you first."
532200, "You can't. It's impossible. You need to go to the Crucible first and come see me later. Otherwise you won't believe me."
532201, "Fine."
532202, "I don't believe anyone anyway."
532203, "I was on my way to see him."
532204, "You are a brave man, Bachelor Dankovsky."
532205, "Why?"
532206, "This fight... is very unlikely to end in your favour. Does a clay-and-bone maneater leave traces of the kind you've witnessed? It's only a spell, an illusion... They just prefer to see it this way... it makes it easier for them."
532207, "'Fight' is too big a word. I'm merely assisting Georgiy in his efforts to find the murderer."
532208, "I'm sorry to break it to you, but you will have to fight to the death. Even if it were a metaphor, the ending is still unambiguous. If you don't find out what happened before nightfall, you will die..."
532209, "How do you know all this?"
532210, "I'm clairvoyant."
532211, "What's the nature of your visions?"
532212, "This should not be your primary concern at the moment... you should concern yourself with the number of minutes you have left. And that number is dwindling... I don't throw predictions around. Others will tell you how often they have come true. Do heed my words..."
532213, "Fine."
532214, "Time will tell."
532215, "Thank you for your help."
532216, "I'll take that into account."
532217, "What maneater?"
532218, "So you know the details of my fight in advance?"
532219, "If you don't point at the killer... by nightfall, then the killer will strike you down as well... You simply won't be able to recognize them. You won't notice them crawling up to you... Somehow you'll be very surprised upon seeing their face... and that will leave you paralyzed."
532220, "Curious."
532221, "You are overestimating my virtues."
532253, "Oh the torment... I can't bear it..."
532338, "Why don't you take some painkillers then?"
532343, "I've found out more about our morning visitors! They turned out to be runaways. Can you imagine?"
532344, "Where could the runaways be hiding?"
532345, "In a hospice in Earth. Well, 'hospice' is just a name, really... What, are you planning to visit the place? Then help them escape into the Steppe before Vlad sends mercenaries after them! That would be a good deed. We've had enough murders, haven't we?"
532346, "True. I'll see what I can do about it."
532347, "I'd rather speak to Vlad the Younger about this. Do you know where he lives?"
532348, "No! He'll probably try to hire you to do the killing, and that is no good. He is so rich and clever! He'll think of something to persuade you... Send them to the Steppe, that will be better. Warn them about the danger! I'll tell you how to find Vlad if you do that. Please..."
532349, "Fine, as you wish."
532350, "Do not judge the deeds of men, woman. That is none of your business."
532351, ""
532352, "What do you want, I wonder?"
532353, "There's a runaway hiding here. Take me to him."
532354, "Why would I?"
532355, "He's in danger. I'm here to help."
532356, "He's a butcher. He won't talk to you. You wouldn't understand him. He's been here for more that a day, but even I can't get him to talk. It is I who'd rather tell you something..."
532357, "What do you want to tell me?"
532358, "Big Vlad has plugged the Termitary up for a reason. The butcher's mumbling is all over the place, but if you listen carefully, you'll make out tales of such horrors that I get shivers all over. Thousands of people have lost their minds all at once there. Many have died. Something's brewing inside..."
532359, "Can you lead the runaway out of town?"
532360, "Really? Why? Here he's entertaining me-and it's dangerous to go out into the Steppe anyway. What if his pursuers rip me apart in the street? What if they think I'm a shabnak-adyr? What can you offer me in return for the service?"
532361, "Lead him out or he'll get killed. You can show me the door if you want, but thugs for hire will be less compliant."
532362, "What do you want?"
532363, "I'll ask a small favour from you in four days. Don't worry, you won't have to cut your arm off. Will you do it?"
532364, "I will."
532365, "Fine, I'll take care of the butcher. He'll disappear. Consider him non-existent. But now you must leave. Don't try watching the door, you won't see anything anyway. And tell the Olgimskys' thickheaded bloodhounds that they have no business here, I harbour no killers!"
532366, "Deal."
532367, "No. I want to take care of the man personally."
532368, "In four days I'll be in the Capital."
532369, "No you won't. You'll either be six feet under or here with us. Well, if you do get to the Capital, consider my request cancelled. Deal?"
532370, "Deal."
532371, "No. I want to take care of the man personally."
532372, "There's no need for that. I'll speak to him myself."
532373, "Take me to the butcher. I'll interrogate him personally."
532374, "Are you sure? Have you forgotten that he's crazed? If you think he'll communicate with you, you are mistaken. They aren't great talkers anyway-and they can only howl, growl, and bawl when they're under a spell."
532375, "I can hold my own."
532376, "Go then. The butcher's in the hospice-the entrance is at the other side of the house. Don't come back here complaining afterwards though."
532377, "I'll deal with it."
532378, "Fine, then lead him out of here yourself."
532379, "How did they die?"
532380, "Dunno. Can't tell."
532381, "The butcher will tell me anyway."
532382, "He's dangerous."
532383, "Was it Vlad the Younger that dropped you a hint about a killer hiding here? That little spider! He simply respects his father and doesn't want to wash the dirty linen of his family in public."
532384, "The dirty linen? Do explain."
532385, "I need to ask him a few questions."
532386, "So, uh, you live here, huh?"
532387, "No, I don't. But seriously, what brings you here, sir Outsider Doctor?"
532388, "I just wanted to inspect the house."
532389, "No one here is ill. In fact, there is no one here that could be of interest to you in any way. You're looking in the wrong place, doctor..."
532390, "There are runaway fugitives here though."
532391, "Vlad the Younger has a different opinion."
532392, "You're concealing a killer."
532393, "Your veins are all swollen... Does being close to me make your blood stir?"
532394, "Was there anyone around that would want to see Simon killed?"
532395, "Heh... No one's seen the shabnak yet, but everyone knows what he wants already. Do you know that a maneater's victim feels the encroaching death? They know in advance they're next on his list. And so they walk about restlessly, waiting and waiting and waiting-and then the wait is over! That's how you can tell who's being hunted."
532396, "You don't say..."
532397, "It's like an internal countdown. You count how much you've got left. So scary! It's nice not to think about stuff like that..."
532398, "If you don't stop spewing senseless babble, you'll be next. That's called autosuggestion."
532399, "Bite your tongue!"
532400, "Stop swearing."
532401, "Thanks for the suggestion."
532402, "Real mature..."
532403, "But I suspect you are thinking already-unless you're immune to it."
532404, "Why are you calling her a 'he'?"
532405, "I don't believe the maneater is a woman. Anything is possible, of course, but I think it's sexless."
532406, "You seem to be well-informed."
532407, "I think you fit this description very nicely."
532408, "Anyone could become a victim of this hunt. You don't need to be a prophet to know that."
532453, "Aren't you a funny girl."
532457, "I must find out if the killer is hiding in the doss-house at the opposite side of the building. The butcher must be there right now."
532458, "I've done as you asked. The butcher has been guided into the Steppe."
532459, "I had no doubts you would... You are no killer."
532460, "Only to make you happy."
532641, "Bachelor, I have news for you that should prove to be of interest. You seem to be looking for the killer, right?"
532642, "I'm listening."
532643, "I'll have to briefly explain a few things to you. Have you already been told what the Termitary is?"
532644, "Yes, I've heard about it."
532645, "Let's get to the point then. A case of pointless, aimless unrest has occured in that hivemind's nest. The workers there are prone to lashing out from time to time like beasts frightened by a storm. They rage, they howl, they gnaw at one another... an unsightly image of a mass uprising."
532646, "What does this have to do with Simon's murder?"
532647, "Riots occured in the Termitary several times before. The mob goes crazy for a few days. Then they calm down just as unexpectedly-all of them at once. The sudden calm is just as void of reason as the unrest that had set them agog previously. Having a certain experience with the Kin, we simply block the entrance to this zoo off until the riot defeats itself."
532648, "And?"
532649, "We usually lock them up beforehand. The evidence of an upcoming outbreak of mass lunacy becomes obvious in advance, and the Termitary's Father Superior informs us of it. But Father Tycheek has recently passed... a curious coincidence, don't you think? Mass anarchy... Anyway, a member of the Kin managed to run off into the town while we were busy taking measures."
532650, "You think he is the killer?"
532651, "I think you and I can help each other, doctor. You are looking for the killer, and I'm sure it is a runaway butcher. The title of a 'half-man' suits him very nicely. The Kains claim that Simon had not been killed by a human hand, don't they? And our family doesn't need unnecessary unrest in the town. This butcher can babble devil knows what. His mind is most likely clouded with insane ideas..."
532652, "So you'd rather he kept mum about what is happening inside?"
532653, "You are correct. They barely know how to speak, but that only makes it worse... Halfmen, halfbeasts-if they start preaching, you feel as though you've encountered a doomsayer. I need this butcher to disappear. Hand him over to the Kains or simply kill him if the beast attacks you. The reward will be hefty."
532654, "Very well, I'll look into this. Where can I find him?"
532655, "He is most likely being harbored in a suspicious house... that's in the Crude Sprawl... Yes. My father is a man of rather hard-handed disposition-and quick-tempered to boot. If he finds out the Crude Sprawl is concealing a fugitive... he will make a mess. Pointless brutality serves no one. I'm looking for peace rather than blood, I'm telling you."
532656, "I'll do my best to make sure you're right. Show me the house."
532657, "I thought you treated native people better..."
532658, "Are you taking me for a thug or something?"
532659, "I'm taking you for a person that's looking for the killer and has the authority to punish him. I'm telling you-there is a rebellious outlaw beast out there. If he attacks you and you're forced to defend yourself, you are free to kill him."
532660, "Where can I find this monster?"
532662, "I think your family has the means to send someone who is a better killer than me."
532663, "Why is your family so concerned about public order?"
532664, "Because we are rulers. It has nothing to do with charity, trust me. We are in charge of production, after all. If the unrest becomes serious, the factories will stop. The Project will start failing... And we have contracts. We would lose money. I'm surprised I have to explain this to you."
532665, "I understand. So you don't want the runaway to spread unrest among the already scared townsfolk with his words, right?"
532666, "Where do I look for this runaway butcher?"
532667, "How did he die?"
532668, "How should I know? A disease most likely... or an accident or something. That is beside the subject at hand."
532669, "What is the subject then?"
532670, "A disease?"
532671, "Could be flu or a hernia... I don't know what caused his death, and, frankly speaking, I don't care. When one of these ants dies, the rest loot bits and pieces of him, burying what's left afterwards. Are you asking out of professional curiosity?"
532672, "Sort of."
532673, "So why are you telling me all this?"
532674, "What is this Kin?"
532675, "The Kin is... well, doesn't matter, it's hard to explain. Their whole so-called society. The many-headed biology."
532676, "Very well, let's get back to the subject."
532677, "And that is exactly what's going on there right now, isn’t it?"
532678, "Precisely."
532679, "And why are you telling me this?"
532680, "No, I haven't."
532681, "The Termitary is a huge bunkhouse where the Bull Project workers live-although 'living' is the wrong term for it. They nest. They're nesting as a commune with a rather simple way of life. It could without reservation be called savage."
532682, "And?"
532683, "What is the Bull Project?"
532684, "It is the whole industrial system of the town, from the Abattoir to the goods station. Would you care to listen as to why I wanted to see you in the first place?"
532685, "Very much so. Please go ahead."
532686, "I would like to hear you describe it."
532687, "You are mistaken. I am not looking for any killers."
532688, "Hmm, seems like I was misled. I apologize. If you find yourself interested in this in the future, do keep in mind that I might have a clue."
532689, "Perhaps I'm interested already. Please tell me."
532690, "All right. I'll keep that in mind."
532691, "It's over. The butcher is dead."
532692, "...That's the best news I've heard in the last few days. So it was him that killed Simon, right?"
532693, "I doubt that. He's too dumb for that. But he was definitely insane and very dangerous."
532694, "Well, it's for the best. And now I want you to listen to me, doctor. I hold too much respect for you to offer you a reward for this rather... extraordinary service. So please accept this money as a donation from the town's rulers to you-a sign of our support for someone brave enough to commit to your difficult task. Capturing the killer is our direct duty. Please consider this sum to be the Olgimskys' contribution to our common cause."
532695, "This is acceptable if you put it that way, but only that way."
532696, "No need for excuses. I was risking my life, you are compensating me for the risk. We are business people after all. Give me the money."
532697, "This is an insult. When I offer my services for sale, I make that known beforehand."
532698, "Yes, it was."
532699, "Fine. Where can I find this butcher of yours?"
532700, "He is most likely being harbored in a suspicious house... that's in the Crude Sprawl... Yes. My father is a man of rather hard-handed disposition-and quick-tempered to boot. If he finds out the Crude Sprawl is concealing a fugitive... he will make a mess. Pointless brutality serves no one. I'm looking for peace rather than blood, I'm telling you."
532701, "I'll do my best to make sure you're right. Show me the house."
532702, "What do you think about Simon's death?"
532703, "Hmm... It is known that Simon had limited his social activity just before his departure. He only received two visitors. I know nothing of the first, but the second was none other than Isidor Burakh. The fact that he was killed the same night makes you think, doesn't it?"
532704, "The killer took out a witness?"
532705, "Or an accomplice. Isidor was a complicated man. Have I told you about his position in the Kin? He used to be a very well-respected person there... and I can't say everyone liked it."
532706, "What do you mean?"
532707, "Isidor wasn't a doctor... he was more of a herbalist. He never studied medicine-all his recipes were about plants and roots, so to speak. He was knowledgeable, true. A sorcerer, if you will, but a very different one from Simon. An earthen sorcerer."
532708, "I've never heard that Simon used to be a sorcerer before..."
532709, "Simon was a theurgist. Isidor was a witch doctor."
532710, "And you think Isidor the witch doctor has managed to achieve the unachievable? A possible theory, but rather questionable."
532711, "I'll start speaking your tongue myself soon..."
532712, "Why would a doctor kill someone?"
532714, "Could it be that the killer is hiding in the Willows, where the singer Anna Angel resides? After all, someone covered head to toe in fresh blood was recently offered shelter there."
532715, ""
532716, "What d'ya need, kind sir?"
532717, "I'm looking for Grace. Where is she?"
532718, "You bring two thousand here, kind sir, and we'll bury the devil himself and sing a pretty tune for you to boot. Gotta put even the shabnak-adyg back into the ground for two thousand. The sum ain't pretty, I know, but the times ain't killer on the looks either. I can show the kind sir a way out, by the way..."
532719, "Like hell I will. Take the cash. The dead man is in Anna the singer's house."
532720, "It looks like I'll have to follow your advice."
532721, "I've got the money here."
532722, "Aha, aha... Lovely. Where's the freshie?"
532723, "At Anna Angel's place. And hurry up."
532724, "Just looking around."
532725, ""
532726, "And who might you be burying, dear sir?"
532727, "Are you the caretaker of the cemetery?"
532728, "These greedy gravediggers aim to make as much as they can by providing unwarranted burial services. Two thousand. And the rascals had the temerity to suggest I pawn some of my belongings to round up the cash!"
532729, "I know you're a doctor. A wonderful one at that. A celebrity medic. Everyone in our small town knew that a famous doctor was coming here. I'm very glad you really have-because I want you to do a certain good thing. Can I ask a favour of you?"
532730, "Do people around here ever leave their doors unlocked?"
532731, "In exceptional cases or emergencies-yes, we do. But generally houses are supposed to be locked up, because they're occupied by several families. People aren't that scared of losing their own belongings, but they care about their neighbours. And now that everyone's so afraid of the maneater... of course everything's locked."
532732, "In that case it won't be too hard to find."
532734, "I've changed my mind. Your stories are indeed troubling. So how do I find that house?"
532735, "Capella mentioned it's next to one of the ruins. My friend couldn't hear them properly... Have you seen those stone Stairways to Heaven? I think you might even be able to see the house you're looking for from Eva Yan's window. But most importantly, it should be unlocked."
532736, "In that case it won't be too hard to find."
532737, "Well... I've found it. Unfortunately, the cache has already been looted..."
532738, "Give it to me! Let's throw it into the fire! I'll reimburse you for this loss..."
532739, "Well... fine. Let it be as you wish."
532740, "No, I'll keep it for myself. Somehow I feel like it may be of use later."
532741, ""
532742, "May I inquire as to how you've found this place, sir?"
532743, "How are children supposed to cure themselves then?"
532744, "Children? All children should come to our Polyhedron. They'll be safe there."
532745, "All right, I get the general gist."
532746, "We would have called you to come by to our place, but we can't... No adults allowed."
532747, "That's fine, I'll live with that."
532748, ""
532749, "Oh man! Oh man! I told them to escape straight away without tossing a coin!"
532750, "...What is the First Outbreak?"
532751, "Five years ago something really creepy happened in the Crude Sprawl. People fell sick one after the other-and rapidly, too. The whole district got infected in twenty four hours, house after house. People would burst into sickness like matches burst into flames-and then, like matches, they would burn from the inside. I was a little kid back then, only six years old, but I frequented the Tower already."
532752, "And then what?"
532753, "Relax, it's only a mask. Nothing to gawp at, really. We put them on for the intimidation factor."
532754, "I'm not gawping. And I'm completely relaxed."
532755, "Georgiy Kain agreed to delegate his authority to the head of the Saburov family."
532756, "Vlad Olgimsky agreed to delegate his authority to the head of the Saburov family."
532757, "They are in concordance with one another; not a moment too soon. I can go back to Alexander now, for I still have to present my official papers to him and discuss my further authority. I am bound by the power of my word. Whichever shape the enemy assumes, the substance of our confrontation remains the same."

532772, "Yes. I'm going to need your help soon."
532773, "Yes... It was a terrible battle. When is this war finally going to end?"
532774, "Listen to me. Your main quest is stay at home for now-otherwise you'll get infected and die. Do you believe me?"
532775, "Like an angel of death or something?"
532776, "Yes... something like that... I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic. If you are, then allow me to say I do not share your feelings."
532777, "I apologize. And how did Simon himself get in there?"
532778, "All right... Who among the townsfolk can help me with this?"
532779, "My daughter will advise you better there. Her name is Maria. For several days she's been obsessed with some design... that is somehow related to your arrival. Yes, don't be surprised, she knew beforehand that you were coming."
532780, "I'm not surprised."
532781, "I'll find explanations for everything that's going on here-eventually."
532782, "Really? That's good... Anyway, Maria believes that several Bound people will play a special role in your fate. Before you leave this place, of course. Perhaps it is them you should ask for help first?"
532783, "First I'll seek help from my dear colleague, Isidor Burakh. Where does he live?"
532784, "I'll look for the murderer myself, using my intuition. I don't need anyone's help with this."
532785, "Yes."
532786, "I see. Well, I respect the prudence of your honourable relative. If he insists, I'll continue to work blindfolded."
532787, "Cut with the silliness, good sir. I can take care of myself."
532788, "You're a bore, mate. Let me through."
532789, "...Indeed? So you've already made it as far as The Willows... which is what her mansion is called. Well, used to be called-before the willows withered. You are quick to make new acquaintances! So what do you make of this lady?"
532790, "Suspicious. Hiding something. Lying."
532791, "A charming person. She's a singer, right?"
532792, "Aren't you alarmed that there's a dead body at her house? She failed to explain where it came from. I would put her on the list of suspects."
532793, "Curious... She came to that house as a fugitive six years ago... It is hers now. The family that had given her shelter went on to disappear in a rather distasteful manner. The owners succumbed to a fatal disease... that had struck them rather suddenly. And their daughter, Willow, simply vanished."
532794, "And now she's asked me to get rid of a dead body and keep it secret! I think we ought to interrogate her."
532795, "What kind of a person is this Anna?"
532796, "I know very little about her. She's been living here for quite some time, but she is very secretive... My daughter has told me that she likes to be the centre of attention, male attention in particular-and yet she doesn't socialize much and is rarely to be seen in public. It's as if she's hiding."
532797, "We should arrest her, just in case."
532798, "What kind of disease?"
532799, "A peculiar kind of pest broke out among factory workers five years ago. Not here but in the poor districts. Isidor took care of it quickly. There were many deaths, but only in the Crude Sprawl-a district that borders on the Abattoir. But The Willows is on the riverbank; the infection never made it that far. An odd story, don't you think?"
532800, "Very odd. We should arrest that singer. Perhaps she's killed the hitman and is now covering her tracks."
532801, "No, not really. Leave the singer be for now. It's better to watch her for a while."
532802, "A certain beggar."
532803, "The caretaker's been pushing up the daisies for, lemmethink, five years now. Turned to grass already, all excited to bask in the sun. Me, I'll have to endure them hardships for a long time still."
532804, "For a long time, you say? Who knows..."
532805, "I'm here on... burial business."
532806, "Where's him stiff?"
532807, "You ought to be a bit more respectful to the deceased..."
532808, "You'll have to go fetch it. It's not far, in a mansion on a riverbank."
532809, "Another one, is it... Who did the favour? That shabnak running rampant? Heh, that's the kind of lady that ain't going nowhere until she's had her way with you."
532810, "Shut up, digger."
532811, "Oh man...! You'd better speak to the Hunchback over there. He's the boss."
532812, "You should have told me so straight away."
532813, "You stupid people..."
532814, "My name is Daniil Dankovsky. What's wrong with my outfit?"
532815, "That is precisely the question I was going to ask you..."
532816, "Everything! Everything's horrible! You came to... You know... after me, right?"
532817, "I'm Anna Angel. You might have heard of me already. Oh, I used to be a famous singer! You can't even imagine the stages I used to be the star of!"
532818, "I'm Dankovsky, Daniil Dankovsky. You might have heard about me too. I'm the head of the Thanatica laboratory."
532819, "Try me."
532820, "Well... I used to play on tour mostly... Yes, they could've forgotten me in the Capital by now. But that's not important now anyway! I will probably die today. You see what happened?"
532821, "It's snakeskin! Are you a performer? A circus actor? A tamer? Tell me the truth!"
532822, "I am a tamer... after a fashion."
532823, "No, I'm a hunter."
532824, "Calm down. I'm a scientist. A professor, do you understand? I study death."
532825, "I thought so! I knew someone like that would pay me a visit very soon! How horrible..."
532826, "What's horrible?"
532827, "What happened? Tell me."
532828, "I see that everything's fine."
532829, "Hush, hush! Be quiet."
532830, "Yes, that is why I'm here."
532831, "I have no idea what you're talking about."
532832, "Of course not. How could you think something like that?"
532833, "Now for the traditional one. Do you suspect anyone?"
532834, "I have every reason to suspect that a few of my compatriots know the answer to this murderous riddle. My brother Victor seems to share my opinion: some of the townspeople know a lot, but, for a variety of reasons, they will never reveal what they know to a Kain. You, on the other hand, they will be only too happy to talk to."
532835, "Fine, let's leave that subject. I want to know the details. The facts."
532837, "Let us leave mysticism aside."
532838, "We have no choice but to resort to mysticism. There are patterns of a kind that we cannot rationally explain, that are woven into the very fabric of our existence... as if they were veins and we were flesh. This may be an affront to your intelligence... but I cannot help you with that. There are a lot of things about this place that you are very likely to find disconcerting."
532839, "All right, I'll speak to Victor. Where can I find him?"
532840, "My brother Victor will see you in the other wing of the house. He will also discuss your reward with you."
532842, "It is all too sudden. I need to think it over."
532843, "You need an investigator here, not a doctor."
532844, "What we need here is someone well versed in logic and analysis. Even better: someone whose judgement is not influenced by deep knowledge of our local affairs. Our past gets in our way. The clarity of your perception will allow you to assess the facts without prejudice. Treat this as an intellectual puzzle. Moreover, I feel that this murder is a message intended for you personally, even though I don't blame you for it."
532845, "You expect a rational calculation from me, but you speak like a mystic."
532846, "I doubt that, Judge. Forgive me, but I regret asking you this question already."
532847, "You are quite a pompous man, Judge. I don't have time for all this talk."
532849, "I see your point."
532850, "Rubin will come here tonight to get down to... examining my brother. You will get acquainted then."
532851, "All right."
532852, "Somewhere in Earth... 'Earth' is the name of the lowest part of the town, closest to the Abattoir. I haven't been there for several years... and I don't really know these slums all too well, especially since they were rebuilt after the fire. Victor has visited Isidor from time to time, so speak to him. He is in the wing next door."
532853, "Fine."
532854, "Don't worry, I'll take care of him myself, as soon as I'm done with the examination. My background has prepared me to wield a weapon better than I wield a scalpel."
532855, "Yet we have another concern at hand now. I'll check your drugstores; as for you, please follow your plan."
532856, "Call for me if you need me. I am staying at Eva Yan's place-it's close by."
532857, "Are you sure? Well, doesn't matter anyway... If it's that thing again... What do you think it is?"
532858, "Judging from what I've found so far, it could be Febris Typhoidea... or Plague."
532860, "I suspect Yersinia Pestis... or something not too dissimilar. What could these Steppes be home to?"
532861, "Hmm... You are unlikely to take them seriously. Let's call it 'folk medicine'. Herbs, eastern recipes, traditional steppe cures. But it works. Master used them during the First Outbreak and he survived, at least."
532862, "When was the first outbreak?"
532863, "Five years ago."
532864, "I see... Why are your drugstores in such an appalling state?"
532865, "Are they reliable?"
532866, "The ones made by Master were. It's a shame there're almost none left. The recipes... are unlikely to be found. I have a single extract left over from the old days; but we should try to find more."
532867, "Okay. Why are your drugstores in such an appalling state?"
532868, "They deliver medicine from the regional centre, but there hasn't been a regular train for quite some time. Do you know anything about this, by the way? Perhaps people have some medicine stored at home. But then, it's not like we can take it from them... and the stockpiles are empty."
532869, "Okay. We have another concern at hand now. I'll check your drugstores; as for you, please follow your plan."
532870, "I wish you the best of luck, dear colleague."
532871, "Do you think we're on the verge of an especially unhappy era?"
532872, "No grim events have clouded our existence since last summer. The country has cured its war wounds. Commercial communications have been repaired. Astrologists expect nothing ill. Do you hold astrologists' opinions in high regard?"
532874, "Why are you giving me that look? As if Simon's death was my fault!"
532875, "He's been murdered, yes. Looks like the murderer is always one step ahead of you, doesn't it? The same one that took Simon's life, too. At least, that's the conclusion suggested by the information at my disposal. Same pattern. Same signature."
532876, "So who did it?"
532877, "You wouldn't believe it: his own son. The fellow came back after being away for quite a while. His father had sent him to study surgery when he was but a greenhorn. Quite a lot he has learnt, huh? A wandering scholar turned evil to the bone! All of that just to grab the inheritance..."
532878, "Wait... How did you figure that out?"
532879, "In all honesty, it's hard to explain that to an outsider like you... do you believe in such a thing as clairvoyance, Bachelor?"
532880, "No."
532881, "Well, you should get to know my wife then. Or better yet, those who have already had opportunities to witness the power of her prophecies. Former doubters first and foremost. Rationalists. She's got something to say to you too, by the way..."
532882, "So your wife called out Isidor's son specifically?"
532883, "So you do have rationalists in the town? Except for me, that is..."
532884, "...Not specifically, no. But it all adds up. And the circumstances of Simon's death make you wonder, too. Isidor's son arrived here last night. The timing speaks against him. It even matches the time it takes to get from The Crucible to Isidor's house."
532885, "That's not enough. I'll have to take the investigation into my own hands. Is there anyone who can be of help to me... apart from your wife?"
532886, "What about the motive?"
532887, "He's the type that needs no motives. Students these days know nothing of virtue and ethics. And a medic, too... Humans are just hairless animals to them-or even a harmful virus infesting the environment. Cynical bastards! ...Oh, but I do apologize. Didn't mean to offend you, even by extension."
532888, "I see you like generalizations... I wouldn't be so quick to accuse the junior Burakh."
532889, "That's fine-especially since I agree. I'm fed up with students as well."
532890, "So you'll keep looking for Isidor's murderer?"
532891, "I will. Is there anyone that can help me with that?"
532892, "You seem to have found him already. Be my guest and tell Georgiy Kain the good news. I'm going back to the Capital."
532893, "An hour has passed. I can leave. The Executor is waiting outside."
532894, "Bachelor!/n/nA detachment of our volunteers were ambushed and massacred by a band of armed marauders. If you have any information at all with regard to the so-called 'barbers', I request that you pass it to me without further delay. It is imperative that we put an end to this criminal syndicate as soon as is possible./n/nI would also like to inform you that in order to fight the criminal spree of robbers and looters, I had no other choice but to withdraw significant numbers of patrolmen whose previous orders were to cordon off the infected districts./n/nAlexander"
532895, "Alexander Saburov's Invitation "
532896, "What a grotesque state of affairs. The buildings are not even remotely suitable for my purpose, but I hardly have any choice in the matter. If only by virtue of being spacious, the Theatre and the Cathedral will have to do. I need to conclude the inspection and take the keys to Vlad the Heavy."
532897, "The end is nigh? Why? "
532898, "The end is nigh... Only a miracle can save us... We have to hope for my girl. There's no other choice..."
532899, "'Dead Tissue'"
532900, "The Bachelor needs a sample of infected tissue. A specimen of infected blood may come in handy too."
532901, "*** The tissue was placed under the microscope. I wonder what kind of conclusions he will reach."
532902, "No. I've just finished distribuing the remaining weapons to patrolmen sent to the Bone Stake Lot. Rumour has it, something's brewing there... the rabble are trying to catch some maneater, all agog. But even if I had weapons, I wouldn't give any to you. Why in the world should I?"
532903, "Something's brewing? What exactly?"
532904, "Where can I get weapons around here?"
532905, "No one in the town owns real weapons. What little they have is old, refitted, makeshift-and mostly non-functional, too. I doubt anyone in the town would dare fire a shot without my permission. Nothing of the sort has happened in a few years."
532906, "Your effort is commendable."
532907, "So where did your men go?"
532908, "The Bone Stake Lot is located somewhere among the backalleys right in the middle of Earth. Between the Tanners and the Skinners districts. It used to be a huge dump... and before that the mob had used it for their barbaric gatherings. Some time ago they reclaimed the dump and revived the tradition."
532909, "Is this the best description you can offer? It won't be easy to find the place..."
532910, "You want to see the maneater too? Don't. Those are just dirty rumours, most likely... or you'll find some poor victim of a frenzied mob there. That's what the patrolmen are for. As for a better description, you can look for a huge upright boulder standing there since the beginning of time. A neolithic artifact."
532911, "What kind of dump?"
532912, "The dump's been there since the foundation of the Termitary. Then the construction of the Skinners and the Hindquarters began, and the waste was still dumped in the lot. People grumbled at first, but then they seemed to calm down... and now, recently, they just quietly cleaned it out."
532913, "Where did the waste go?"
532914, "No idea. It's like they ate it up. They couldn't have buried it, it's against their rules. They're protecting the earth, those savages... But where did my patrolmen disappear to?"
532915, "Should I maybe investigate it?"
532916, "Sounds intriguing... But I doubt I have any business there."
532917, "I see. My thanks to you."
532918, "I think I've seen it already."
532919, "Were there any traces?"
532920, "Look, I haven't been there myself. I'm quite content with interrogating suspects. Especially since we already know who we're after. You can join the hunt, by the way. I can describe his features."
532921, "Who is it then?"
532922, "There is absolutely no need! As of now, total impartiality is my motto."
532923, "Who are the people guarding Isidor's house?"
532924, "Those are volunteer patrolmen. We usually keep around twenty of them, but I've increased the number recently to a hundred and a half or so."
532925, "Really? Why do you need so many?"
532928, "There's unrest in the Termitary. If I weren't certain that Isidor's been murdered by his son, I would even consider the crime to be politically motivated. Isidor was preparing to take over the Kin and become its leader... at least according to the information I have."
532929, "Your wife again?"
532930, "No. The source is a bit more straightforward this time. And you really shouldn't look down on my wife's talents with such skepticism! Although you'll come around soon. Hopefully, your lack of faith won't end up being to costly for you... Time is running short."
532931, "...What are you talking about?"
532932, "Well, talk to her. The entrance to her chambers is on the other side of the house."
532933, "It will be an honour."
532934, "So what, did Isidor leave a fortune?"
532935, "Of course I do."
532936, "I have no idea yet. His belongings are being evaluated as we speak. It's not about money though... The Steppe people's idea of heirship still comes with those ancient connotations. Tribal ethics. The next of kin not only inherits things. They inherit knowledge. Fate. Power."
532937, "Such motive is incompatible with a student of medicine in my mind."
532938, "It's in their blood. Oh well... the outlaw will show his true colours soon enough when we catch him. He'll explain the motive himself."
532939, "How did you find him?"
532940, "What is this Yulia?"
532941, "She came here with an engineering team when the town was being rebuilt. Did logistics or maybe communications... not sure. They said she's a true expert in her field. Smart, yes. A polymath. Then the team left, but she stayed. She has my respect, but not my fondness."
532942, "Exactly the person I need."
532943, "No. If your description holds any merit, she's absolutely not what I'm looking for."
532944, "Oh, I see..."
532945, "I'd like to inquire about the fate of my colleague, Isidor Burakh. About the manner of his death, to be precise."
532946, "He will help me find Isidor Burakh's murderer."
532947, "Please kindly refrain from making me regret my previous kindness. Where does he live?"
532948, "Wait, what?! Isidor's been killed too? No, it can't be, unbelievable... Who is it walking through the town killing left and right? Oh, they'll come after me soon, too... Oh, please don't go, you hear me? Don't go, I need you to protect me!"
532949, "Your eyes... they've turned iron all of a sudden! Or is that irony? No, doesn't seem like it... Oh, I get it now... You're the harbinger that's been my very personal bogeyman all these years. You've been sent to me, haven't you?"
532950, "The sooner I speak to Vlad the Younger, the sooner I find the murderer. The sooner I reveal their identity, the sooner I'll put an end to them. Am I making myself clear?"
532951, "You won't tell Vlad I gave away his hideout, will you?"
532952, "No, Anna. I haven't."
532953, "Yes, you've exposed me. It's me. Speak up now."
532954, "Spill it-right now! I'm way more dangerous than the murderer."
532955, "No way! Not gonna tell you a thing now. Will probably live longer for that, too. If you try to hurt me, I'll scream. I'm a singer, and I have a deafening soprano! Don't you ever forget that! You know how loud I can scream? Like this: aaaaah..."
532956, "...Quiet, be quiet!"
532957, "A singer, huh... well, you sure as hell like acting up. I'd rather avoid you in the future."
532958, "No, I won't."
532959, "It depends on how the conversation goes."
532960, "...Really? Well, okay then. He's currently residing somewhere by the Station, doing some shady business in an abandoned shack. Is he, like, treasure-hunting...? I haven't been there, but I've heard that he bricked the windows in so that no one would peek... He's probably there right now."
532961, "I can take this from kids and weirdos, but you, a respectable negotiant..."
532962, "...It's hard for you to believe, isn't it? It used to be hard for many. Take my boy for example-a scoffer if I've ever seen one-and now even he believes it's real. He went off his head a bit... You're in the Steppe now, esteemed sir, Eastern and backwards. The dead rise from their graves here, clay dummies dance, and bulls talk..."
532963, "Right. A demon. Why didn't I think of it straight away? It was so obvious!"
532964, "No need to put on airs... Like you know life! Scarcely off the train and full of scorn already... Oh, I know these... big-city manners full well... Yet the Capital is a thousand versts away, as is any other decently civilized place... if you catch my drift. And you didn't let me finish..."
532965, "All right, I apologize for the sarcasm. Is your money where your mouth is though?"
532966, "So Simon was also killed by this... thing?"
532967, "And how do we catch this... creature? There must be a way, right?"
532968, "I have no idea. I'm not a Steppe man. These animals are only as interesting to me as they are... erm... productive. All is good as long as... the plow is pulled. As for how they're quacking among themselves... Who would seriously... take interest in that? Why was I cursed with a son like this...? Oh my sins, my grave sins..."
532969, "So your son bears little semblance to you?"
532970, "You don't seem to like the Steppe people..."
532971, "You call them rabble?"
532972, "So your son knows who the murderer is? Perhaps you've even giving shelter to them?"
532973, "And then nothing. There were little to no casualties among the children-we were in the Tower when it all began. But some kids just had to get out and make themselves busy with the whole outbreak business... invent shmowders, for example. And it worked. It all went on for several days-and then sort of withered all by itself. But the shmowders stayed."
532974, "And where are they?"
532975, "'Shmowders'? As in... 'powders'? What are you talking about?"
532976, "Oooh, powders! Powders-shmowders! Shmowders are sanative mixtures. They were invented during the First Outbreak. The original ones were made by Catchfly, but they were no good; the disease would pass, but the person would pass away along with it. But then Beaker's brothers made some nice ones. Crowfoot's weren't too shabby, and neither were Flanky's..."
532977, "Then stop ogling me like I'm an oddity too."
532978, "Who is Khan?"
532979, "Khan is our leader. He is the commander-in-chief and the steward of the Specular Tower."
532980, "The Specular Tower?"
532981, "I see."
532982, "The Polyhedron. The tower on the other side of the river. You won't be allowed in because you're not one of us."
532983, "I'm not too keen on getting in anyway..."
532984, "Too bad."
532985, "I'm dying to know how exactly these pharmaceutical prodigies were producing these things."
532986, "Well, you know... fiddled here, tampered there. Sniffed around for and obtained different drugs; ground them in a mortar, then mixed them together. But you can't just go ahead an do it, it requires a certain hunch. And even if the hunch was correct, shmowders are still always massively harmful, of course... but they make the disease leave the body. You end up poisoned but alive."
532987, "What disease?"
532988, "They mixed various drugs randomly and ingested the resulting substance? Little idiots..."
532989, "Every single shmowder that we know of had been stashed away in a safe place here, so that no one would poison themselves, but here we are-no shmowders..."
532990, "Maybe it's for the best."
532991, "Can I speak to the inventors of shmowders?"
532992, "Nope. Beaker's brothers have grown up and left. Catchfly and Crowfoot died during the tests-back then, I mean. This is why shmowders are so valuable! You can't reinvent them. You need to know the ingredients..."
532993, "Are there many left?"
532994, "How did it even cross your mind... to play epidemic!"
532995, "By accident. Why do you look so funny?"
532996, "Er... We're playing here. Rehearsing, actually... Also looking for something. We need it for the game. Nothing special, just some junk."
532997, "Well, the 'no children allowed' places are more fun anyway."
532998, "I don't understand a thing... How is it dangerous?"
532999, "The little ones are playing epidemic again. They wanted to get their hands on these damn shmowders so very much! So now we need to catch the kiddies-and I mean all the kiddies in the town, one by one-and pry the shmowders from their hands. See, the common opinion is that shmowders can cure all kinds of ailments and stuff, but in truth they're deadly!"
533000, "I am investigating the murder of Simon Kain. You will answer my questions. Question one: who are you?"
533001, "That doesn't sound too convincing. I am not a man to be trifled with, little scamp. I know everything."
533002, "...Yeah, well, it can't be fixed now anyway! All right, I'll tell you. Who knows-perhaps you'll even be of help. The kids are in danger. We've come here to get shmowders, but someone has already looted the cache. Maybe it was Capella's doing? She's probably distributed them among her minions, the pagan!"
533003, "Try again-and try to be honest this time."
533005, "Capella? Tell me about her."
533006, "Well.... Capella is Capella. Even though she's our foe, we still respect her. She's luring kids out of the tower, trying to organize a sect of some kind. And they worship her-like, for real. Well, that's understandable; she's the kind of girl that you could even fall in love with. Too bad she's not on our side! Of the river, that is. Pah, pride is the downfall of everyone."
533007, "So what you're saying is she's distributed the shmowders among the kids, right?"
533008, "She isn't much of a talker; people even used to think she was mute. But she's so kind, a true angel! Some people would gladly die to be taken care of by someone like her."
533009, "Is she underage or something?"
533010, "You have nothing to thank me for."
533011, "Really? Well, I'll have an opportunity to show you what my good graces mean! You won't regret it-and you'll see then that I never forget kindness."
533012, "You're too anxious. Do get some sleep."
533013, "Do you also think Simon Kain's death was unnatural?"
533014, "No, not at all... How could someone who had absorbed all our blood not die? A single man cannot handle that. There are limits to a living being's vitality... and there are limits to the world's patience."
533015, "So his death was inevitable, is that what you're saying?"
533016, "...Who is to blame for his death? Even if someone did have something to do with it, is that person worth blaming? Most likely, they didn't even realize they were killing someone... Yes, that is how it was. Now I see very clearly..."
533017, "Oh yeah, you're clairvoyant..."
533024, "Wait! What do you mean by the 'limits to a living being's vitality'? I think I've heard that somewhere before..."
533025, "Simon transformed our town into a single whole... a living being... He was the heart, and we were the blood running through the town's veins. We radiated his light, and that's why we used to shine so brightly. 'The Bound' are actually... bound to Simon..."
533026, "But who could have killed him?"
533027, "What about 'the limits to the world's patience'? What do you mean by that?"
533028, "I cannot elaborate upon this... I can only feel it. As if this was a heavenly wrath... the payback for all that he had done. The world couldn't stand it anymore."
533029, "But the world must have made someone its weapon, right?"
533030, "'Absorbed'? Simon used to drink human blood?"
533031, "Forgive me, but I must take my leave."
533032, "So you appreciated him as a fellow professional..."
533033, "Don't get smart with me, soldier. I can hold my own."
533034, "What makes you think the two cases are connected?"
533035, "Well, eh... Who would have the heart to attack such men? If you had asked me yesterday, I'd have told you no one would dare inflict such an ugly wound on this town. But if there is someone, it has to be just that: some ONE. Although it looks fishy, if you ask me... That thing was no man. That's what I think."
533036, "Explain yourself."
533037, "See, this murderous deal is all mysterious... There was a talon stuck in the victim's chest! Go ahead, bend your arm at the elbow, goodsir. Yeah, like that, there you go-that's how long it was. It broke off. There was dust on the floor, for the deceased had been a renowned Steppe-walker; and the dust was all covered in hoofsteps and, like, traces of a sharp bone, I guess? As if someone was using a walking stick 'round there. I'm telling you, it's her. The shabnak-adyr. The clay maneater."
533038, "I want to inspect the building."
533039, "We've been assigned to this post by Alexander, the head of the Saburov family. His house is in decline right now, but it's still powerful and very much respected-for it is they that's been responsible for maintaining wordly order and public safety in the town since olden days.

533040, "Who was killed?"
533041, "Well, you're not a local, sir, so you're unlikely to understand the loss we've suffered... Isidor Burakh. A great surgeon, a benefactor to us all, and an all-around skilled doc. An outstanding man, beloved and well-respected by us locals. Does it really always have to take the very best...? What a foul time to live in..."
533042, "I knew him. I'm a doctor too."
533043, "Whoever killed our only doc must surely be looking to get us all killed. Isidor could cure anything; he also knew how to make cuts, or incisions, 'cause he was a warden. He knew his lines all right. Like I said, it all makes sense. Whoever killed Simon, took Isidor's life too. And this is merely the beginning..."
533044, "My folks don't do no cuttin'. It's just for scares... A good old kick with a big blunt stick on someone's stubborn head-that's another thing entirely, that is. That's what you call tradition. But we don't do no cuttin'-the scares would be on us... It's forbidden, cuttin' is. But these cunts would stop at nothin'...

533097, "When was it?"
533098, "I attended your lecture-you demonstrated a reanimated lady. Three years ago at Lamarka's. I even took your autograph-the girl in a long shirt, do you remember? I asked you about the glassy lips too."
533099, "Oh... that's some twist of fate. I am very happy to make your acquantaince too, Aglaya. However, back then you introduced yourself as..."
533100, "Stella, Stella Karstlich. To be frank, I came by out of sheer curiosity. I had neither a mission nor any mercenary interests... But you did make a strong impression on me..."
533101, "Thank you... But it isn't sheer curiousity that has driven you here, is it?"
533102, "No, I don't seem to remember. Did that really happen?"
533103, "Let's get to the point. You wanted to hear my report, didn't you?"
533104, "...Indeed, let's get to the point. Your mission was to find a certain way to destroy the enemy completely. All I had to do was implement your solution. So I've looked through your reports-and they've confirmed my greatest fear."
533105, "Yes. I've lost."
533106, "You've won. Almost. I'm very happy that you didn't find the disease carrier yesterday."
533107, "Is that so?"
533108, "Events have taken an unexpected turn, Dankovsky. We have a lot to discuss and a lot to do. I'll be brief. All this time someone has been trying to a) kill you, b) deceive you. And c) use your authority and passion for the truth to achieve criminal goals. Would you like to know more?"
533109, "Very much so."
533110, "You came here on your own accord, didn't you? Thanatica is in ruins. Your last hope was to draw publicity, to get a sensation. Find something shocking. An ostensive proof of your theory. Correct me if I'm wrong, this is all just my interpretation..."
533111, "You are correct so far."
533112, "Then you come across this-allegedly coincidental-letter from Isidor Burakh; and here you are. So timely! Isn't it? And, as luck would have it, the only local medic dies. He didn't die of the disease, did he? That's what I've been told. He was murdered. But luck is on the side of the public! You are in this remote area, and so you are ordered to come back with the shield, so to speak. Victory is the only option that's been left for you."
533113, "Was that contrived too?"
533114, "I don't know. I am sure I have a lot more interesting details to find out. Will you help me?"
533115, "Of course!"
533116, "Here is where my own curiosuty chimes in. Who are you loyal to?"
533117, "Oh, you'll find that out soon enough! Just let me compile some kind of image of you in my head. Okay?"
533118, "You've given yourself away already."
533119, "I haven't. It can all be a trap, a double play. We inquisitors are quite cunning, you ought to know that. Relax. Everything I told could turn out to be nothing more that a part of my plan, a provocation. What if in fact I'm loyal to the Powers That Be? Hmm?"
533120, "Why are you asking me?"
533121, "I'm not... It's just my way of coping with grief. I need a smoke so badly..."
533122, "Put me to the test."
533123, "Yes, you're a dangerous partner indeed."
533124, "That is my duty."
533125, "Wait! I've found the carrier! It's a woman."
533126, "Really? I can't believe my ears... And who is it?"
533127, "A mysterious girl named Clara. I know neither who she is nor where she came from."
533128, "I've heard about the girl. Allegedly, she is deranged. A saint to some, a most dangerous killer to others. She is a very interesting character, and I'm planning to go see her today. Do you have proof?"
533129, "Interrogate her. You'll see for yourself."
533130, "It's Lara Ravel, a daughter of a war hero. The owner of the tiny Shelter."
533131, "I'll get to know her as soon as possible. Why do you think it's her?"
533132, "Among the factual materials that you can find attached to my report there is a peculiar blood specimen. That isn't human blood. It's the blood of a creature whose organism the bacteria can inhabit without posing any threat to the creature's life. This lady's blood is... very similar to the specimen."
533133, "What do you mean 'similar'? It it inhuman?"
533134, "I can't say for sure. I had no special equipment."
533135, "I'll check your data. However, I am absolutely positive that there is not and could not be a human carrier of the disease."
533136, "The recessive nature of the disease means that there is someone spreading it. The facts are glaring."
533137, "Elaborate on that please. By 'recessive nature' you mean that the disease is prone to retreating and then coming back again?"
533138, "Indeed. Even though the bacteria dies rapidly, and we took every possible quarantine measure. Very few people were allowed outside."
533139, "I doubt that is due to a person."
533140, "What then?"
533141, "The locals call her Aspity."
533142, "It's Yulia Lyuricheva. She leads a rather solitary life."
533143, "It's the girl that goes by the name of Eva Yan. I'm currently staying at her house."
533144, "No wonder. The world is falling to pieces before our very eyes."
533145, "I have the raiment. The lining is thick enough to keep a soul locked-in. I see now why the Executors chose this as a suitable outfit for their job."
533146, "I've talked to her already. She seems to be a little... out of it."
533147, "What is the Kin?"
533148, "The Steppe people who work in the Abattoir, many of the factory workmen... An ignorant patriarchal pile that hasn't changed much since the Stone Age. They look human enough, but if you look closer... they're just beasts. Believe me when I'm telling you that I am not snobbish in the slightest, but... there's good reason to call them that."
533149, "Yes, Isidor has always had the air of a person untouched by civilization..."
533150, "I see."
533151, "Goodness! Isidor was an educated, modern man compared to them. They revered him, too. He got to know modern knowledge, but never left his people... A complicated man, may he rest in peace..."
533152, "Yes... I'm sorry about Isidor."
533153, "I don't like all this..."
533154, "How do you know all this?"
533155, "Was Simon this kind of person?"
533156, "Yes. Beyond a shadow of doubt, he was."
533157, "I see."
533158, "Why?"
533159, "People like these are a natural hazard. Their mission exists as long as they believe in it, and others suffer from its consequences."
533160, "I agree."
533161, "Aren't you sorry about his death?"
533162, "You managed to find out so much about me in one minute's talk..."
533163, "I doubt I can do it on my own. Tell me plain and simple; what do you make of all this?"
533164, "So I have heard. A wisecrack I know says that while you are trying to complete the portrait of the killer, the killer is busy painting yours. Hilarious, is it not? The hunter becomes the hunted... However, to put it bluntly you have become the keynote of this particular plot. The intrigue is so rich it will keep you busy for a week-if not longer than that."
533165, "Oh really! And you are singing the same tune too? First they flaunt some clairvoyants before me..."
533166, "Oh? I take it you've met Katerina already? I urge you to take her prophecies seriously. You see, as dubious a factor as any prophecy is, Katerina's were always frightfully spot-on. Which means we should not arbitrarily disregard them... if nothing else."
533167, "I am used to paying attention to honest people with a sceptical mind. Let us change the subject."
533168, "If you want my advice, I wouldn't trust what our feudals tell you. The perpetual triangle of influence means that every party concerned will do their best to use your authority to their own benefit."
533169, "What would you do if you were me?"
533170, "I'm not that conceited. Perhaps people of lower standing would not try to use me?"
533171, "It is more likely that people of such standing will be much too scared to cooperate. Given your position, you may want to try your luck with the shadow cabinet of local nobility; the women of influence. They know much more than the simple townsfolk, yet they care much less than the families in power."
533172, "My position?"
533173, "You came from the Capital, and your arrival hardly qualifies as a coincidence. Then there is this trepidation Maria seems to have towards you; she who excels in dark arts and scornful mockery. Her interest has furnished you with a certain elusive notoriety. Some people thought you were nothing more than Maria's private incubus; a fruit of her imagination. And then-here you are, in the flesh."
533174, "Who are these lady aristocrats?"
533175, "Lady aristocrats... Such way of saying it will be of relevance strictly within the specific context of values and perceptions characteristic of a backwoods hole like ours. The catch is that the aristocracy is not defined by birthright here. Rather the status is granted by the degree of enigmatic fascination that a woman is possessed of. Questionable background. Audacity of demeanour. You know... this whole assortment."
533176, "Do tell me who these affluent ladies are."
533177, "Lara. Eva. Yours truly. And last, but not least-Maria. I wouldn't listen to Katerina if I were you, her morphine habit has turned her into a walking corpse. The others, however, are liable to deceive. You don't like being lied to, do you?"
533180, "Could you tell me about Lara?"
533184, "I'd rather not speak on the matter. You will know Lara well enough as soon as you meet her. My relationship with her is... complicated."
533186, "I can't stand it. It is better to die than to lie."
533187, "I see. Perhaps you like being played with, then?"
533188, "Even less so."
533189, "In this case Maria seems to be your best bet. She is too arrogant to lie, and too respectful to dare play with you. You should value the affection of someone this proud... But I digress. What is your intended course of action?"
533190, "It depends. It seems the Kains have been so considerate as to promote me to the rank of bait. There is no need for any special efforts to play that role; the main thing is to be available."
533191, "I need to think, if you please. I will ask more questions if something else crosses my mind; especially since you are one of the lady aristocrats."
533194, "In this case I would suggest that Simon was poisoned. By the Kains, I would have thought, but I know their family all too well. Their mutual loyalty is only rivalled by their arrogance towards anyone who is not one of them. They hold the princely sage who stands at the head of their family in highest esteem. They believe that a single dishonourable act will tarnish their name for generations to come... I doubt any of them would have stooped to this. No matter whether they wanted to or not."

533209, "Аh... You've come at last! Thanks-but evidently it has all been pointless. I'm an idiot. "
533211, "Actually, she is... was. She was free to choose her own life and do as she pleased, but she was my woman. You have nothing to be distressed about; your woman is Maria. I would have gladly switched places with you, but she obviously would never see an equal in me... and it's irrelevant now anyway."
533212, "So what happened to Eva? "
533213, "What do you mean? Eva jumped from the balustrade of the Cathedral. That's the kind of a Cathedral we have now-consecrated by suicide! But poor Eva thought otherwise... She wanted to become the Soul of the Cathedral. She never knew that the stupid construction was not intended to be a Focus! "
533214, "But others are?"
533215, "Erecting a construction that can hold a soul is not humanly possible. We've only managed to do it once-just recently; but that's another story. You'll come to know everything in due time. As for our Cathedral, it's cursed. The whole town is-since today."
533216, "She wrote a letter to me too. Said she was going to purify the place for the new guest. That means the place is the Cathedral and the guest is Aglaya, right? "
533218, "You are probably right. Let's go."
533219, "Somehow this death has impacted me more than the thousands upon thousands of other deaths that have occurred here recently..."

533229, "Now it's my turn to ask you a favour. It feels strange to admit that, but I actually can't achieve one of my most coveted goals in this town. Only you can help me. I have learned that Victor Kain's aloof daughter is madly in love with a certain proud fighter of death."
533230, "She is? That's news to me. At least, nothing in her behavior betrays that."
533231, "Perhaps. But my request is very important. In fact, the fate of this town may depend on it. Please, arrange for me to meet with my beloved relative. She won't refuse you."
533232, "Very well. That won't be hard. But only if she really is happy to see you."
533236, "Whatever happens to me now, do not be surprised by anything. Just promise that you will never doubt me... "
533237, "Turns out that Aglaya Lilich is your relative? I didn't know that. "
533238, "Yes. She is the younger sister of my lovely mother. And there is not a single person in the world who would hate my mother more viciously than she does. "
533239, "She claims to be fond of you."
533240, "I saw Aglaya tonight! At dawn, just before she arrived! I sat here, trying to think about... about my lovely mother. Suddenly it was as if something had touched me, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I rushed to the window-and there I saw her!"
533241, "What did she do? "
533242, "Pale as death, she stood by the window, pressing her palm against the pane. And her face touched the glass too, ever so slightly-only the tip of her nose... She looked straight at me, unblinking. She could not enter. But she wanted to so very much... "
533243, "You're forcing my hand. I'll cure you of these whims."
533244, "Why would I doubt you?"
533245, "A memory of a person grants them an immortality of its own kind. Yet how soon have people forgotten Simon! He's fading away with every minute that goes by..."
533246, "Your daughter intends to go out into the town. Are you aware of her plans?"
533247, "I don't need to, doctor. I can just look out of my window-or at you, for that matter."
533249, "What's her business in town?"
533250, "I think she was going to see the architects. Andrey or Peter. Peter, most likely. She needed to know something about the Tower. About the inner workings of some chambers, I believe. She's particularly concerned about it now... because of Simon's memory fading."
533251, "Speaking of Aglaya Lilich, she's been seeking an audience with Maria."
533252, "I don't think any good will come of that... Aglaya has always been a mean little girl... But you know, I've always believed that people can and do change for the better. Every time an enemy of mine returned after a prolonged absence, I welcomed them with open arms."
533253, "You are a generous person, Victor... And... a bit of a dreamer. Pardon my lack of ceremony."
533254, "Maria is planning to visit Peter Stamatin-the one whose life you saved. If you wish to see your niece, you'd better hurry."
533255, "I can't appreciate your help enough, Bachelor... I won't forget your service!"
533256, "I'll come by to see your tearful reconciliation."
533257, ""
533258, "It's horrible... The game has been spoiled. The future is falling apart before my very eyes. For the first time ever I'm feeling helpless..."
533259, "Don't be afraid, Maria. I'm at your side."
533260, "I will never forgive you for that! You brought her here!"
533261, "You shouldn't have lied to me, Maria."
533262, "Oh how naïve you were... Did you really trust her? Tell me, did she hypnotize you? Can simple trickery like that really get to you? You could have ruined us all-or maybe you have... Peter is out cold now, but what if he comes to?"
533263, "Did she interrogate him? "
533264, "How are you? Have you come to? Tell me what happened."
533265, "I had a vision, old boy. When I learned about Saburov's secret plan and realized that death was truly knocking on my door, I had a sudden urge to quench my thirst once and for all-so that I wouldn't have to come to my senses until my very death."
533266, "Peter, Peter! Come round, what's wrong with you? Damn it, he's delirious..."
533267, ""
533268, "I was just helping the owner come to. He's been telling quite compelling stories!"
533269, "I need a new weapon. This revolver doesn't have enough firepower."
533270, "White vaccine. I wrote about it in the reports. Two doses, preferrably. I've been told you confiscated several today."
533271, "Some potent antibiotics. I have sick people under my care. I need to talk with them."
533272, "Nothing, just leave now. I'm already starting to regret this."
533273, "...Was all this really calculated and built by a man? This miserable, drunk, vulnerable creature..."
533274, "Don't say so! That man is my friend."
533275, "'The Family Meeting'"
533276, "So the elder girl did something that scared the younger and then grew up to become an Inquisitor? No wonder the younger girl misunderstood the situation. But now, the prejudice Maria Kaina seems to have against Aglaya Lilich may have a bearing on the town politics. I have to try, though. Blessed are the peacemakers."
533277, "What is on Maria's mind? Where did she go, in disregard of all my prohibitions? It appears she was careless enough to let her father in on her plan, and that he told her to forget about it at once."
533278, "Is today the last chance for the father to see his beloved daughter? Could it be that the most reasonable of the town rulers is drifting towards expiration? Doesn't look like it. Rather, it seems quite the opposite. But then, what did he mean? And Maria, what would she possibly want with Peter Stamatin?"
533279, "*** Hmm... It seems that setting up this meeting was not such a good idea. But why did Aglaya say that the fate of the settlement depends on what she and Maria will have to tell each other? Apparently, this situation is less of a family affair than it first appeared..."
533280, "I think I should pay a visit to Peter. After all, Maria deserves to know the real reason of this incidental family meeting. It would also be interesting to learn the result of it. I feel I will have to spend a hefty measure of smelling salts to find out."
533285, "We children are funny creatures: half human, half something else. Our inner world is off limits to the adults. You can't see our real faces just as you can't touch our dreams. Which is why we need these scary heads. See how it all works?"
533286, "I see that you are here-and have no idea why that is."
533287, "Is this your idea of a joke, smartypants?"
533288, "Me, smartypants? No way. Your pants are much smarter than mine. My head's been lost in the Tower; I don't need it here."
533289, "The Polyhedron?"
533290, "The Specular Tower on the other side of the river. There is no death, no grief, no boredom, and no disease there. That is proven for certain. Only dumbheads leave it voluntarily, if you ask me. You have to be an absolutely thick and heartless creature lacking any semblance of imagination to refuse something of the sort."
533291, "Oh... You mean that odd structure next to the Crucible? Please don't tell me someone's living in there..."
533292, "That's some story embroidering, mate."
533293, "What Tower?"
533294, "What are you doing here walking around headless then?"
533295, "Hmm... Why were they produced in the first place then?"
533296, "An adult will be severely poisoned-they'll be bedridden for a week or so... and that's it. But it spells doom for little kids!"
533297, "Explain yourself."
533298, "How are we supposed to find the shmowders now? Do we seriously need to detain every little kid in the street? What do we barter with them for? And we can't take the shmowders by force. Bullying is against the rules-Khan would totally bite our heads off for that."
533299, "What's wrong with your head?"
533300, "It's personal protective equipment! It reflects valuable thoughts back into my skull so that I don't lose them along the way. Scares people away quite nicely too. We aren't just hanging here, you know, we're on a combat mission. Well, we were-and then we totally blew it..."
533301, "Really? How so?"
533302, "Strange guests are walking all around your house. I am uneasy around them. Please come back soon!/n/nAyan"
533303, "Note from Ayan "
533304, "Ayan"

533306, ""
533308, "The Tower? Magical? Sounds fishy. I think it demands a thorough inspection..."
533309, "Please don't, Khan wouldn't let you in. You're contagious."
533310, "How are you lot going to return then?"
533311, "We're not... we're an operational squad. Tomorrow we'll be sent on a very important mission to deal with the oppressors that are trying to exterminate us. And, well, tough luck for us. The Tower is only impregnable for the infection from the outside. That's just how it works. The mechanics of it."
533312, "All right. I'll talk to Capella."
533313, "What a lovely lady! She welcomed us, she talked to us! Children are not allowed to be in contact with the Kin people, you know... Forbidden fruit and all that. It is the sweetest one."
533315, "They say, young lady, that you are somewhat sceptical towards the peculiar qualities of this... Polyhedron?"
533316, "I don't know... You are brave, and my duty dictates caution. It's getting more and more frightening by the minute. The reckoning is yet to come... if it hasn't already. The Tower defies the very nature of miracles, you see. It imprisons them. That's why the wisest children have already left it."
533317, "How curious... Which ones? Apart from you, that is."
533318, "Taya Tycheek, for instance. A five-year-old kid worshipped by the Kin. They call her the Mother Superior. She was merely a careless kidling in the Tower, and now she is in charge of the Termitary and the five thousand souls inside. Have you been there already, by the way? I'm worried about her..."
533319, "All right."
533320, "Capella asked me to give the medicine to warden Tycheek's little daughter, this extraordinary child whom the 'beastly crowd of primates' obey and serve as they would serve a little goddess. Apparently the children's mysterious influence in the town extends much further than the Kain family."
533321, "The emissaries from the Tower request that I leave the Tower and its residents alone. As if I was pestering them all this while! They say that everything is perfectly well inside the Tower and that Olgimsky's daughter will confirm it. This serves more to increase my suspicions than curb them. Only yesterday the same kind of assurances were offered with regard to the Termitary. I need to speak with Capella."
533322, "Take this news as a matter of urgency and importance, Bachelor./n/nSome inconceivable filth appears to be seeping from within the Termitary. Your good name and even your academic reputation may come under fire because of it. You've planned to visit that house of woe, as far as I know. Please oblige me with a little chat beforehand./n/nWith all due respect,/nVlad Olgimsky, the Younger"
533323, "Vlad the Younger's Letter "
533324, "Right, you undoubtedly have a lot of questions in mind, but they'll have to wait. Except for one... the most pressing-and, dare I say, painful-concern. We've lost enough time as it is. The crud's not going to wait... is it? And your visit to the Termitary... all in all, there's no point in putting it off."
533325, "I'll find the lowlifes. And then I'll return to you and we're going to have a long and unpleasant conversation."
533327, ""
533328, "Peace to you, oynon, peace to you. Live and let live-so say the wise..."
533329, "Here you are, you can of worms... So, can I place an order?"
533330, "We're guilty-the boös's son is twice as guilty. We just fool around and mess about. He-he's buying up the real panacea! Bought it from everyone who got one from Burakh, took from everyone, has it for himself! Shoot him, oynon, threaten him, rob him-take his panacea for yourself, thank us... "
533331, "Where did he get real panacea?"
533332, "On your knees now, paws on the ground! Face down!"
533333, "Only Burakh can make panacea, only Burakh knows the lines. Burakh gave his vials to Boddho's children, gave to the boös-the boös's son took it all to sell to evil people, to bloodsuckers, for iron and gold. Have mercy on us, oynon... Let us go, never again... until the earth takes us back..."
533334, "No. You'll see no mercy from me. You're worse than murderers."
533335, "Fine... I'll tell the Mother about this room, though. You have half an hour to get lost for good!"
533336, "Don't try to sweet-talk me, morlock!"
533337, "Well... I've found the Worm poison-makers. But they told me that you, master Vlad, have also dabbled in the panacea black market!"
533338, "I promised to keep their names secret. I'm wary of Clara, you see. She's very good at getting what she needs from people... both words and things. Well, one of them is Mark Immortell. He's not hiding it, but his situation is different-he's running a plague house after all..."
533339, "You've given me serious food for thought. Thank you."
533340, ""
533341, "See who my audience is now... They rarely applaud, they never call encore-but they also never boo us. And, as you can see, we have a full house every night..."
533342, "Tell me, has Olgimsky the Younger really sold you several vials of panacea?"
533343, "He didn't even sell them, he gave them to me basically for free-or maybe for a token payment. You know... I never expected something like this from him. I would suspect an intricate and crafty scheme on his part, but I think I have also changed... so I believe him."
533344, "I see. Thank you, Mark. "
533345, "And you must be blaming me for that... reasonably so."
533346, ""
533347, "...Tomorrow this place will be crawling with soldiers! Oh, what will become of us... And every new rumour I hear contradicts the previous one!"
533348, "Lara, is it true that Vlad the Younger has sold you a panacea?"
533349, "...No, it's not. Oh, why do you even have to ask... are you all trying to torture me on purpose?"
533350, "But you're still a lousy liar. Are you oathbound?"
533351, "I am. Forgive me."
533352, "It's fine. I know what happened anyway."
533353, "Nothing special is about to happen. Soldiers are very predictable-they're the same wherever you go."
533354, ""
533355, "I had a feeling you were about to pay me a visit... That's the trip wires of fate for you. Sorry if it sounded a bit too assertive."
533356, "Tell me, Yulia; is it true that Vlad Olgimsky gave you a vial of panacea?"
533357, "So this is the panacea after all? Incredible..."
533358, "Didn't you know?"
533359, "He told me that Burakh has managed to compound a cure. He said that I should drink the contents of the vial if I started to feel unwell. It is interesting to note that he warned me, quite deliberately, against telling Clara about it. I gave him a nod of absent-minded consent and what do you know... the very next moment Clara was at my doorstep."
533360, "And who else did Vlad the Younger offer panacea to?"
533361, "Don't worry about that."
533362, "'Panacea Black Market'"
533363, "Yet again they substitute a useless fake for the precious solution that many would describe as the epitome of life itself! There is a group of Worms in the Termitary, who brew some atrocious swill that they peddle for outrageous prices. All under the cover of Isidor Burakh's name. Just wait till I get to them..."
533364, "Well would you look at that... Vlad the Younger has entered the panacea market! The man won't let a single penny past his purse! It occurs to me that he is no better than Bad Grief. I need to find out how he set up his trade. Could be the Worms trying to frame him for their own profiteering."
533365, "Yes, people do change a lot. Before, I was convinced that this man was beyond salvation. I thought that nothing less than death could make the leopard change its spots. But I see a new man before me now. His former self has died; but not before he gave the entirety of his panacea stock to Mark Immortell."
533366, "*** What is going on? Are they playing tricks on me again? It shouldn't be hard to tell... Mark gave the panacea to 'those whose lives are in most immediate peril'; namely to Lara, Yulia, and some individual who 'expressed a desire to remain incognito'. Honestly, she didn't have to take the trouble, this 'individual'."
533367, "*** I did not manage to expose the panacea black market. I could not trace the genuine flasks of the cure either."
533368, "I have to go, Eva. Tell me where Simon Kain lives."
533369, "What kind of game is that?"
533370, "Well... A stupid kind, to be honest. Sort of doctors and hospitals and stuff... don't you know how preschoolers play?"
533371, "All right. So what about the... shmowders?"
533372, "I've come to miss the days when I used to play such games..."
533373, "I am certainly no better investigator than you. I never had a chance to search for a murderer before... The best I can offer is to fill in the blanks with whatever mysterious supernatural entities seem most fitting. Shabnak-adyr is the simple man's scarecrow. I would have followed a different narrative. "
533374, "What kind of narrative? Consider the circumstances of his death. They said Simon had locked himself up in the evening and consequently died in the morning inside the mansion, in a chamber with some peculiar name."
533375, "Do you like Eva Yan?"
533376, "Very much. It wouldn't be much of a stretch to say I absolutely admire her."
533377, "Weird. I expected you to have a different opinion of her."
533378, "She dons the mask of absent-minded promiscuity. But this pose has nothing to do with what she really is. I'd be happy to be friends with her. But she does not understand me-and rightfully so, considering her eminence."
533379, "I can't believe my ears."
533380, "Sooner or later, a fervent believer may emerge from within her, dissolving her completely in the object of her adoration. After which she will probably kill herself. But I'd rather talk no more of that."
533381, "All right."
533382, "Why is that?"
533383, "They say that Lara is an angel; an epitome of benevolence and compassion. She sees everyone as a friend. She is too eager to help; too happy to oblige... After her father died, she turned the Ravel mansion into the most hospitable and heartwarming place in town. Long story short, Lara is believed to be the kindest woman of us all. However..."
533384, "That's not true?"
533385, "She is a woman devastated by grief. All the gifts that she is so happy to give away are, fundamentally, offerings to a dead person. She favours the living with something the dead have no use for. "
533386, "Really?"
533387, "Her philantropy is almost reprehensible. She pities everyone she comes across, for she knows they will all die just like her dearly departed. She sees a corpse in everyone she looks upon. I can't say I appreciate it. But that being said, she will certainly be of great help to you and your enquiry."
533388, "I see."
533391, "Who is the addressee?"
533392, "Could it be her late father? This is merely a speculation though, something I was able to conjecture from what observations I made."
533393, "So Lara is no angel?"
533394, "I struggle to imagine a person whose name is less reflective of her inner self."
533395, "An unforgiving description."
533396, "Unforgiving, but fair. Anna affects to be suffering, but her hypocrisy is all too easy to see through. If she was genuinely wanted-for the February Riots, or for the Caravan-she would have been found years ago. She manages to trick her destiny for now, but her luck will run dry soon enough."
533397, "How is she cheating fate?"
533399, "What? What caravan?"
533400, "The Ace of Diamonds Caravan. It left a ghastly imprint on her, the way it did with everything it came close to. Still, I am not entirely positive whether Anna has travelled with the caravan or not. She is a singer, allegedly, and the caravan comprised entertainers of different persuasion. But is she really an actress? This remains to be seen. What seems peculiar is how artificial, and how contrived this dark secret appears to be. As if it were a disguise."
533401, "What could she be afraid of?"
533405, "Poisoned? How did you arrive at this conclusion?"
533406, "I don't believe you understand what 'he died in Focus' really implies. Do you know what the Kains refer to as 'Focus'? You don't seem to grasp the semantics of the term. These are the Kains for you; these kinds of innuendos are their forte."
533408, "What's that word... the one you've just said?"
533409, "Shabnak-adyr, you mean? The Steppe demonology describes it as a kind of golem; belched up by the Earth to punish all manner of delinquency. It is shaped as a young woman, but made of clay and exhumed bone matter. An unnerving concept, is it not?"
533410, "I've always suspected that primitive worldviews still exist in the remote corners of our country, but I couldn't imagine they would be so active..."
533411, "I knew you would be exasperated by this discussion. Sacrifices... bovine tails... handfuls of milk-teeth in a glass beaker. You may forgive this to children and Steppe people, yet having the same notions reiterated by someone surrounded by books on natural history? This must be quite vexing."
533412, "How would you explain this?"
533413, "The answer is bound to irritate you even more. The tales are true."
533414, "Bah! You are joking, of course?"
533415, "I do hyperbolise a little. It is beyond debate that Shabnak-adyr exists. What is dubious though is that bovine tails and milk-teeth offer genuine protection from her. Which is to say, sympathetic contrivances like this may be of some use to children and people from the Steppe, but are explicitly inefficacious for someone like you and me. We are too literate, too deprived of the scripture codified in ancient soil."
533416, "So? Am I supposed to write off a bad harvest as a sign that the Steppe spirits are angry now?"
533417, "We have no choice but to acknowledge the rules enforced by the Steppe. We tried to ignore these rules; to place ourselves into the framework of advanced modernity... to no avail. You can call these demons what you want... you may refer to the Hair Eater as 'time' if this will make you any happier. I am comfortable with a more juvenile vernacular. It is what I am used to."
533418, "I will find a rational explanation for the crimes of this maneater by the evening. If you help me, of course..."
533419, "So you believe all that yourself, too?"
533422, "Things like this can drive you mental-especially with a backdrop of primitive relics..."
533423, "The world is defined by a plethora of causal relationships. These causalities, however, are located at different tiers of human perception. There is a tier where people may change them instictively-due to their inane propensity for acting in a reasonable, egocentric manner-and the scale of this tier is negligibly insignificant. In layman's terms, catching a glass before it touches the floor does not mean the glass wouldn't break within next few minutes. "
533424, "Elaborate on that please. I don't understand."
533425, "Take my own death, for instance. It depends on a myriad of contingent coincidences. In our town, such coincidences have put together several women whose inexplicable aptitude allows them to see the whole chain of cause-effect connections. They also see where the chain would lead; which is to my death. How's that for an example?"
533426, "But what about free will? Can't the people that can affect this tragic event change the course of causes and consequences?"
533427, "If a Mistress were to intuit that there is no man or woman capable of breaking-or mending-these kinds of connections, she would not hesitate to reveal the future. Her account would be exhaustive at times, but it is more likely to be somewhat vague... This is merely speculation, though. I won't be surprised if reality proves to be much more terrifying than that."
533428, "Terrifying? What do you mean?"
533429, "I'd rather not entertain the thought. The world is so small, perhaps, and we have so little time left, that all that lies ahead may be foreseen in the most minute detail. Someone may be sitting somewhere this very moment-and seeing everything that we are doomed to suffer."
533430, "No, I don't want to believe this."
533431, "Tell me, Yulia, are there people that I can talk to directly, without revelations or allegories, in town?"
533432, "Who are these women?"
533433, "We refer to them as Mistresses. The first two were smart enough not to squander their gift with marketplace tomfoolery. Regrettably, both are dead. The third is still alive. There are also a few aspirants that try to interpret the words of the Mistresses, or regurgitate them within their own prophecies. It is all child's play though."
533434, "How could they predict fortunes?"
533435, "Well, I didn't let the glass break, did I? Or is it a connection I've changed instinctively?"
533437, "A curious conclusion, but an incorrect one. Simon was disfigured and bleeding. His bones were broken."
533438, "All right. Let me suggest, then, that while he was in the Steppe, he saw or learned something that he wanted to report to all three ruling families. In this case, either of the Olgimsky family should have been on his itinerary-especially since Burakh was one of their own men."
533439, "But did they? Want to do it, I mean?"
533440, "In all likelihood, they did. Their respect for Simon was nothing compared to the adoration felt by the common townspeople. After all, every Kain suffers the same kind of benign insanity that leads to people pursuing their own fantasies-and little else other than that. This indulgence is something that Simon would likely stand in the way of."
533441, "So you think the cause of death is poison?"
533442, "Well, what is this 'Focus' then?"
533443, "The Focus is anything but an abstraction. Quite the opposite in fact, it is governed by mathematically rigid regularities. You see, no one but the owner of a Focus may get inside. This can only mean that Simon had brought the killer with him. Or rather-within him, since no physical object may be brought into Focus either."
533444, "How do you know that?"
533445, "Who doesn't? The Kains are notoriously passionate about all manner of synthetic anomalies. They will never pass up the opportunity to devise a kunststück that would allow them to warp space, challenge physics, or manipulate optics... Metaphysically, a Focus can be compared to a camera obscura; do note that the name is not unfitting. No. It is entirely impossible for someone to get inside."
533446, "And you're also not allowed to eat or drink... But that makes one suspect foul play in regard to Isidor's death. He had been stabbed, after all."
533447, "'Stabbed' does not even begin to describe it. Stakh Rubin told Lara that Isidor was slaughtered by some object resemblant of a humongous, razor sharp talon. What a riveting case... No wonder some people will start talking of Steppe monsters made of assorted bones."
533448, "What? A claw-like object?"
533449, "Such was the 'topography of the wound'-according to Rubin. Neither Lara nor me are quite able to colloquialize a term like this... You should speak with him directly if you wish to know the details. Make haste if you want to get ahold of him; Rubin is eager to join Simon as soon as possible... no pun intended."
533450, "Yes... Let's get back to the subject of Isidor's murder."
533452, "As you wish."
533453, "Yeah, same here."
533454, "Oh good heavens! To think this woman has been introduced to me as a sceptic and an analyst!"
533455, "...All right then. Who are these influential ladies?"
533456, "Can't say I care all that much. I can live with it."
533457, "So there's a bloodied man hiding in her house. Where would that be?"
533458, "Mysteriously?"
533459, "They all died of natural causes, allegedly; even though Willow was buried in a tightly closed coffin. The body was examined by Isidor Burakh, however, and he is not a man who would cover up a crime. Anyway, you would do good to take a look at the house yourself. The mansion is known as the Willows, it stands by the Gullet, in Earth."
533460, "For crying out loud, Yulia... You are a mystic. Saburov is mocking me!"
533461, "You are repeating something that Isidor had once told me, almost word for word... By the way, I find his murder far more infuriating than Simon's!"
533462, "Is that so? Well, this does introduce a different perspective... Did you say Isidor was the last person to see Simon? The question is, who did he see before? The sun had not yet set when Isidor returned from the Steppe. However, he came to Simon well after midnight. The question naturally arises; where did he spend the missing few hours?"
533463, "That is why I'm trying to trace Isidor's steps. I want to walk the same route; don't get me wrong though..."
533464, "Was Isidor seen with Saburov, by any chance?"
533465, "He was. He warned Saburov of an upcoming storm."
533466, "Where is Rubin at the moment?"
533467, "Mourning his master, I think. They were very close. Did you investigate Isidor's house yet?"
533468, "Yes, but they won't let anyone in there."
533469, "How do you know all that?"
533470, "I think you still fail to grasp the entirety of your predicament. The rumours spread like wildfire here. One of the children saw Isidor come home. They were waiting by the entrance, eager to hear a Steppe story or two."
533471, "So the prosecution of Isidor's son is based on the testimony of a child? That is what Saburov claims."
533472, "I don't know, but Saburov interpreted his coming as an omen of an upcoming unrest among the workers."
533473, "Really?"
533474, "Definitely. The Bull Project-from the Abattoir to the railway-is controlled by the Olgimsky family. If Isidor's discovery had anything at all to do with the Kin, Isidor would have certainly relayed it to Vlad. So do make sure to pay a visit to The Lump. That's the name of the Olgimsky mansion... another fitting name, wouldn't you agree?"
533475, "Where does the information come from then?"
533476, "I don't think you're aware of the fact that Isidor came to me last night, just after he had returned, and warned me that there were some... ominous events ahead of us. I took that as an unofficial warning about his upcoming takeover."
533477, "Curious... Thank you for telling me this."
533478, "...So you took measures?"
533479, "Erm. Evidently. I've mobilized the patrols. I see what you're implying, Bachelor, but I'm not insane. Engineering Isidor's murder... as a matter of fact, a strong, indepentent Kin under Isidor's rule would have been way more useful to me."
533480, "Really? Why?"
533481, "Because that would weaken the power of the honourable Vladislav Olgimsky, who's pocketed the economy of the whole town! He'd rather see the Kin as a dumb and speechless herd... And come to think of it... well, I'm sure you understand where I'm going with this."
533482, "I do."
533483, "...This is precisely what Georgiy warned me about..."
533484, "Yes, undoubtedly."
533485, "Why is your house called The Shelter?"
533486, "Let's be friends now. I prefer being friends with everyone."
533487, "Well, it is empty at the moment because...  everyone is grief-stricken. But I usually have a lot of guests. The doors of this house are always open for my friends and for the friends of my friends, day and night."
533488, "You are very kind."
533489, "Was I recommended to you by Maria? Is she your friend?"
533490, "Why are there so few people out in the street?"
533491, "You always have guests, but your face looks sad."
533492, "Who are the 'capital-M' Mistresses then?"
533493, "The Mistresses of the town. We call them the 'Dream Mistresses'. Kaina, Olgimskaya, and Saburova. Now, after Victoria's and Nina's departure, it's their daughters who are trying to see the future. They are far less impressive than their mothers for now, of course... Maria is probably the best."
533494, "Everyone is either sleeping or dreaming. The odour of twyre is something else this year. You can't get away from it. Neither walls, nor cloth, nor glass can help you escape the mind-numbing vapour."
533495, "Does your head ache?"
533496, "Badly. It's nice that you can sleep all day at times like this-but the nightmares are horrible... I can only imagine what kind of hell the Mistresses are going through."
533497, "The Mistresses?"
533498, "It's good to see children continiung the lifework of their parents... Why are you frowning?"
533499, "These clairvoyants terrify me."
533500, "I've come for some sightseeing."
533501, "There was a peculiar incident yesterday by the Spleen. The children were playing in the mud as usual, but then suddenly they ran away from the sandbox and the parents noticed that their hands were smothered in blood. However, none of them were wounded. Neither were any of them surprised."
533502, "Please do."
533503, "A few years ago the child death rate went through the roof here. Six people died in a week. Ten or so came down with serious illnesses. It made us worried, but unfortunately... we couldn't find the cause straight away back then. In the end it turned out that children were dying because of a game."
533504, "What in the world... What kind of a game kills children?"
533505, "They were playing... hmm, what did they call it...? Well, it was some kind of medical game. They were stealing medicine from the adults and making some diabolical mixture out of it. Then they 'healed' each other with it... Back then the game just faded into obscurity, but now I've heard they were contemplating doing it again. Someone has already been poisoned."
533506, "But what can I do? I'm no poisoning specialist. I can do an examination, of course, but..."
533511, "Depends on what you need... According to Katerina, I don't have that much time left. She's a Mistress, isn't she?"
533512, "No, no, it's much simpler. There is a house somewhere in the town, either abandoned or just unoccupied... That's where they play hospital. That's where they store their horrible mixtures. Please, use your standing and your celebrity name to put an end to this game! Capella, Olgimsky's daughter, believes that the house will be unlocked today."
533513, "I'll do my best, of course. How can I find the house?"
533514, "Capella mentioned it's next to one of the ruins. My friend couldn't hear them properly... Have you seen those stone Stairways to Heaven? I think you might even be able to see the house you're looking for from Eva Yan's window. But most importantly, it should be unlocked."
533516, "No, I don't have time for this."
533517, "But what for?"
533518, "I tried to ask the kids, but they don't trust us. They think we want to put an end to this dangerous game because we are mean and stupid adults that simply don't get it... So your arrival has come in very handy."
533519, "So you want me to play with them and gain their trust? That's no simple feat..."
533520, "Oh the terror...."
533521, "And there were no 'shmowders' there."
533522, "I've found one specimen of the... 'shmowders', and I'm going to examine it."
533523, ""
533524, "So nice of you to drop by. What did your visit to the military reveal? Did you get to meet Alexander the Great? Was he a man of astute mind, vigorous imagination, and refined sense of humour? Please be as sincere as possible, the subject is of significant interest to me."
533525, "I don't understand... What would that be for? "
533526, "The Commander wants to know who the woman is. Just tell him the assassin is me. Tell him that whoever else comes to shoot him with a weapon that does not fire is merely a madwoman, keen to sacrifice herself for me. The reason I have plotted an asinine scheme like this is that I need to be placed under house arrest as soon as possible. I'd rather not tell you why I need that."
533527, "Do you think Block will believe me?"
533528, "Of course he will. The Commander sees you as his most reliable confederate. It simply wouldn't occur to him to doubt any information you have relayed to him. Have no fear; the possibility of successful outcome is exceptionally high. "
533529, "Very well. You've convinced me."
533530, "I think I'll talk with Anna first. It seems to me that you're plotting her demise."
533531, "Not before I talk to Lara. It all looks too simple. "
533532, "I got the jitters, what with all this excitement... Fortunately, everything seems to have worked just as it was intended to... if for a single minuscule blunder."
533533, "What blunder?"
533534, "Shots were fired... What was it all about?"
533535, "Exactly."
533536, "Good luck, Yulia."
533537, "There's going to be an attempt on your life. Have you been told already?"
533538, "I seem to have found myself in the middle of a funny story or someone's idiotic practical joke! I recieved a letter, clearly penned by a deranged woman. It warns me about some sort of vigilante in a painfully high-strung manner. The vigilante is herself, right?"
533539, "Thank you, commander."
533540, ""
533541, "Please, don't be surprised with my strange request. I need a pistol. And it must come with bullets... or whatever it is that they shoot."
533542, "Oh my. Yes, it's bullets."
533549, "It's fate... Fate itself has brought him here."
533550, "Fine. I'll get you a pistol. You won't be able to use it properly anyway."
533551, "That's fine. Properly or not, I'll use it to prop up the thing that's fallen apart long ago... but you wouldn't understand."
533552, "I sincerely hope, Lara, that you're not talking about your property."
533553, "Take it. It's a double-barreled pocket pistol. If luck is on your side, it may penetrate plywood."
533554, "Thank you. Here's the thing that I wanted to give you since yesterday."
533555, "The exchange is unequal... but thank you anyway. Perhaps I'll bring it back to you soon."
533556, "I hope you're not talking about me. I want nothing to do with fate."
533557, "DOUBLE BARRELLED PISTOL. An old derringer-type pocket pistol. Has minimal recoil and weak penetrative power. The handle is fashioned for a very small palm, too small even for some women. A last resort weapon."
533558, "POCKET PISTOL. Truly a lady's firearm. Perefectly fits into a petite hand, produces flames, makes noises, and deals negligible damage."

533560, "People are supposed to help each other; that I believe firmly. You may perish yourself, but you should help your fellow being. Extend a hand today to thy neighbour, and he will do the same for you tomorrow. And even if he doesn't-so what? The giver's own virtues will be his consolation all the more!"
533562, "Hey, it's just girls' business, all right? Anyway... I wanted to do a good deed for once, wash away my old stains, so to speak... and that's what I get in return! You won't even appreciate my sacrifice. And I promised to give you the panacea-the sample that I got from Vlad the Younger."
533563, "Fine, give me the little thing. I'll deliver it to Lara."
533564, "Why do you look at me with such... disapproval? Have I done something wrong?"
533565, "I have delivered the pistol to Lara. It's done. "
533566, "And here's the reward... See? I'm giving it to you. I part with it as easily as I acquired it! Well? Do you admire me?"
533567, "Let me talk to Lara first. And this so-called panacea... well, that's an entirely different story."
533568, "I am positively charmed."
533569, "Give me the pistol. I'll do it."
533570, "Take it now! It's safe to put it in your trouser pocket. It won't fire."

533572, "Well knows the kitten whose meat it has eaten, Anna. Ever heard this proverb?"
533573, "'The Three Parcae: Yulia Plays with Fate'"
533574, "It is clear that Yulia wants to shield Lara, even though she tries her best to make it look as though she expects to benefit from it. Is she really inclined to play this kind of game with Fate? Her strategy is simple: she will let the Commander know that the mysterious avenger is none other than her. She expects to suffer the consequences."
533575, "With hardly any consideration, the Commander sent an outfit of his riflemen to Yulia's place. Could it be that she merely wanted armed protection around the clock? If this is the case I'd better take the panacea from her. Who knows if her academic fervour will compell her to test the cure on one of the guards?"
533576, "*** The deed is done. Yulia's fatalism was further reinforced. It appears that everything she does is a part of some intricate plan. Her restless mind is constantly occupied by some furtive activity, invisible but no less dangerous for that."
533577, "'The Three Parcae: Lara Resorts to Murder'"
533578, "Lara wants to kill somebody. She asked me to bring her a smaller pistol, for she is unable to handle that of a regular size. Who does she want to shoot? Even with the tiniest firearm imaginable her escapade would prove to be nothing but a suicide attempt."

533585, "The Changeling's Choice"
533586, "Your father didn't, did he?"
533587, "You are correct-I am willing to admit it, as you can see. Were I not absolutely positive that my father is innocent, I would have never confessed to it even though we share a mutual distaste for one another. Father needed Isidor. He was of much use to him. And that is the ultimate argument in my father's favour."
533588, "Was he useful as a healer?"
533589, "Well, the Olgimskys weren't exactly delighted with Isidor, were they?"
533590, "Isidor came by to see you last night. Don't try to deny it."
533591, "...So what if he did?"
533592, "What were you two talking about?"
533593, "I am also aware of what you two have been talking about. All I want to know is why he left to see Simon afterwards."
533594, "Business, my curious friend... Purely business... I have no interest in... other subjects. And it has nothing to do with you. And with that I bid you... The door's behind you, the big one."
533595, "I'll find out the truth anyway."
533596, "Oh my, oh my... Pray forgive me... So he wanted to bring me to heel, that traitor, that bastard... Well, what he asked for was for me to stop the factory! How could I not kick him out?"
533597, "What were his reasons?"
533598, "His reasons... huh? The bastard! He reasoned he'd pay a visit to my daughter-he knows full well how to pull my strings! Well, I told her to lock the door, so away he went none the wiser... Oh the bastard... So he went to Simon, huh? Thank goodness my loafer of a son is hanging around somewhere... Or else... hm... he could have..."
533599, "Could have what?"
533600, "Huh? That, my dear and respectable friend, is none of your business. My property, like I said, is in order. See the skin and meat delivery reports. Do you know how hard... No way! It's my domain, whether anyone riots or not. And I'll have my way with them!"
533601, "I see, I see. You're the big guy here."
533602, "I'll find everything out eventually."
533603, "What did he tell you? Who else could he have spoken to? Perhaps someone who could take measures... of what kind?"
533604, "What have they run away from? A jail? A bedlam? Or a zoo, judging by their appearance..."
533605, "The Olgimskys have closed the Termitary again! And those who have managed to escape from there are now being hunted. Capella told me all about this. Some of them have ran away and some went into hiding somewhere in the town. And Capella is worried..."
533606, "What is she worried about?"
533607, "Capella and Vlad the Younger are poles apart. Vlad's primary concern is the interests of the family. So the sister is worried that the brother will kill the runaway. She'd rather have him survive the night and escape into the Steppe..."
533608, "What visitors?"
533609, "The ones that made a fire in our backyard. They were coughing, croaking, and groaning at sunrise, remember?"
533610, "Oh, those guys... so what of them?"
533611, "Who is Capella?"
533612, "Big Vlad's daughter. A beloved daughter, too. She is wonderful... and has these abilities... The children follow her as if they were charmed, just like they followed that piper. Well, she said she wanted to save the fugitive from her family's wrath."
533613, "Is that so?"
533614, "Tell me, Eva, what are the ruins outside your window? Is it the Stairway to Heaven?"
533615, "It's on the other side of the Guzzle-this ruin is the one that's closer to the Theatre. It looks better from the second floor."
533616, "What are these ruins? They look ancient, but the construction is recent..."
533617, "Thank you. That's precisely what I wanted to know."
533618, "Oh... That's an old dream of the Stamatins. They are architects, you know. They wanted to overcome the force of gravity. These ruins were a kind of an attempt to do so... They were built by the Peter Stamatin. Can you imagine, they still live here! Still haven't gone back home to the Capital!"
533619, "Who are they? I think I've heard the name... Could you please tell me, if that's not too long a story?"
533620, "It will take as long as you want it to-although one can talk about them for hours. Where should I start? They are brilliant architects. They've built something famous in the Capital... that three-storied garden of frozen springs... Does it ring a bell?"
533621, "The Cold Hall?"
533622, "Yeah! Cold Hall! I haven't seen it, but they say it's unbelievable... And it was they that have built the Polyhedron."
533623, "The Polyhedron is that tower on the other side of the river, right?"
533624, "Really! They died, didn't they?"
533625, "No! They moved here to build the Polyhedron and have been living here since then-it's been almost ten years now... They stayed for Mistress Nina."
533626, "The Polyhedron is that tower on the other side of the river, right?"
533627, "Unbelievable! I'll pay them a visit. They are people of my kind anyhow..."
533628, "Yeah! 'The New Quarter' or 'The Specular Tower' they call it. Do you like it?"
533629, "How does it stand? How is it supported?"
533630, "Unbelievable..."
533631, "I have no idea! That's the mystery. Everyone says it's impossible."
533632, "A miracle..."
533633, "A crazy building..."
533634, "Yes! A real miracle. The only real miracle of all that I've seen. The only miracle so real that you can touch it with your hand. Well, besides you, of course..."
533635, "Okay, okay, I only wanted to know more about the ruins. I need them as a reference point."
533636, "Hah...! Nah, don't compare me to that monstrous construct."
533637, "The Cold Hall... Pretty and modern, but it's nothing special. Although experts say it's a breakthrough."
533638, "Right. I am going to ask you one more question now. Your answer will determine whether you and I become friends or enemies."
533639, "...Well then. I'd rather be your friend. Go ahead."
533640, "What did you talk about? Tell me the truth please."
533641, ".....Isidor said... Note that I'm merely retelling it second-hand! He said there's an epidemic in the steppe camps. An outbreak of tarbagan sickness, perhaps... the plague, that is. Father... Father had issued an order to lock the Termitary up to prevent the infection from getting in."
533642, "And what are you so afraid of that you would conceal this? I don't understand. You did the right thing."
533643, "That is because that would make you betray your father, isn't it?"
533644, "...Yes. Seems it's better to put the cards on the table with you."
533645, "So far you're coming across as a very smart person."
533646, "You've talked to my father already. What do you know?"
533647, "Whatever. I'll outplay you anyway."
533648, "Everything. Almost everything. All I want to know is where you come into play."
533649, "Nothing, but I am counting on your... yes, your conscience. I'll find the whole truth out anyway-sooner rather than later."
533650, "There is an underlying sensitive family matter here. To cut a long story short, my father would kill me if he found out about this conversation... The unrest in the Termitary, you see... well, I incited it to make father lock it up. He didn't believe Isidor."
533651, "I see... Now everything makes sense."
533652, "...We need to warn Rubin, it's very urgent! He is about to examine Simon as soon as the period of time required by the Kains passes. But where is he? I have no idea..."
533653, "Where is he staying?"
533654, "What do you think was the cause of Simon Kain's death? Especially taking into account the fact that Isidor Burakh had been his last visitor."
533655, "Do you think Isidor had already been infected when he spoke with you?"
533656, "He was wrapped in a cloth and smelled of alcohol. He said these were preventative measures. But I still think he could have done all that just to convince me... after failing to convince my father. It was idiotic of me to fall for it!"
533657, "But why?"
533658, "So he could have already been infected when he visited Simon?"
533659, "To stage a coup in the Kin! Isidor had resigned from internal Kin business a long time ago... and he passed his share of patriarchal power-and this power is very special, it's sacred like the power of a housefather... and his power used to be considerable... anyway, he passed it onto another person. Isidor has only been healing since then."
533660, "And now he decided to come back and let Simon know straight away, right? And if the rumours of the plague are true..."
533661, "I'd check every warehouse, of course. Perhaps I'd find something..."
533662, "Oh, your beauty is only matched by your intelligence. You know how to push my buttons. Are you really a sorceress?"
533663, "...What in the world is going on here? Are you trying to flirt with me?"
533664, "Yes, I'm on my last legs too."
533665, "Why are you still up then? Go to bed if your head hurts so much."
533666, "Okay, I'll come by around noon."
533667, "Wait a second... the uni? Were it you juggling knives on the table?"
533668, "Ah! Remember the time when we got the better of those bastards, eh? And you-you sat there all quiet, but when the tables went down, you grabbed the shooter... Yeah, I remember! Very brave of you. Those were the days... And look at me now!"
533669, "Those were the days indeed... Dankovsky-in case you've forgotten. And you are?"
533670, "And you... what do you do now? I believe you left Health Science, didn't you?"
533671, "Do they confuse you two or something?"
533672, "Yeah... sounds about right."
533692, "Andrey, tell me, how can I make the rulers do a reality check?"
533709, "Do you believe in prophecies, Andrey Stamatin? "
533710, "It depends. I agree, this may seem inconsistent with materialism. On the other hand, when your own experience convinces you to their effectiveness, you have to take them into account. Have you been foretold something?"
533711, "The day before yesterday Katerina foretold my untimely death."
533712, "Katerina is not talentless. That means you will die sooner or later. Nothing to be done about it."
533713, "Spoken like a true optimist."
533714, "Uh huh. I didn't take her words seriously either. "
533715, "But you should have, Bachelor Dankovsky. Katerina pales in comparison with the Mistresses of old, there's no denying that; but the gift is in her blood. Do beware. Had Katerina foretold me that I was about to die unless I abandon twiryne, I'd be off the bottle immediately."
533716, "I can foretell you that without any bloodgifts."
533717, "No. But I never expected that I'd be listening to the prophecies of a municipal executive."
533718, "Who are you calling executives?"
533719, "I meant the Saburovs. "
533720, "The Saburovs are a double blunder. We don't have executives in this town. We have rulers, genuine and false. So hear me out: I, Andrey Stamatin, hereby declare that this town can have no ruler but Simon Kain!"
533721, "Simon is dead."
533722, "No! Simon is alive until the murderer has been found. This town needs autocracy. It's time for the triumvirate to go down the drain."
533723, "I sincerely hope these words will stay within the walls of the pub."
533734, "A girl named Anna Angel lives in the neighbourhood. Is she the Angel of 'Thunderstorm' fame?"
533735, "No, that was another one... Also called Angel, yeah. Do you think Anna is a singer? Ha! No one has ever heard her sing-because she's not a singer at all. She's hiding from the Powers That Be here-and any noise scares her shitless."
533736, "What was the crime? "
533737, "She claims to be a political case. But really, look at her-does she really look like she belongs to the underground? She has nothing to do with the February revolt. Although... when there's smoke, there's fire. I think the sweet girl used to serve as a cover for the Ace of Diamonds Caravan. And if my guess is right, I wonder what her position was. We're all monsters here, see? A town of freaks... eh?"
533738, "'Ace of Diamonds'... There was a Guignol play about it... 'The Theatre of Death', right?"
533739, "Right, the Caravan. Don't you remember? The kidnapping story? The accusation of thimbleriggers... have you forgotten that orgy in the Capital? They started killing street performers on sight. Our own Mark Immortell ended up on the run."
533740, "Who is Mark Immortell?"
533741, "The director of our Theatre. A genius puppet-master. He also directs Masks. You should take a look. It's in the Marrow, on Spin-a-Yarn Square."
533742, "I'd like to know more about the local Theatre... if you haven't drunk your tongue out, that is."
533743, "Immortell has dug out some ritual masks of an ancient Steppe cult. Now he's having fun with them-and with himself. Claims that the local mimes can tell the future. As for me, I think he's making fun of the Mistresses-and, by extension, of us all. A motley buffoon."
533744, "A buffoon, huh... that has mastered the art of puppeteering. Curious."
533745, "I will."
533746, "I see. "
533747, "No, this cannot be. I don't believe a girl is capable of such atrocities."
533748, "Sometimes girls are capable of the things that even someone as bloodthirsty as me couldn't have invented."
533749, "Perhaps... But it still doesn't sound right."
533750, "What would you say about Maria? "
533751, "Maria? I'd say that the brilliance of her talent is going to surpass even Nina's one day. Maria will be grabbing stars by the handful while sipping earth's magma. I'm putting great hopes in her! And please note that I seriously mean it. Not a hint of irony in my voice."
533752, "What's the nature of her talent then?"
533753, "Every Kain possesses this gift-the ability to see the unseen and achieve the unachievable. This art doesn't have a name because very few people have mastered it. Maria is concealing her true power for the time being, but it has already become apparent that she will stop at nothing when the time comes. Her sheer power will justify any despotism that would spring from it."
533754, "Are you talking about her fortune-telling abilities?"
533755, "Why are you all so obsessed with fortune-telling? You can't tell a person's fortune; it is a common man's delight. Although you definitely can catch a glimpse of the fortune of the people too weak to fight for it! Man is the sole architect of his fortune. No, I'm talking about the ability to drag the things that are naturally subtle and covert into the daylight!"
533756, "The Kains can do that too?"
533757, "Yeah, sure, please find the certificate verifying their dragging-into-the-daylight talents attached to their wall! It's no fucking child's play! Not a trade that allows to start a small hole-in-the-wall business. If you need illustrative magic tricks, go to the Theatre!"
533758, "Makes sense. No need to get so angry."
533759, "Too bad."
533760, "Amazing. Are you saying that there are records of each of the Kains displaying these abilities?"
533761, "Well, technically that's impossible."
533762, "Andrey, what's your opinion of Victor Kain? "
533763, "Victor is a natural born ruler; he could be doing it all by himself. It's Victor, not Georgiy, who is Simon's true heir. But he wants to leave this place to further his education and get a degree. Treachery, if you ask me."
533764, "Aren't you being too harsh on him?"
533765, "Not at all. The Kains may seem like unpredictable petty tyrants-but we have them to thank for that horrendous civil war passing our town by! The Powers That Be... Can't you see? Instead of building a utopia in this wreck of a country, they're tearing the last scraps of the good that had been done by their predecessors into even smaller scraps. Do you think it's easy to make a stand in a situation like this?"
533766, "Still can't see what Victor has to do with it."
533767, "Somehow-and I can only explain it with sorcery-Simon was able to redirect the games that the Powers That Be play away from our modest town. They never paid attention to us, never violated us, never touched us at all-and the town flourished. Victor was a good disciple to Simon. He'll manage to renew his achievement. Georgiy won't."
533768, "Then why hasn't Victor left yet?"
533769, "His love for Maria is holding him back-he sees Nina's ghost in her, after all... I can relate, too. Living in the town where everything reminds you of her is unbearable. But I'd rather see him grab the power and compel the town to make another turn, bringing it upwards."
533770, "It'll all work out in the end."
533771, "How about another drink?"
533772, "Is that why your brother and you are still living here? "
533773, "Are you implying we're doing it out of cowardice?"
533774, "No, not at all."
533775, "We are creators. Constructors. Builders. Where are we supposed to build? What's the point of erecting a castle on ice if the construction project ends in February?"
533776, "Makes sense."
533777, "February, huh? I think I know what you're getting at."
533778, "That's not impossible."
533779, "You've got a poor sense of humour, friend. You will only leave this pub with your life's blood still attached to you because you are a guest. I will not assault the honour of the people that have offered you protection and hospitality."
533780, "You're completely plastered, friend."
533781, "I apologize."
533782, "Tell me about Grace. "
533783, "Grace... ah! The corpse-lover's daughter... What is there to tell? The daughter of the caretaker of the cemetery; he used to drink like a fish and got his baby girl addicted to twyrine too. Driven her mother to an early grave and would have driven the daughter too, had he not died of that shit himself."
533784, "He offered her twyrine since she was a child? "
533785, "Uh huh. She's not much of a talker. The dead offer her company more often than the living. She used to look after the graves since she was a child-and that obviously messed with her little head. She's a guardian spirit of the local cemetery, just like the Mother Superior is the guardian spirit of the Termitary."
533786, "I'll be damned... "
533787, "Who is the Mother Superior?"
533788, "The daughter of the commandant. She is like an ant queen of the whole dosshouse. Rumour has it, the monsters tend to her every need, spoonfeeding the girl. I'd like to have a look..."
533789, "Well, I never... "
533790, "The Mother Superior? Are you sure we're talking about the same Termitary?"
533791, "There's only one Termitary in the town. Well, two, actually, but they are two halves of a single nutshell. A gigantic dosshouse that had put its roots down into the Abattoir. Just go a bit further to the east. It was built after a huge fire that had destroyed the local settlement... Do take a look, I'd like to hear all about your impressions-that's some masterpiece, huh? That's what the architecture was like half a century ago! And in some places it still is! An abomination..."
533792, "I'll take a look at it."
533793, "I think you've had enough. "
533794, ""
533795, "Everyone says that it's impossible to kill death itself, but I can't let go of the hope that someone might eventually succeed."
533796, "It's just an idea to strive for."
533797, "I've always known that I'd throw everything away and follow the man who achieves that to the ends of the earth. If he wouldn't have me as a partner, I'd serve him. If he wouldn't have me by his side, I'd serve him from the shadows."
533798, "Are you that afraid of death?"
533799, "Utterly..."
533800, "There is no need to fear death."
533801, "I'll try to help you people. I really will."
533802, "So that's why you love this town so much. It seemed to you that Simon had achieved that."
533803, "You really are very smart."
533804, "I hope I can do the impossible."
533805, "When you're surrounded by the people who, when told about an infectious disease, rush after some glowing maneater, smarts become useless."
533807, "Doctors are said to be the people whose very job is to defeat death."
533818, "Curious... I'd like to have a look at it."
533819, "Living people are forbidden to get on that train. The only person allowed to come aboard is the deaf-and-dumb odongh driver. Only he can guide the train through the Steppe."
533820, "Who is it?"
533821, "Andrey Stamatin, the architect. He is a very menacing and strong man. He treats me in a slightly condescending manner, but you can speak to him on my behalf, he won't refuse; and I think even Andrey doesn't want to rot of the Sand Plague."

533869, "Don't even think about it! I need to broadcast a general order tomorrow. Everyone is to stay in-or be arrested and made to stay in."
533870, "Hmm... Yes, perhaps I put too much trust into him. He seemed like a very reliable man to me."
533871, "A reliable man is exactly who he is. Which makes it doubly worrying that he would act this way."
533872, "And what exactly does Rubin say? Did he release any results of his research yet?"

533874, "With all due respect, that is none of your concern, Yulia."

533878, "Do you know of any evidence that would confirm there is indeed an outbreak?"
533879, "......What did you say? Oh, so that's how it is... Give me a moment, please, I need to think."
533880, "This is very important."
533881, "Think faster, dear lady."
533882, "......I apologise sincerely, but I cannot speak of this. I am bound by a word given. Speak to my father."
533883, "What the hell?"
533884, "People are going to die, Victoria. A lot of them."
533885, "I will take my own measures. Still, I am not allowed to talk to you about this."

533887, "I'm begging you!"
533888, "I am not allowed to talk about this. Yes, now I see what these strange places are..."

533897, "Why are the three ruling families at odds?"
533898, "We'll all die in due time."
533899, "So, I will always be able to find room and board at your place?"
533900, "You will. Take this as a reward too. These are nuts. I've been given some today; it's great luck... They must have come from an old cache. Do you know how to use them?"
533901, "...Crack them before eating... What else am I supposed to do with nuts?"
533902, "No, don't eat them! Barter them. Our children would turn themselves inside out for these nuts. Keep that in mind, especially if you want to barter for something dangerous."
533903, "I do, I do... Thank you, Lara."
533904, "Why do they value nuts so highly?"
533905, "It's an old game. A child takes a nut and sends it on all sorts of adventures. At some point adults took all nuts away from the kids; they thought this game provoked them to do something risky themselves. The most wonderful thing is that the children remember almost every nut in the town by heart."
533906, "What, does each one of them have a story of its own or something?"
533907, "Perhaps they have names too?"
533908, "I think so. Well, anyway, it's pure treasure."
533909, "Really? Nut currency? Well, thanks for the present. So, inside out, you say?"
533910, ""
533911, "The medicine should be enough for today. If they regain consciousness, you may talk. When they fall into a new fit, we'll lock the door again."

533914, "Well, lady caretaker, will you tell me about the maneater?"
533915, "Are you looking for the haireater too? I'm telling you, I don't know who she is. She just ran off straight away and didn't speak to me."
533916, "The what-eater? Who is that?"
533917, "Shabnak-adyr, the naileater. Everybody's looking for her. They say I let her eat the dead. But I didn't! I have no idea where she came from..."
533918, "Calm down. Who is this eater?"
533919, "Yesterday morning I found an empty grave! Maybe the strange girl with spiteful eyes slept there? But now they tell me that it was shabnak hiding in there this whole time and that I wasn't watchful enough. Not true! I know who lies in my graves. Only my dead go there."
533922, "Tell me about the girl."
533923, "Ok-kay.... Another brilliant specimen. You could teach Katerina a thing or two by the looks of it. Hello..."
533924, "Hello. Don't be angry please."
533925, "Come on, I can't be angry with you..."
533926, "The girl dropped several fishing hooks and a lockpick. I'll give you the lockpick if you want! I'd give you the hooks too, but I've offered them to the dead already, sorry. Do you know how good an omen a hook is? It's by the hook that the ancestors pull the souls of those who has achieved salvation up. So the souls get dragged to our world from underneath first, and then they go to heaven..."
533927, "You are a very kind girl, Grace. Thank you."
533928, "A lovely lockpick. I would rather have the hooks though. You can't neglect such an effective talisman."
533930, "That's it, I'm leaving. Your silly talk is really annoying, you know!"
533931, "You shouldn't be angry with me. It's not my fault that I'm no good at talking... Here, take this as a keepsake... Don't be angry..."
533932, "Forgive me, Grace. I shouldn't have been rude to you. You just cannot imagine how upsetting all this talk of the supernatural is!"
533933, "Don't be angry with me. Will you accept my gift?"
533934, "What the hell is this?"
533935, "What is it?"
533936, "What? Who? Came from where? I don't understand a word you're saying."
533937, "Yes, it was a weird creature... Either a man, or a girl, or a snakesister... Or maybe those were rats... But the more I think about her, the more I'm convinced it was a girl."
533938, "Are you making this nonsense up on purpose?"
533939, "Grace, do you think it's a game? Or was that professional slang?"
533940, "Look! A strange grave appeared here yesterday. No one dug it, I've asked around. It just appeared."
533941, "Next thing you tell me it was dug from the inside..."
533942, "It was! How do you know? It wasn't dug out with a spade. It's as if someone dug it with their hands and came out of there!"
533943, "And the clawed traces lead to The Crucible, don't they?"
533944, "They don't."
533945, "I don't have time for this chit-chat..."
533946, "No! I've talked to them already. It's not anybody's joke. No one dug it. And they won't tell me anything either..."
533947, "Calm down."
533948, "I'll speak to the diggers. Maybe it was a joke."
533950, "This is rubbish. A scab on stone walls?"
533951, "I know what I'm talking about! That thing's carrying the disease, that's why it's so creepy... What if it crawls further? And no one cares! The guys tried to tell them: if you see blood leaking from under a door, that's where a mara-a shabnak, I mean-has had a feast. But no one believes them guys. Is it better never than late or something?"
533952, "Your questions are very indiscreet. You've only known me for one day, en-Daniil. I've known you for a little longer... Your curiosity will be sated in a little while. Allow me to torture you with obscurity for now. On the other hand... it's very simple. He's a genius."
533953, "Really? He must be constantly exposed to vicious hatred..."
533954, "I do not care in the slightest for the things that have to do with you, Maria. Stop imagining things."
533955, "Imagination is my gift. A wonderful gift. A gift that doesn't live long-and who can tell how long I will be able to enjoy it? So let me be myself."
533956, "I apologize."
533958, "Yes, I admit, the joke was lousy."
533959, "Tell me, master Vlad, do you believe that we're facing a real epidemic hazard?"
533960, "Hey, Grief... Who killed Simon?"
533961, "You think I did?"
533962, "I'm not thinking anything. I'm asking a question."
533963, "Askin', huh? How could a man that's been foolin' around with them afterworld shenanigans not die? Ain't nothin' good about stickin' your nose to where us humans are neither welcome nor wanted. Don't trouble trouble until trouble troubles you. Right, Doc?"
533964, "So you think Simon's been killed by a supernatural creature?"
533965, "No one is to blame for his death. It's all been comin' to this, Doc, it was. You tease death, and it'll snatch you up. I've seen some shit, I've got experience, mate, so I know what I'm sayin'. 'N Simon did tease it. So he saw it comin'. Show me who's blamin' a man or a ghoul for it, and I'll spit 'em in the eye..."
533966, "You only say that because your men are the first to come under suspicion."
533967, "Well, one could say that too, Doc... You ain't too short on them smarts, eh? But still, there has to be a higher meanin' to his death. The old fart's been here for too long, Lord have mercy on his soul 'n all that... too long."
533968, "Everything will clear up after I examine the body."
533969, "I will take your opinion into account, kind sir."
533970, "Don't try to weasel your way out of this one. People blame fate when they can't be bothered to bear responsibility for their own misdeeds."
533971, "It was one of your guys' doing, wasn't it? Admit it!"
533972, "I do."
533973, "What's with the street hysteria, women getting killed? Are those your men at work?"
533974, "No way... my folks are only catchin' tiny lil' fish in muddy water, nothin' more. Would they go lookin' for trouble at a time like this? Why would they cut beggars anyway? The ones after 'em girls in the streets are your honest workin' bees, scared shitless... Got themselves hung over twyrine, got themselves grim fear knockin' on the back of their necks, and boom! Batshit insane they go..."
533975, "You've got a silver tongue, haven't you?"
533976, "Well, you've got a keen mind, mate. You'll find youself a killer, Doc, you will. Each passin' hour spawns a ton more of those. You're bound to catch at least one by the end of the day, I figure."
533977, "I will. I'll find the one that will leave even you scared... witless."
533978, "Being smart, are we?"
533979, "Yes, you are all dismissed."
533996, "Yes, seems like we've been betrayed."
533997, "These noises are driving me insane... I'm not sure if I'm seeing things-or if hell has finally come after me."
533998, "Do you like Eva? "
533999, "I do. I don't think she's lecherous. I love it that she's eager to unclothe her loins at any opportune moment-never ashamed of her nudity in the slightest. She may seem lewd, but that's just her personality trait. Eva is overflowing with unrequited love. She fell in love with my creation when it was merely a design."
534000, "What do you mean? "
534001, "Erm-haven't you seen the Polyhedron yet? Head straight there immediately and do not dare come back to me until you've seen it on the inside! How is that even...? Look at him, having spent two says in this mudhole already and not having seen the only thing worth seeing here at all..."
534002, "I've seen the Polyhedron. "
534003, "The creations of my haggard mind bewilder people. Sometimes they even inspire awe-but never love. Even the children, who can't live without it at all, who spend their days being there and playing there; in truth even the children cannot stand it. It's unwieldy and ill-suited for life. To fall in love with it, you have to have a vivid imagination... and a huge heart."
534004, "Eva qualifies, I take it."
534005, "Undoubtedly. She could have become the soul of my creation, but for some reason she hasn't... Any idea why?"
534006, "I'll tell you if I find out. "
534007, "No idea at all."
534008, "You mean the tower across the river? "
534009, "Yes. "
534010, "In my opinion, it deserves admiration and respect."
534011, "There is an Anna Angel, a singer, living around here, right?"
534012, "There is. Poor Anna has lost her voice. I... sympathize with her because I... can relate. Also because she keeps her chin up-and I hate whiners! Thirdly, I can't shake the feeling that she's facing someone else's music... reaping the consequences of someone else's sin..."
534013, "What do you mean? "
534014, "Day by day, she's waiting for a visitor who is going rip out her soul. This is the torture a lesser person wouldn't be able to bear."
534015, "Who is this visitor? "
534016, "Theories abound. Rumour has it, she used to seduce certain people for the benefit of smugglers or conspirators-but personally I don't believe it. "
534017, "Me neither."
534018, "Everything happens..."
534019, "Tell me about Maria Kaina. "
534020, "She's a star. The star. Maria is flawless. They say that she lacks internal self-control, that she can go to any length. That is also a lie. Her self-control is staggering-it's just that she loves her mother too much. She tries to imitate Nina's style."
534021, "Is that a bad thing?"
534022, "It doesn't matter. Whatever Maria does, she deserves to have any sin absolved-if only for the sheer fact that she begets true magic. And if the price of it are her insane escapades, so be it. We'll make do."
534023, "That's some daring logic."
534024, "That's impossible. I'm yet to see a flawless person."
534025, "What about Victor Kain? Do you like him at all?"
534026, "Victor was the only person that Nina used to obey not out of fear, but having recognized his superiority. She used to obey Simon and Georgiy as well-but she followed their words like any person when commanded by an elder. It was merely her way to pay tribute to their family's strict traditions. And yet she rendered complete obedience to Victor, even though he never asked for it."
534027, "So what's your point?"
534028, "Exactly. It's mysterious. How did he manage to bring this demon to his heel-and why did he allow her absolute freedom of choice? Basically, Victor is hiding something. I think he's waiting for Georgiy to make an unpopular move to finally show his real face. Just kidding."
534029, "I don't find your jokes funny."
534030, "Well, many wives obey their husbands, don’t they?"
534031, "Wives like Nina? No way in hell. She was the one and only in every respect; the only woman like this to ever walk this earth."
534032, "Why did she obey him then? "
534033, "Then stop drinking to excess! How is it possible that you have absolutely no respect for your wondrous head?"
534034, "Well... I understand, Peter. Your Tower is here."
534035, "My tower is a little... topsy... turvy... tipsy? Is it here?"
534036, "Have some sleep, Peter. You've had enough for today."
534037, "Believe me, I know how you feel! This was the very phrase I uttered when I came to this wretched town."
534038, "Whether it falls or not? It's been standing there for quite some time..."
534039, "You're better off without them."
534040, "Are you gladdened by the Fourth Army's advances?"
534041, "Of course I do. Where force is useless, talent saves the day. One has to admit we are lucky to have commanders like that; worthy heirs of the heroic era. If Shoin breaks through on the southern front and Block moves out to meet him near Orlog... chances are that the war will be over soon."
534042, "Block's army is in tatters. I heard he barely has any units left that are fit for combat..."
534043, "Yes, and that is because those bastards at the HQ have been using him as cover. They throw him at the most hopeless operations and try to kill two birds with one stone-delivering a crippling blow to the enemy and getting rid of the hero! Heroes have always been an inconvenience to the Powers That Be."
534046, "That would be great..."
534047, "So very true!"
534048, "But they have the assistance of the inquisitors attached to the armies."
534049, "It's all right, though. Both Shoin and Block have always fought against superior numbers, and yet Shoin has always been victorious. Block was greatly outnumbered at the Karstov Fords, but..."
534050, "Yes, that battle will be in the annals of the art of war."
534051, "It's fine. I'm just picking the perfect spot for my grave."
534052, "And now it ends badly for him... the anarchitect!"
534053, "'Oh please', 'oh help'... They're right to say that the devil finds work for idle hands to do!"
534054, "No way..."
534055, "Well, I had a suspicion of my own..."
534056, "Really? Well, that means you'd make a wonderful inquisitor-a better than one than me, perhaps. It only dawned on me how unfortunate a role I am to play in this mission on my way here. Miraculously. Here's my first question then: what for did they hatch this plan?"
534057, "Erm... I apologize. I'll do my best not to interrupt you from now on."
534058, "I have a feeling that it was hatched because of me."
534059, "Well, not exactly... But broadly speaking..."
534060, "Are you intending to build a new world? "
534061, "Are you all right, girl? Feeling sick, maybe?"
534062, "Someone's going to have to cleanse away the filth. The party of the Humble will lay itself upon the altar of the common good... and people will hate us, instead of mourning our sacrifice. Only those we take with us will grow to love us... This is what will be. Thus say I, and the Mistress heeds my words."
534063, "To what end?"
534064, "...Who in the world could possibly bring this miracle here? "
534065, "Hang on... has governor Saburov heard this diatribe yet?"
534066, "Good move. It will put them on a false trail."
534067, "Certainly. I'm retiring from the ongoing affairs. "
534068, "It's fine, there's always next time. Panic would be the least helpful thing right now."
534069, "I've had the pleasure of meeting one of them-and he was a fugitive criminal."
534070, "Why did they choose this very herb? "
534071, "Swevery does indeed have healing properties. But that is not the point, of course. Beaker's brothers, for example, didn't wrap their powders at all-it was they who introduced the fashion of using antique boxes. The effect of their remedies was the same."
534072, "Where are these powders now? "
534073, "Ahem... I think I can see where they're coming from-I would have done the same. In all honesty, I'm burning with curiosity... and greed. "
534074, "Where exactly?"
534075, "To the Silent House, I believe. That is where the infection began to spread from in the first place... and besides, it's connected to this terrible maneater story. Children are always attracted to horror stories... All in all, I think you can stop them. If you ban the game, they'll listen to you. You are a celebrity doctor after all! "

534080, "Well... Simon? "
534081, "I beg you on my knees... Go to him... see for yourself that he is alive... and let the Inquisitor rend the Kains to pieces... Aglaya will be happy, because the only good thing in her is her hatred of the Kains!"

534083, "Well, now you do. Oh, how generously shall she reward you for the news... for exposing the villains... on the eve of everyone's doom... a truly heroic deed... so why won't you do it? I ask for so little..."

534094, "...It's all true. I broke Simon down into particles. Anything that couldn't be used to make the vaccine, I burned. There is no mistake. Can't you see; only that wondrous organism could produce the white vaccine-the one that's still keeping hundreds of people alive. I give you my word."
534095, "Very well. Then my path takes me to the Crucible once again. Just as nine days ago... when your Master directed me there."

534104, "Ask. I shall answer as clearly as I can. Do you know why ghosts always speak in riddles? It used to puzzle me-after all, I've never felt compelled to resort to allegory in order to draw conclusions from my visions. Now I know the answer. Their consciousness is fragmented."
534105, "You mean he must himself agree that I paint him as insane?"
534106, "Yes. Go to him. Talking to him will open your eyes to the truth. You are a perceptive man, after all. Help us. Such rumours would be very inopportune. And please accept some money. It will be of use in shutting up a few particularly big mouths."

534112, "The truth about Simon Kain is the kind of truth that may only be explained to those ready to accept it. They want to know what happened to his body? Very well. Simon Kain was afflicted with the Sand Plague. His body has been torn into droplets and fibers. It's a pity that we now cannot produce his remains before the non-believers. What are they to find comfort in now?"
534113, "...But that's not true, is it?"
534114, "Not entirely true, but true enough to satisfy a vigorous mind like hers. Temporary lives will depart so that the eternal lives will be reborn. Go now, my boy. You are no mystic after all."

534122, "Rubin gave me his word that Simon Kain no longer exists. He claims to have burnt every particle of Simon's body that was not processed to create the vaccine. In this case the answer is to be found in the Crucible. Let the Kains themselves explain what is going on there."
534123, "Something strange is happening here. Everything I see in the Crucible bears a trace of insanity. Victor says I should trust Georgiy when he tells me of his own madness. But is it even remotely plausible that a madman would corroborate his own condition? Not at all. What is it then?"
534124, "Georgiy is free of any mental disease. However... This is not the same Georgiy I knew. Something has changed. Is this some kind of a game? Or does he genuinely believe he is his own brother? Perhaps he is misled by an ill-conceived sense of moral obligation? Aglaya Lilich is the last oasis of reason amidst all this madness. I should tell her about Georgiy's request."

534187, "A rare quality. "

534205, "None of it is real, so no. He's been in a fire, he's hunted a shabnak, he's cut off a button from Vlad's belly, and topped it off with spending a night in Nina's crypt. Gee, what a daredevil, tell me another. Try living here as long as we do, taste some thief's knife-and you'll sing a very different tune. Chestnut glory."
534206, "Chestnut glory?"
534207, "Don't you know our game of chestnuts? You put a mark on a chestnut, give it a name and send it on trials. Fry it in fire, drown it in water, put it under a train... The more it endures, the more honour it has. Any new trial raises its worth. That's what Sticky does with himself."
534208, "Is it a real game? "
534209, "Yep. It draws people in, you know... you gotta know what's next. Sometimes it happens that a lad's already dead but his chestnuts live on. You won't put a chestnut like that under a train anymore... I have one that's been through two hundred and four trials! Including the train and the rat-house."

534226, "Tell me more about those performances."
534227, "You see, there must be somethnig fishy about it! They say they tell your fortune, right? Might be just a game, might be not; it does come true. I think though that it's Mark himself who manipulates the events to align someone's life with his ideas. Get it?"
534228, "So do the predictions come true or don't they?"
534229, "I mean, they do come true, though not every time, and if they don't, he explains it away as a metaphor, or says they did come true but we didn't notice. How can you catch someone like that lying? He's always got the answer."
534230, "Well, that's an occupational hazard."
534233, "Don't trust worthless gossip, young man."
534234, "I don't. It's impossible."

534253, "Like the back of my hand... the son of a bitch!"
534254, "Whoa, you're harsh on that one. Something personal?"
534255, "They're all sons of bitches, these thieves! Beastly monsters, especially the ones from the Steppe. They're always drunk on twyrine, they stalk the place like evil souls of this hellish herb. They cross someone's hand with silver, I can even guess whose hand it is... I won't name names though."
534256, "Why are you living by their side then?"
534257, "Why, would you prefer to send us orphans to live in the Steppe? We don't get to pick a place. Let the ones who banished us here be ashamed! If it were up to us, we'd be in the Polyhedron now with all the others. For now, though, here we are, under the thugs' nose."
534258, "And who was it that banished you here?"
534259, "This, doctor, is none of your business. Have you killed Simon's killer yet? Chop-chop, time's running out..."
534260, "You watch your tongue..."
534261, "Point taken."
534262, "If you live like them, you'll meet the same end as them."
534263, "How do the rulers tolerate them?"
534264, "How could they not? Those guys are officialy storekeepers, their own masters. Railway men. The Warehouses are owned by the railway, as it happens. And railways are none of our concern; they were built by the Powers that Be. It's their dominion. Also, the thieves are sort of living by themselves. With a proper share of smuggling too. I know everything about them..."
534265, "You're a quick one."
534266, "Stop cursing, boy!"
534267, "Don't get too excited, lad..."
534268, "Ha! 'Bad luck'... Are you completely mental?"
534269, "I've been told that this is the place where this, y'know, sort of tongue comes out of the ground, a tongue made of dirty lumps. Like made of thick air... You're standing at that exact spot, sir."
534270, "You go home at once! You're grounded!"
534271, "I can't. I gave a promise. It would be a disgrace to my honour!"
534272, "I will if you leave at once. And give me the shmowder."
534273, "Cut it! Good kinds do not tell lies. Give me the thing and get out of here."
534274, "Run back to your crowd and tell them that I've banned the test since shmowders are deadly rather than curative. I'll testify that you stood your ground until the very end."
534275, "All right. I suppose I'm in no position to argue... But you will confirm what really happened here, right? If anyone asks?"
534276, "Give it to me. I'll test it myself."
534277, "You know what? Hell if I care. Do whatever you please."
534279, "I'm looking for Barley, the leader of the barbers. Do you know where his hideout could be?"
534280, "Nah... I tried to sniff around, but no luck. Notkin's Soul-and-a-Halves tracked him down though. They've got dogs, which helps with tracking."
534281, "Will Notkin tell me?"
534282, "No way. No use even trying. The Soul-and-a-Halves want to finish the barbers off themselves and take full credit for it. That's, like, a matter of life and death for Notkin. A chance to crush every possible competition-both Grief and Khan-and a chance to show off in front of the Mother Superior. He's doing it for her."
534283, "That's a shame..."
534284, "But I think I know how to trick them."
534285, "Tell me."
534286, "The Soul-and-a-Halves are staking out the house where Barley's hiding. They keep coming and going there. You can follow one of them or one of their dogs. Just hang around their Castle a bit; they'll be sending a runner to the post soon enough. Just make sure to be stealthy-if they spot you, they'll make sure to lead you away."
534287, "Thank you for the advice."
534288, "This request does you credit. I was certain you would ask for yourself. "
534290, "I haven't finished yet... Apart from that, I wish they stopped... torturing me about the Termitary. I'm tired of repeating that it's clean. That is why it was closed in the first place. "
534291, "You know what? You've just suggested an excellent idea to me. How about this: you stop the persecution-and I'll kindly spare the Kains my opinion on what's inside the Termirary?"
534292, "This won't happen before I closely examine the Termitary myself. So, unfortunately, we are unlikely to find a compromise, boös Vlad. Farewell. "
534293, "For goodness' sake... If you put it like this... Yes, certainly... certainly... I was going to... as well... It's no matter now... Now that the Skinners is infected-just like the Crude Sprawl before it... You have my word as a merchant. The thing is-I know you as a man of honour. Damn it... "
534294, "I'm glad we have an agreement, boös Vlad. The word of a merchant provides a reliable assurance."
534295, "Do keep in mind that you've given yourself away more than I could have ever expected!"
534299, "I want to settle the dispute between us and the Kains concerning our unwillingness to let emissaries into the Termitary. I don't know what the Kains are thinking, but we are not harbouring anything or anyone there that could be of even remote interest to them-especially to my deeply esteemed fellow Victor."
534300, "So why don't you let the inspectors in?"
534301, "First of all, it's dangerous. The rabble is rioting. I've told you about that more than once already. Secondly, father will not submit to the younger Kain's orders. If this keeps up, we'll soon be taking orders from his ten-year-old son!"
534302, "I'm doing this not on the Kains' orders, but at their request. And I act on my authority, not theirs."
534303, "Sounds... elaborate. Very well then. I'll give you one more reason to keep the Termitary closed for as long as possible. Frankly speaking, it's you who should have prohibited us from letting anyone in there-even yourself. It's your direct duty."
534304, "You mean quarantining the place?"
534305, "Exactly. Fortunately, we locked the Termitary off a day before the Sand Dirt came to our town. Should the Kains insist, I have an argument that will easily convince both them and you. You require proof of the veracity of my words too, don't you?"
534306, "I'm listening."
534307, "The Kains are hiding something too... They have their own skeleton in the closet, and it's even more unsightly than ours. Our closet is full of our own workers; theirs is full of other people's children. If you can make sure that... everything is well inside the Polyhedron, then trust me, the Termitary is fine too. It's an enclave. A closed chamber."
534308, "So you believe that quarantine will be effective in keeping the infection out of that giant bunkhouse?"
534309, "Certainly. Did you not say yourself-at least that's how it was relayed to me-that walls are a solid defense? Besides, think of what will happen if ten thousand people pour into the streets in search of food and gossip. Try to imagine the picture."
534310, "Sounds convincing. I'll inspect the Polyhedron and talk to Victor, but I'll ask a favour of you in return: help me find Simon's body."
534311, "Try to curb the righteous anger of the Judge and the terrible Victor; they seem to have finally decided to harass my father to death. I have no doubt that no matter what he did, it's not his fault. If you do that, I will gladly assist you."
534312, "Deal."
534313, "I'm doing this for the Kains... but I doubt that my success here can infringe upon your family's interests."
534314, "Was the Polyhedron closed after the Termitary? "
534315, "And it was much closer to the original source of the plague. To Simon Kain."
534316, "Sounds convincing. I'll inspect the Polyhedron and talk to Victor, but I'll ask a favour of you in return: help me find Simon's body."
534317, "Very well. Let's have it that way. I want to help."
534318, "What would you ask in return? "
534319, "Nothing much. The information concerning the disappearance of Simon Kain's body-specifically the place where Rubin could have taken it."
534335, "You must have already noticed that anyone's chances to escape the epidemic unscathed are rather low. I can increase theirs."
534363, "*** I cannot change the mind of this man! Let them sort their own business! I'd better have someone else take care of Rubin's affairs."
534364, "This is some invaluable information, Bachelor; I am much obliged. I will allow Rubin a chance to explain himself before the day ends... perhaps there was nothing else he could do under the circumstances. Nevertheless, the reward I was going to pay for any information concerning Simon's whereabouts is rightfully yours to claim."
534365, "Thank you. "
534366, "I don't need anything."
534367, "Just don't bring the body directly to The Crucible and don't forget to quarantine your people before they return to their everyday duties."
534368, "Is that what you think?"
534369, "He's known about the infection for a long time. We just agreed to keep it secret."
534370, "Why should I? "
534376, "Most curious! What is it?"
534377, "Vlad the Younger asked me to tell you the following: the Termitary had been closed before the Polyhedron was, and there are many witnesses to that."
534378, "Really? What is he getting at?"
534379, "He has no reason to believe that the situation inside the Termitary is different from that inside the Tower. "
534380, "My son has now founded a kingdom of his own. There it is, towering above our sinful earth. He wouldn't let anyone into that world-not even his own father. If you're interested to know what's going on there, give it a try. Maria thinks you're a man for whom nothing is impossible."
534381, "Yes. I'll follow your advice. "
534382, "I, too, have long been interested in what's going on inside that place. "
534383, "I'm just relaying his words to you."
534384, "I'm the one who's listening, boy. Tell me about this structure."
534385, "Yes. I suppose it's enough. "
534386, "It's a mystery. You won't be able to fathom it. Do you see these walls? "
534387, "Yes. "
534388, "I thought so. We children do not see them. There, on the left, is the coast of the New Sea. Behind you are the Cleft Islands. Behind my left shoulder-the Knot of the Five Footpaths. And the facet a little way to the left from it is actually the collapsed bridge from the legend of the Ever-Reborn."
534389, "Is this some practical joke?"
534390, "I see now. It's a poetic allegory. You're all dreamers in here."
534391, "What are the walls you see made of, Guest? "
534392, "Hm... Looks like paper to me."
534393, "I'm not sure... thick cardboard? "
534394, "Strange. Very strange. The average thick-headed grown-up sees mirrored surfaces. It's the reason they're calling this the Specular Tower. Each person only sees an infinite series of their own reflections. That was the design."
534395, "Are there really a thousand children in here? "
534396, "Yes. But they're all on the other side of the facets. You can't see them, but they see you clearly. The facets are a reliable barrier."
534397, "Against what? "
534399, "Please do stay in."
534400, "What? No, I am not getting anywhere. Just sharing my observations."
534401, "Clara is with her too. The miracle-worker girl."
534402, "Did she propose killing? That sounds convincing enough. Katerina has always found evil attractive."
534403, "I see."
534404, "Fifteen hundred people? How can a frail stairway support such weight?"
534405, "They are children. That is exactly why adults are not allowed in-the frail stairway wouldn't be able to support the weight for long... Do not worry. The Tower has been standing for a long time. It will not collapse, unless toppled deliberately and maliciously."
534406, "Is it magical then?"
534407, "This is impossible. A utopia."
534408, "This entire place is a utopia. A place that should not exist."
534409, "I suppose so. Now I see why you're awed by it."
534410, "Yes. This is actual magic. Doubly so, since it obeys human will."
534411, "That's impossible. Miracles are always short-lived... sadly."
534412, "Then I see why you're awed by it."
534413, "Fine. What's your plan?"
534414, "Still, what does Rubin have to do with this?"
534415, "I'm convinced that it was those people who stole the body from him. Are you interested in finding out where they could have taken it?"
534416, "Absolutely."
534417, "*** I commited betrayal. Rubin is in grave danger now."
534418, "It's nothing too astonishing. This Tower has been standing here for more than a decade."
534419, "Unbelievable... "
534420, "The child speaks like a grown man. His manner leaves an impression. Could it be that Olgimsky is right? If the Termitary is protected from any external influence as diligently as this Tower is, I can exclude both buildings from my inquiry for now."
534421, "I've already been there."
534422, "It seems that reciprocal hatred is not in Eva's heart. My soft-mannered host wants to shelter a runaway serf from the punishment that the authorities would mete out on him if he is caught. It would appear I am not the only person chasing a criminal tonight..."
534423, "The younger Olgimsky exhibits a genuinely traditional kind of filial piety. Or is he pursuing some projects of his own? One way or another, he is determined to get rid of the beastlike troublemaker. I wonder what the creature-whose death has no legal consequences-looks like?"
534424, "Out of curiosity."
534425, "You know, Saburov hates Peter; he wants to get back at him for something. I must protect him. If only Saburov seizes the power he is so hopelessly trying to obtain, Peter will be the first to stand at the Bone Stake."
534426, "I've come to know him recently... that's all."
534427, "As you wish."
534430, "And who would, say, want to kill Peter?"
534431, "I see. What do they look like?"
534432, "On whose orders? Beats us. There, that smart man over there, ask him."
534433, "Yeah, an obviously reliable source of information born and bred, that one..."
534434, "Disperse, all of you! Nothing to see here!"
534435, "And who would that be?"
534436, "People! Gather around-or better yet, call for your neighbours and relatives and nearest and dearest! For the meaning behind this is as follows: the Kains' tower is killing our town! The bull here represents the town. And the sharp stake, this shameful stake, is a symbol of the Kains' vile creation, their obscene philosophizing!"
534437, "Why do you have to shout... Have mercy on our ears..."
534438, "What's gotten into you, dear sir?"
534439, "Wipe them out, the monsters! Simon was a monster, for his sins had brought this pestilence upon us! And Maria, his granddaughter, would soon reach the stars and ply us to her will with her magics, just as her mother Nina used to in days past! She must be killed, torn apart and thrown for the people's relish!"
534442, "Last time I'm warning you..."
534443, "You dirty swine! You're inciting a riot!"
534444, "...What is this creature? Where did you get such a thing?"
534445, "The news that you have gone mad, Judge."
534446, "Here is my final request. Tell the Inquisitor that Georgiy Kain has gone insane, and that our family is in preparation for collective suicide. That should do. Perhaps she will even leave you alone for another day or two."
534447, "What in the world are you talking about?"
534448, "Uncle is preparing to die... I am preparing to be awakened... My father... will not be here for long."
534449, "Wait... Maria is related to you?"
534450, "Yes. The most beloved of my family. But my love is unrequited. She's prejudiced against me. I hurt her in the past, and then she was told terrible things about inquisitors. A silly childish prejudice. Now that we are both young women of similar age, a new meeting should help wash old memories away."
534451, "How can I assist you in that?"
534452, "I don't wish to force my way into a beloved person's home. I need an invitation to come in... Convince her that I mean her no harm! Or just take me to her and tell her 'Here, I've brought you a new friend...' and the let me speak."
534453, "Even if that is true, this doesn't concern anyone but us."
534454, "Why can't you meet her on your own?"
534455, "No. Maria is too capricious. When it comes to love and hate, she won't listen to anyone."
534456, "If the town's fate really rests on your meeting, I will do everything within my power."
534457, "...Intuition."
534458, "She admitted to it!"
534459, "Precisely."
534460, "Why are you so sure of that?"
534461, "...You are a representative of the Powers That Be, aren't you?"
534462, "I have nothing to fear."
534463, "But who's the carrier then?"
534464, "The source, you mean? All the ventures up until now had one firm, yet criminal and idiotic, goal in mind-to make you look anywhere but the one place they were afraid you would find something! Why are you so sure that the source is a living person?"
534465, "It's in my reports. Everything adds up to confirm that hypothesis. "
534466, "They did everything they could to make you think so. They'd throw you pieces of information to that effect, even the most ridiculous of them, while concealing anything that would point to the contrary. And all that, mind you, with a genuine desire to stop the epidemic and preserve this whole... utopia."
534467, "By preventing me from finding out the truth? That's absurd!"
534468, "What does this have to do with the Powers That Be? I gathered information from the locals. I discovered my own arguments."
534469, "And where did the locals get the information? You think it wasn't from the Executors?"
534470, "Executors? What do those corpse carriers have to do with anything?"
534471, "How did you find that out? "
534472, "Of course not. I know."
534473, "I know nothing of that. Ask Stamatin yourself. Then again, no! Don't."
534475, "By the way, Bachelor, have you by any chance heard of the outrageous event that happened yesterday...?"
534476, "How can you prove it?"
534477, "I am content with the accounts of two extremely reliable prosecutors. They know for sure that the yesterday's pictogram in the Lot was created by Maria. The first is a man that has been selflessly in love with Maria for a long time now-and has recently come to know some of her secret doings."
534478, "All right, I'll see to it. It's a bee in my bonnet too."
534479, "I will not. You can talk to them both yourself if you're so assured of your rightness."
534480, ""
534481, "You came on her behalf, I know... What is there for us to talk about then?"
534482, "Tell me, Kaspar, what happened to Maria? "
534483, "I won't. I have a thousand fellows here. Either all of us get it-or none of us does. Take it. Or give it to Olgimsky. He'll tell you all about Sister."
534484, "But where did the bull come from?"
534485, "No. None of us did that. I'd be glad if there were charges! Father and uncle are at the death's door, and I do not want to live under my sister. "
534486, "What can I do to find the guilty party then?"
534487, "Why are you asking me? Bulls are Olgimsky's domain. If the Big one has resigned, ask the Young one. He knows a lot about my sister too."
534488, "Well... I hope no one here is going to be in need of panacea tomorrow."
534489, "I see how unhappy you are. "
534490, "Do you know what happened in the Lot yesterday?"
534491, "Rubbish. Maria is innocent. Moreover, now I understand that she's our only hope. She's the only one who has the courage to keep building the thing that we've set the foundation of. The cowardly and the weak want the reliability, comfort, and confidence of tomorrow. They also want her dead. "
534492, "But what about the Kin? It's not like this can be explained to them. "
534493, "The Kin is gone. For good, sadly. I can already see that Burakh has failed. He's lost everything. So from now on I will serve her who will construct a new miracle instead of the lost one. "
534494, "I promised to give this to you. It's a panacea. "
534495, "I need nothing. I have changed. I'll sell my property. The money will go towards the new construction project. The town has to be rebuilt from scratch."
534496, "So this is how it's going to be for you..."
534497, "'The Accusers'"
534498, "Aglaya does not trust the Kains. She wants to use the little Khan to get to Maria and has asked me to give the panacea to him in exchange for some information that may be used to incriminate his sister."
534499, "Khan says he would have gladly provided information that would have helped to compromise his sister. The problem is, he doesn't have any such information. Quite convincing. It seems Vlad the Younger is the only witness left."
534500, "*** What an idyll! The haters rest their case, the victors adopt the faith of those they prevailed upon. Everything seems to confirm that Maria is pure as the driven snow. I cannot even imagine all the adoration her subjects will shower her with if she becomes the ruler of these places. "
534501, "Maria is getting ready to become a Mistress. Do you know about Mistresses, Bachelor Dankovsky? "
534504, "This changes things."
534505, "No. I'm no good as a courier."
534506, "I have come to you on behalf of Maria Kaina, Clara. "
534507, "Is that all...? Do you even understand that it will be hell! There will be a sorcerer queen, she'll remake everything living for the sake of her ideals and miracles! She'll build a living utopia, an insult to everything that brings men closer to Kingdom Come."
534508, "Do you acknowledge her?"
534509, "Yes, take it! This is for the better. This ring will remind her of where the true power knot actually lies... the knot of live-bearing powers!"
534510, "Oh... So you do know the protocol of inter-Mistress relations."
534511, ""
534512, "I realize what your visit means... "
534513, "I shall speak on Maria's behalf."
534517, "Thank you. Don't be sad. "
534518, "That's just how it goes, Victoria. "
534519, ""
534520, "Above the statues of the Mistresses the air is heavy, as though a thunderstorm was upon us. I could swear I've seen a shade of Scarlet Nina's silhouette and stature rush towards the crypt's gate. She was moving fast but was in no hurry. As though she walked without touching the ground with her feet..."
534521, "You are a very devoted young man. That's a good thing."
534524, ""
534525, "The lady is not to be found anywhere... What could have happened? She couldn't reach Focus yet-it's too early for that. And we would have known of the Mistress's coming immediately... That's why we were assigned here in the first place."
534526, "You think so? Well, keep your watch... "
534529, ""
534531, "I see. Now I understand. "
534532, "No, this is definitely not me... Not your Maria anymore, but neither the Scarlet One yet... Nothing of mine is here. Touch my flesh-and yor hands will only feel air..."
534533, "Farewell, Maria. "
534534, "'Getting Ready for the Coronation'"
534535, "These Kains are a strange lot. The decline of the family is apparent. You can almost see the enormous cloud of foreboding that sprawls over the roof of the Crucible. Still, they seem to rejoice in understanding that their imminent death is nothing compared to the bliss that the birth of a new Mistress will bring. Victor says that the attributes of her power should be collected from Capella... and from the Changeling?"
534536, "Capella has embraced the rule of the future Mistress. As a token of her love and obedience she has offered her mother's necklace to Maria Kaina. "
534537, "Clara has embraced the rule of the new Mistress. As a token of love and obedience she has offered her foster mother's ring to Maria Kaina."
534538, "I can take the relics to the Crucible. Maria is waiting."
534539, "Maria has left the Crucible. But the relics must be given to her in person! Where did she go, I wonder?"
534540, "*** So these are the steps of the Mistress... These are no longer the decisions of a child in exaltation, but strategies worthy of a ruler! I won't hesitate to lead the children out of the Tower at her behest, but the source of the disease must be eradicated first!"
534541, "CLARA'S RING. Seal-ring of the Third Mistress. As a result of some obscure series of events, the ring was given to Clara by Katerina Saburova. It betrothes the Mistress to the Earth."
534542, "CAPELLA'S NECKLACE. Necklace of the Mistress of Light. Before it was passed on to Capella, it was worn by Victoria Olgimskaya. The necklace is carved from the bones of massive animals that no longer live in this land."
534543, "Such as?"
534544, "Just... about his works, mostly. How he breaks the laws instilled by nature itself into the fabrics of the Earth. A clear-cut militant theomachist. Non serviam and all that... A curious one. Such specimens are few and far between in our enlightened times."
534545, "What is that gleam in your eyes all of a sudden?"
534546, "Just... thinking. Thinking of how similar people's fates turn out. We've had so many bright stars of talent rise recently, you know. Almost all of them tried to single-handedly break the laws of history, nature, morality. And all treaded such identical paths!"
534547, "What did you two talk about?"
534548, "Just... asking him about the blueprints. And he keeps saying he doesn't know what those are and doesn't want to know. Sudden memory loss. He's staring at the walls like he used to see through them before. It was a good choice to come here, a good choice indeed. He was right about to remember, but then Maria came..."
534549, "What happened between you?"
534550, "Just... nothing much. Maria burst in, then ran out in tears a minute later. We failed to make peace. It's a pity that everyone sees an enemy in me. Such is the bias against inquisitors. I only wish to do good; not specific, targeted good, like that Clara, but overarching good."
534551, "I sincerely hope so. I believe you. You fight for truth, just like I do."
534552, "Of course, of course. I have great sympathy for this man, Peter Stamatin! He must be taken care of. In any case-thank you. You've accomplished something great... even if it may not look so at first glance. Allow me to thank you for the service. Are you in need of anything?"
534553, "You should try talking to his twin brother to get the full picture."
534554, "I see, Saba."
534555, "If that's the case, then our number is up."
534556, "I won't be staying for long. Who do I have the pleasure of talking to?"
534557, "My name is Kaspar. I am son to Victor and Nina-the youngest of the Kains. Now you name yourself."
534558, "Bachelor Dankovsky."
534559, "The Tower does not abide by the laws of common sense. We have different laws here."
534560, "Perhaps we ought to get acquainted."
534562, "Are you a friend of our family?"
534563, "I am."
534564, "I haven't known your family long enough yet."
534565, "At least that's what your relatives think."
534566, "I've been given your letter, oynon. What does it mean?"
534567, "It's as straightforward as it gets. I've made my choice. I have something to aim for now."
534568, "What was that about 'the cause'?"
534569, "The Kains have conducted a remarkable test-with brilliant results. In short, they've found out how to perform miracles. To breathe soul into buildings and things. They can hold on to soulstates beyond human control. They've conquered death. And that is why I live. We have a lot in common."
534570, "Is it Maria?"
534571, "Is it the Tower?"
534572, "No. Why in the world? It's the utopians' truth. The genius ideas, the will to carry them out, and the space to do so."
534573, "What kind of ideas?"
534574, "Well... I wish you luck. You've given me food for thought."
534575, "I thought you were a less passionate person, oynon."
534576, "Why these particular people?"
534577, "You wrote to me, and nothing spoken can disavow that..."
534578, "So what? I wanted you to have one more chance. An option to make a free choice."
534579, "You're lying to yourself. I know your kind of possession."
534580, "I believe you. Perhaps I'll give some panacea to your Bound."
534581, "He who has ears, let him hear nothing. He who has eyes, let him see nothing. Have I really not done enough miracles recently? Do I really need to prove myself to you? As you wish. Have if your way. I seek to gain no profit from you."
534582, "...You do. Thanks."
534583, "No you don't. But I'm not in the mood to argue."
534584, "What have you done, you dimwits..."
534585, "Get lost, and never set foot here again!"
534586, "Where's the patrol? Have you murdered them too? "
534587, "I know. Stand your guard."
534588, "I only need to speak to them. Through the door maybe."
534589, "The infected is unconscious. The development of the disease is uneven, sure, and this person can resist it longer than a commoner would, but there'll be no talking. Unless you offer them a good antibiotic. That could bring them back to life for a while."
534590, "Yes... That is an option, even though it's temporary."
534591, "You had an opportunity to stop this."
534592, "So what? Nothing can be changed now."
534593, "I don't want to talk to you, Executor."
534594, "Perhaps, not all is lost. Everybody thought Simon was dead."
534595, "But the dead is not Simon, and neither are you a Kain. You do not know how to connect spirit with matter. Leave. The dead belong to the earth."
534596, "...."
534597, "Stand your guard."
534598, "Why don't you kill him?"
534599, "He is very strong, yes, strong. No soldier by trade, but a mighty fighter still. He builds houses. He's very fierce, yes, fierce. None of the odonghe could avenge our seduced sisters, our bribed brothers. We tried to fight back, but he's killed everyone who went against him."
534600, "Some builder he is..."
534601, "What sisters do you speak of?"
534602, "Herb Brides dance to please him when they should be pleasing the Earth. They pleasure outsiders and abandon themselves to vice. He only does this for his own amusement. The elder odonghe will be forever thankful to you if you kill him."
534603, "I'm not a thug for hire."
534604, "We'll see."
534605, "Does anyone in the town buy twyre?"
534606, "There is a den in Earth, yes, a den where people drink liquid twyrine... A terrible man spends his days there, spends his nights, seduces the children of Boddho into treachery, curse him. It was he who made us kill our odonghe brothers, the brothers that have given away our secrets."
534607, "Why don't you kill him?"
534608, "He is very strong, yes, strong. No soldier by trade, but a mighty fighter still. He builds houses. He's very fierce, yes, fierce. None of the odonghe could avenge our seduced sisters, our bribed brothers. We tried to fight back, but he's killed everyone who went against him."
534609, "Some builder he is..."
534610, "What sisters do you speak of?"
534611, "Herb Brides dance to please him when they should be pleasing the Earth. They pleasure outsiders and abandon themselves to vice. He only does this for his own amusement. The elder odonghe will be forever thankful to you if you kill him."
534612, "I'm not a thug for hire."
534613, "We'll see."
534614, "Is that so..."
534615, "Does anyone in the town buy twyre?"
534616, "There is a den in Earth, yes, a den where people drink liquid twyrine... A terrible man spends his days there, spends his nights, seduces the children of Boddho into treachery, curse him. It was he who made us kill our odonghe brothers, the brothers that have given away our secrets."
534617, "Why don't you kill him?"
534618, "He is very strong, yes, strong. No soldier by trade, but a mighty fighter still. He builds houses. He's very fierce, yes, fierce. None of the odonghe could avenge our seduced sisters, our bribed brothers. We tried to fight back, but he's killed everyone who went against him."
534619, "Some builder he is..."
534620, "What sisters do you speak of?"
534621, "Herb Brides dance to please him when they should be pleasing the Earth. They pleasure outsiders and abandon themselves to vice. He only does this for his own amusement. The elder odonghe will be forever thankful to you if you kill him."
534622, "I'm not a thug for hire."
534623, "We'll see."
534624, "Is that so..."
535105, "Your eyes are positively turning green-and they used to be brown."
535106, "Oh! And so the former rebel pledges allegiance!"
535107, "Very little time has passed, but I feel hungry and exhausted again..."
535108, "Since you've decided to fight death, you will have to be very careful. It's September. You will be dying with every breath of our air."
535109, "We are all dying with every second of our life. It's exactly this annoying phenomenon that I have challenged. But since you've heard of Thanatica's achievements, I'm not going to waste your time monologuing."
535110, "You got me wrong. You will be dying here much faster than in the Capital. Your body is wasting away just as fast as a boat sinks with its hold full of water. Breathe in this air. Can you feel it?"
535111, "But why?"
535112, "This Steppe is full of various herbs. They fill the air with dizzying vapours. White whip, twyre, and swevery are dangerous in August and September, when herbs surrender their juices to the sun. People tend to get headaches this time of year. Heart sufferers lie in bed with pains. My heart aches too..."
535113, "How do you people live here?"
535114, "Twyre is a rare herb, so usually it's bearable. But this year it's unbelievably plentiful! The elderly say that this is phenomenal, nothing like this has happened before. They think it's a bad omen. Well, I don't believe that, but the air is droning! Can't you feel it? Don't you feel dizzy?"
535115, "Yes, the air is heavy."
535116, "You need to sleep often. Never go hungry. Drink more water. You need to look after yourself properly! If you feel sick, forget everything else and get some rest. Otherwise you may die of a heart attack or bleeding. Be careful, all right?"
535117, "Both my heart and mind are strong enough."
535118, "Not at all. My mind is quite prosaic. Yet your arrival has gone to my head so much that I'm longing for poetry now... but I speak of the simplest, corporeal things. I'm simply worried about your health."
535119, "Am I in danger?"
535120, "What am I supposed to do? Not breathe your air? Should I have stocked up on the air from the Capital?"
535121, "The more I think and do, the faster I die? That's symbolism if I ever saw it."
535122, "You have a poetic mind."
535123, "I am a doctor. I know how to take care of myself."
535124, "What does September have to do with it?"
535125, "I've set up a whole laboratory upstairs. I hope that's fine with you? I understand that it can be rather annoying..."
535126, "It's nothing. Nothing at all. In any case, I won't be staying here much longer..."
535127, "What is that supposed to mean?"
535128, "Do you know why our Cathedral remains empty?"
535129, "No, why?"
535130, "It isn't a Cathedral, actually. It was supposed to become a Cathedral, yet for some reason it didn't. Sometimes I feel sad for it."
535131, "Sad? Seriously?"
535132, "I could have been living next to a place where sacrament is performed daily..."
535133, "Anyway, I have to go."
535134, "Stop it! There's no need to be so pessimistic. In the days of old it was common knowledge that plague strikes the hopeless first."
535135, "I have my own plans for this Cathedral. It's soon destined to become a temple of hope and fear. I don't think there is a different option..."
535136, "Cheer up, will you? Stop being depressed. If nothing else works, try to get some sleep or get drunk at least."
535137, "Cathedrals are left empty when those who believe in everlasting life go extinct."
535138, "You must be very clever..."
535139, "Very much so. That's why I'm here."
535140, "I'm slightly above average at best. So what about the Cathedral?"
535141, "Yes, I think I've seen this kind of masks somewhere."
535143, "Do you know that Simon was murdered?"
535144, "Yes, they're talking about this on every corner already. It boggles my mind... It's terrible, isn't it?"
535145, "Georgiy bid me to find the murderer. He lauded my analytic abilities..."
535146, "Did you agree?"
535147, "Yes. Without hesitation."
535148, "Why?"
535149, "I wonder who could profit from his death. He was killed just a few hours before my arrival. A peculiar coincidence, wouldn't you agree?"
535150, "Oh! Our Masks staged a mime performance about this not so long ago! 'The Grim Murder of the Sorcerer King Kuron.' Mark promised that they'd make a puppet-show interpretation of the same play today. Now they will surely cancel the performance and the puppet-show though..."
535151, "There are mime performances in your town? You must be joking..."
535152, "I did... All my hopes went down the chute in a single moment... Oh the vility!"
535153, "Are you going to go back to the Capital?"
535154, "I'm going to stay here for a while. Georgiy has wounded my pride. I gave him hope. He expects me to find the killer."
535155, "Stay! You can live at my place... the Stamatin brothers came from the Capital in their day too. The are geniuses, just like you, but they've been living here for ten years now-having no plans to leave."
535156, "There is only disgrace for me in the Capital. If they shut down the laboratory, I will most likely have to blow my brains out."
535157, "Do you have any theories? Who could have killed an immortal man?"
535158, "Staggering, prophetic performances! They predict fates. Only the most desperate come to see them. The whole town used to, but when people found out how it ends, the demand dwindled. Now the Theatre stands empty in the evenings."
535159, "I don't understand. How does it end? Does someone get killed?"
535160, "Two ritual Masks pick a volunteer from the crowd. Mark looks at his hands, then shows them to the Masks. They improvise. Without a word they play out either the nearest future or the whole life of the person-depending on the price. And it always comes true! Can you imagine?"
535161, "Where is this Theatre?"
535162, "On Spin-a-Yarn Square, in the Marrow. The very essence and heart of the town, the central district. But the Theatre is closed now. It will only open in the evening. And even then... I don't know... after everything that transpired today... I'm afraid they might accuse poor Mark."
535163, "I'll check on him. We'll figure that artist out."
535164, "Poor Mark, a wonderful magician that he is, will wiggle his way out somehow."
535165, "Indeed, few people would want to know their fate, even if given the chance. If the prophecies were true, of course."
535166, "Who is Mark?"
535167, "Oh! Mark is a wonderful puppet-master. He can do anything, he can perform all sorts of tricks, he can swallow swords and read the future in the cards! And he also directs the mime performances."
535168, "What is that?"
535169, "How do you know?"
535170, "I'm an inquisitor. Talking to such types is part of the job description. I serve the law."
535171, "What did you two talk about?"
535172, "Clara? Have you met with her as well?"
535173, "Why, of course... We spoke on this exact topic... I hope to convince the child of some self-evident truths. She's another vivid and interesting character in this! A medieval type, passionate, self-contradictory! It's as if she's not of our time... But that's just minutiae."
535174, "Actually, I've come to inform you that they're waiting for you at the Cathedral. There's already a throng of terrified petitioners gathered..."
535175, "Thank you. Hopefully, I won't disappoint you."
535176, "And now it's best that you leave. I'll take care of Peter."
535177, "I hope so too,"
535178, "Why? What kind of suicidal gesture is that?"
535179, "The Termitary is opened. What do you want of me? I've told you multiple times-the earth is sacred for these Steppe cannibals! You can't just bury bodies in it. They believe only holy men deserve such high honor."
535180, "And what does that have to do with you? You could pass the buck to the Inquisitor and me. We would think of something to say."
535181, "To whom? The crowd? Try to explain anything to them and I'll have a nice look at you becoming a martyr. From a safe distance, preferably. I could give the orders to loyal patrolmen secretly while they all were locked up, but now... Ah, what could you understand!"
535182, "What, is digging also only restricted to butchers?"
535183, "Yes! Exactly! Why do you think Grace, this tiny little girl, manages the town cemetery? You think we don't have any undertakers? It's her position by right! By inheritance! The caretakers were poisoned by twyre and couldn't give birth to a successor!"
535184, "What a... You could have explained it! That the situation is critical!"
535185, "Very well. I see your point. Goodbye."
535186, "And who did you put in charge of the cremations?"
535187, "Do I answer to you now?"
535188, "Yes. I am still in charge. Now more than ever."
535189, "You are wrong. I know him very well. I can't imagine a more moronic appointment."
535190, "From your point of view. From mine it looks completely different. There is a cast-iron logic behind this decision."
535191, "Revoke your decision! Choose someone else!"
535192, "Ah...! Do whatever you like..."
535193, "Wow... now I'm intrigued. Someone else will explain it, I guess, if not you."
535194, "How in the world is she 'your woman'?"
535195, "Where's Eva? Is she alive? "
535196, "No, I'm pretty certain she is dead by now. There was a mistake, it seems. A terrible mistake... Although there was a reason for us to come here too... Oh, to hell with all this!"
535197, "A mistake? Tell me. "
535198, "I received a farewell letter from Eva informing me that she was planning to take her own life at the Cathedral. Convinced that a miracle would be there for her, she wanted to jump from the balustrade and fly... an insane, rambling letter, apparently written by an already deranged person."
535199, "Why in the world didn't you ask her who they were referring to?"
535200, "Indeed. Why did we bother in the first place..."
535201, "I think I know why she's done it."
535202, "No. It's I who am an idiot."
535203, "Plague... and to think that all those years we were expecting an earthquake..."
535204, "Tell me more."
535205, "People were lying in rows, wrapped in wet sheets, like a large pauper family in their shared bed. One of corpses began to shift, freeing itself from the sheet and reaching its familiar arms out to me... Oh, but no; I will not join that row of corpses! I shall live."
535206, "Of course you're going to live."
535207, "Not for myself! For all that my family's labours and vision have built. This plague... If my mother had heard its call from the Steppe, she would have soared up, her back arched proudly, grabbing fire from the sky even though it may burn her white hands, and scorched the contagion out. "
535208, "We'll nip it in the bud."
535209, "A pity I'm unlikely to ever see that."
535210, "No need to start your fires before you've caught the witch."
535211, "Live? Why? What is your purpose?"
535212, "Your dream won't come true. You'll see for yourself."
535213, "A fragment? Or just a figment of your all-too-vivid imagination? The odorous spice air here makes you people sleep several times a day. Does that always bring nightmares?"
535214, "Life doesn't cease at night. Different sorts of people come out then-either too monstrous or too fragile for daylight. The darkness allows the opposites to pass each other by without stepping on anyone's toes."
535215, "Monstrous in appearance or in their actions?"
535216, "Grief's daredevil thugs. Soul-and-a-Halves and Dogheads, the ruthless children."
535217, "That's some diverse fauna you have around here."
535218, "Is it not the same in the Capital? Be careful, Bachelor. You need to keep yourself alive to face the deadliest of foes."
535219, "I know that."
535220, "So walking at night unarmed would be unwise, right?"
535221, "At night you can kill with impunity. You can't be held accountable for self-defence...or responsible for attacking someone with deadly force if you do it at night."
535222, "I'll keep that in mind."
535223, "Who are those fragile creatures?"
535224, "Myself, for instance. Or you. Children playing, Signs flirting... Night is prettier than day. There's a legend that a glimmering pale creature walks across Earth at night."
535225, "A local legend? Is that the shabnak everyone's talking about?"
535226, "Some of the children were trying to track it-ask them. Sticky is their leader. He's been snooping around every place he can squeeze into."
535227, "Very well, I'll ask Sticky."
535228, "So who were you calling monstrous then?"
535229, "*** Clara refused to tell me how her story ends."
535230, ""
535231, "I would have no future if not for you. The cause that I serve could fail without me. Thank you."
535232, "So what kind of future is destined for you?"
535233, "You are nothing. You're just unaware of this yet. "
535234, ""
535238, ""
535242, ""
535243, "Will you stay with us?"
535244, "What for?"
535247, ""
535248, "What would we do without your help! That means you'll be just like your father by the time we grow up..."
535249, "What are you planning to do with your life?"
535252, ""
535253, "Capella and I owe you so much. I am only alive because of you, aren't I?"
535254, "Tell me, why does Capella need you?"
535257, ""
535258, "I would not have lived to see today if not for you. Now, if my design works, I will be able to revive the town. I am grateful to you, Warden. I'll never forget it."
535259, "What is your plan?"
535262, ""
535263, "I'm alive and it's you who made it so! Thank you, thank you! Does that mean you'll be helping me from now on?"
535264, "Who told you that?"
535267, ""
535268, "You helped us. Thank you for your saving my life. I will be able to put it to good use now that I'm leaving Tower."
535269, "And how are you going to use it?"
535277, "The town will be rebuilt. We will transfer it to the other side of the river. The land is clean there. Nobody will disturb us. The Polyhedron will become the foundation of a new settlement-just like the Abattoir had become one for the doomed settlement. And a new era will set in. "
535278, "I'm afraid this time will never come. "
535279, "I hope you succeed."
535280, "Live. Do what you must."
535281, "We are too few now. I won't succeed by myself of course... Every person counts. Do you know how many of us have survived?"
535282, "I don't know. At least you won't die...And I don't care about the rest."
535283, "My mission here is not yet complete. There will be enough of you."
535284, "If you didn't take care of me, who would breathe life into our town again? I will have so many things to do in five or ten years... Thank you, thank you!"
535285, "You think this town is still able to take a new lease of life?"
535286, "Definitely. It won't be easy, of course. But life has to be fought for, otherwise it's not real. Do not tear off the umbilical cord that has been feeding all of us since the beginning of time; these things are already going extinct almost everywhere."
535287, "Is it really worth the effort to do your best for the sake of such a wretched place?"
535288, "And what about my friends? I won't be able to do anything without them. Are they alive? Is it possible to visit them already?"
535289, "I don't know. I wanted to take care only of you."
535290, "Not yet. I'm not done yet."
535291, "Indeed. At least it's still alive here. You still do remember your origins."
535292, "No need to thank me. I just suddenly felt so sorry for you."
535293, "Live. Do what you must."
535294, "Thank you. I need to live a little longer-there's one more thing that has to be done. My death will not be purposeless now."
535295, "What kind of thing?"
535296, "I am to perform the most precious feat of all, the feat of self-sacrifice. I will do what Simon has done-every single particle of my body and soul will become lifebearing, bursting with life and granting it to others. There will be no cannon fire. The town will continue to grow. The thread to the future will stretch from the very dawn of time."
535297, "But you won't last long. You won't be enough. Consider Simon's fate!"
535298, "We are too few now. But if there's at least a dozen of us, it will be enough for the town to expand further and beyond. Hopefully, the place where daydreams are captured and fulfilled will live to see two hundred years more. And how many of those like me have survived?"
535299, "I don't care. I wanted to save your life not for the sake of future sacrifices."
535300, "There'll be more of them."
535301, "Do you really believe that it can be done?"
535302, "There is no death."
535303, "Live. Do what you must."
535304, "Don't mention it."
535305, "The outcast children who have left the Polyhedron will establish a new town. They will become new Mistresses and rulers; they will lay down a new triangle of powers and beginnings. This time, it will stand firmly on its base rather than trying to balance on one of the vertices."
535306, "Why did you choose the outcasts?"
535307, "It's not a cause, it's an effect. They have left the Polyhedron because their fate lies elsewhere. Prisoners of dreams can build, but they cannot rule. Moreover, you have to be resolute, mature, and independent to break free from childhood. Only the most outstanding children can do it."
535308, "I've heard you wanted to found a new religion?"
535309, "I don't. You still fail to grasp who Mistresses are. So do the children-which is why they keep talking about a religion. Can religion be invented by a man? It's not a game."
535310, "Hardly. I want to leave this place."
535311, "Yes. It's not a game."
535312, "Tell me, will you stay with us? Will you rule the Kin like your father was supposed to?"
535313, "You are being insincere. I know more about pagan beliefs than you."
535314, "Yes. I'll stay with you."
535315, "You can leave with Aglaya, but what are you to the outer world? Am unlikable savage with backwards ideas, a futureless back countryman, an opportunist with a bloody past. When the first infatuation fades out, Aglaya will turn her back on you. You've been only brought together by the insanity of what was happening here. You should stay with us. Lead the Kin. Take care of your people. You know the lines."
535316, "You are right. I know the lines."
535317, "I hope you're wrong this time, little Mistress."
535318, "What 'triangle of powers and beginnings'?"
535319, "The Earth begot the town; the town begot the Tower; the tower begot the plague and cleansed the Earth. The Bachelor is wrong; to overcome nonexistence, it's not enough to just kill death. You also have to fill the void. Only the Town can overcome Chaos."
535320, "Now I see."
535321, "Why are you calling them outcasts? Didn't they leave Tower on their own?"
535322, "You are speaking like an adult man."
535323, "I will rule the town-in the same fashion that my father used to when my mother was alive and glimmering. It's hard to be in control if your wife is a Mistress. I'll have to think about how to build a world for her and protect everything she will breathe life into. It won't be easy. I will start with training an army."
535324, "Why are you leaving the place?"
535325, "Are you at least happy that you've made peace?"
535326, "Not entirely. But the confrontation of the two corners has turned into an enmity, and our union will put an end to that. Capella will establish a new triangle. I don't know yet what powers will become its corners. One of them will be us. Neither do I know what will come from this. Nevertheless, childhood is over. It's a shame."
535327, "Big Sister is driving me away. I cannot fight her, neither can I disobey her. She is becoming the Dark Mistress, the Chariot of Night. Perhaps she already has. We'll know for sure tonight after star-rise."
535328, "Why is  she driving you away?"
535329, "So you've agreed to side with Olgimskaya to get back at her?"
535330, "That's one of the reasons, yes. But spitefulness is a disgraceful feeling. In reality I am afraid of my sister. She will grow stronger than Mother, who used to be held back by Father. This is why her power had brought more good than evil. And Victoria Sr., Ursa Major, was also alive back then. Who is to hold Maria back now?"
535331, "Will the Kains and the Olgimskys make peace?"
535332, "Why?"
535333, "The Tower used to be able to bring dreams to life and preserve them. It was a Rose. Sister said it's high time the Rose becomes a Chalice. It will turn from a head into a womb, a foundation of a new world. I'll have no part of it. The children are leaving. Right now."
535334, "She wants memory and the thoughts of the heroic past to inhabit the Tower instead of childhood and the dreams of future. She needs to light up a fire here. To make a furnace where she would forge a new and wonderful world."
535335, "Hmm... Setting fire to this place doesn't seem like a good idea..."
535336, "I see."
535337, "A stem this thin won't be a good foundation for the new world..."
535338, "I will bring the Tower down. That's how I'll produce precious blood from below the ground."
535339, "I will."
535340, "Is that enough?"
535341, "No. I had nothing to do with it."
535342, "Indeed."
535343, "I will replace the second Mistress. That means... Capella thinks I'll manage to. She says I'm shining bright-but unlike hers, my glimmer isn't thick, but rather transparent and very pale."
535344, "What for?"
535345, "Each of us will tug the power in our own direction: she'll tug a bit upwards, and I'll tug downwards. We'll tune life together, opposing each other. Like Nina and Victoria before, but not for real. Moreover, I'll help her make the lines into a circle. At least that's my understanding."
535346, "Makes sense."
535347, "Will Capella be the first?"
535348, "Yes. I'll have to stand in contrast to her. She feels the living and I feel the dead; she knows how to take care of the living, knows what they need. I can listen to the dead and know how they turn into grass to face the sun and why each twyre blade is different... And there you go."
535349, "Are these her words? You can't be making this up, can you...?"
535350, "These are Capella's words. She explained all this to me. But I can also feel that it's true."
535351, "What else did she tell you?"
535352, "I see."
535353, "I hope you'll manage."
535354, "Hardly, Mother. You will manage on your own just fine."
535355, "Capella did. You'll become the Foreman and the most important person in the Kin now. Everyone will follow your words like they did with Dad. And I'll always be at your side so that you know that we're all together and that the Kin loves you. That's what she promised me!"
535356, "Why are you so happy? You were the only one they listened to before. What do you think happens now?"
535357, "She couldn't have promised something like that!"
535358, "I'll step aside a bit, but I'll help you and connect you with everybody. I won't bother the new Mistresses even though I really want to... It's all Capella's design-even though I don't really get it."
535359, "So what! She said you'll most likely agree because that's how your lines are. You're in charge of us all, we are all your responsibility. And it's the same then! You and I need to rebuild the Kin. They'll pine away without me."
535360, "We'll see."
535361, "So you'll also become a Mistress?"
535362, "Is it she who told you all this?"
535363, "It will only happen in many years. You'll change a lot by then."
535364, "Yes. She also said there'll be four nodes instead of three from now on. The fourth one is me! Standing aside. A bit. Well, I mean, there always must have been four nodes, but no one noticed that before. I think things will be better now than they used to be."
535365, "I hope so."
535366, "I doubt that."
535367, "Yes. I'll stay here and won't ever leave this place."
535368, "No. There's nothing for me here anymore."
535369, "A lot of things will change. I will actually stop living here. I'll have my own house."
535370, "A house?"
535371, "The Rod. I am destined to become the Mistress of the Earth. Katerina has failed. And I won't. That's what Capella says."
535372, "Why do you think you'll succeed where Katerina has failed?"
535373, "Capella knows that for sure. She can see the future. In ten years I'll become a tall and slender beauty. I'll have white skin and dark ankle-long hair. Or even longer. I will speak with the Earth. Perhaps even command it."
535374, "I'd stay here just to see it..."
535375, "It's high time."
535376, "...Whoa."
535377, "I wish you good luck, Murky. Take care of yourself."
535378, "Don't worry. There's nothing for us to fight over."
535381, "I'm not sure yet. The balance is constantly shifting. The disposition of forces will be different. It won't be like the previous standoff between the Termites and the Utopians. Capella has already considered everything. It's good that she's tamed Khan. We are sick and tired of utopias. Let's build a new world, a better one!"
535382, "I can already see the seeds of future rebellion in you. It's you who'll become the new utopian, Notkin."
535383, "I hope you won't forget my role in establishing the new disposition."
535384, "Are you already thinking about ousting me from power? Ain't you a quick lad..."
535385, "I will be the axis for the wheel to spin around. A future ruler with a new sign. I trust Capella."
535386, "A new sign? What do you mean?"
535387, "I have already become what my father was."
535388, "When you come of age, I'll only be in my forties!"
535389, "The Kain-Olgimsky-Saburov triangle is over. There are no more Termites, Utopians, or Humbles. The three powers are gone almost without a trace now; they're nothing but memories now. We need new forces and new signs. The old rulers are gone-except for you. Will you protect our little town until we come of age?"
535390, "What do you stand for?"
535391, "I don't know yet... We didn't have enough time to talk. But I will become a builder to direct Khan's and Notkins ardour. That's what Capella has seen. I wonder which of the two Mistresses is supposed to be paired with me? Grace or Murky... oh my sides. They're both very nice, but also not much to look at. Are you sure they're alive?"
535392, "Why would you hold Khan and Notkin back?"
535393, "...I'll protect it after you come of age too. Don't get ahead of yourself."
535394, "We'll make a new triangle, duh! This tug of war will never end, whether we want it or not. And I have a hunch that they'll grow to become commanders and conquerors like Block and Shoin. But I'm already thinking as to what to counter those two war dogs with."
535395, "Good."
535396, "Don't worry. They'll grow to be pretty."
535397, "I am. I'm taking care of both of them."
535398, "Yeah... If the girl is right about you, I'm very curious as to how it'll all turn out."
535399, "I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Khan is the one I'm really after. Ooh, that's the guy I'll have to meet head on! Khan will grow to inspire true terror. Has he really abandoned the ways of his family? Who could have thought-Nina's son switching faith... What does he believe in now, by the way?"
535400, "Let's start with you. What are you standing up for?"
535401, "I don't know. Ask Capella."

Before he attends the final Council in the Cathedral, he will have to make sure that his Bound are alive. They are: Georgiy, Victor, and Maria Kaina, as well as Peter and Andrey Stamatin."
535404, "Only the Changeling will be able to explain the advantages of her paradoxical solution to the Chess Queens. Before she attends the final Council in the Cathedral, she will want to make sure that her Bound are alive. They are: Bad Grief, Rubin, Aspity, Anna, Yulia, Lara, Alexander, and Katerina."
535405, "The Bound of the Bachelor are alive and well. May he be comforted by that. He should have enough time to prepare his argument for the proceedings."

535411, "We've been to a funeral. We've just come back from a cemetery, actually."
535412, "Oh, I see... So who died on you?"
535413, "We won't tell you. In fact, it's all just fantasies anyway. No one's died! It just doesn't work like this. There's no death, get it?"
535414, "But why did you need dolls? Couldn't you have played without us?"
535415, "Your game works exactly like this."

535423, "I really don't."
535424, "Do you think this is funny?"
535425, "Where is his lair?"

535428, "The machine? What machine?"
535429, "...You are positively trying to drive me mad... Can't you see I'm in pain... What machine are you talking about...? I don't know anything about machines..."

535486, "Make way. "
535487, "They've already begun. What are you waiting for? Do you want to make the optimal impression barging in?"

535492, "Exactly! Oh you sly devil! Thinking on your feet, aren't you? You're called a hero of the intellectual type for a reason, I see!"

535516, "No matter how hard you struggle, an Inquisitor will always find a way to trick you, and there's nothing to be done about it. An Inquisitor can always use you in their interests so that you won't even notice it. And that's exactly what is going to happen to us all today."
535517, "Why is the Inquisitor so dangerous to you, Commander?"
535518, "Officially I don't have the right to fire unless either of you provides me with a detailed report on the hazard situation. I hope you can appreciate the restriction it applies to my freedom..."
535519, "So what? "
535520, "I suspect that the young fox has concealed her major arguments, waiting to reveal them at the last minute. She will most likely do it in such a fashion that I'll have no out and won't be able to open fire. I'm not barbarous. I have no intention to kill civilians unless there are no other options."
535521, "I will come to the Cathedral."
535522, "That is good to hear."
535523, "I've heard that one before-and I've already given an answer. I will do as my conscience tells me to. If this aligns with someone else's schemes, so be it."

535525, "What happens if I don't come to the Cathedral?"
535526, "The Inquisitor and I will have a conflict. I don't think anything good will come of it. I am so wary of her that I will have to break my instructions, I'm afraid. I'll risk falling into disgrace-facing a court martial even."
535527, "I can relate to you very well. "
535528, "It is time. Go. "
535529, "Yes, I'm going. "

535570, "Then tell me how you would do this."

Once again, the town will become the same backwater hole it was before. The hippocratic oath enjoins us to preserve the life of a genius by means of curative lobotomy. Vigorous applause."
535684, "Clara will come to the Cathedral. If I will let her make the ultimate decision, she will force the Commander to withdraw his troops and the current situation will remain unchanged. Yet, might a refusal to interfere be seen as a decision in itself? In this case, the town will remain a machine of death, no matter how pretty."
535685, "Fine. Let the Town remain. Let the broken circles come whole, let the interrupted processes resume. The wisdom of life is superior to that of people, so life should be allowed to proceed in its due course.  /n/nThe Utopia is doomed. Feeble men should not be tempted with miracles. There is no point to forcibly preserve something whose very idea is destroyed by any kind of coercion. The Tower, the reason and the outset of the calamity, will be demolished."
535686, "Let the Tower remain; whatever the cost. Nothing like it will ever be built again. It is not a mere a building, but a symbol. It allows us a hope of a possibility that some false-truths of our ill-fated epoch might be overthrown./n/nIt is a delicate fortress that holds veritable proof that however well-established our notions of possibility are, they still fail to account for what may or may not exist. This is the bastion I am willing to fight for./n/nAs for the Powers That Be, they are going to regret their hypocrisy. They were so determined to force me to observe the promise I gave not to disappoint. The town they are so fond of will be reduced to rubble. This I have spoken."
535687, "The Polyhedron will not survive without the Town. If the children no longer come to play inside its walls, then it will expire. Its light will snuff out if the simple-minded townsfolk no longer see it as a source of illumination; a miracle; a door to the other world./n/nTrue, the town is hardly more than a machine, pumping death from the very bowels of hell. This, however, is the only town where the Polyhedron could possibly exist. Let things remain as they are. The constant threat of pandemic is a fair price to pay for the chance of something like this Tower to appear."

535699, "Yes, I was soon notified of your intercession. I'm ashamed to admit that I saw an obvious omen in it. I see omens in everything these days, old boy. And so I thought that I was burying myself prematurely; there must be something else for me to do. A calling. And it was a happy thought."
535700, "And so you imbibed some more?"
535701, "And so I indulged in imbibing, how could I not? But this time there was a purpose. You see, I've witnessed the clear image of my future creation at the bottom of the bottle I'm so fond of. Have you seen the chalice on the opposite side of the river? The one that overcomes gravity and captures dreams?"
535702, "I have."
535703, "Soon I shall erect a new chalice-a chalice to surpass the present one many times over. Twyrine sap has taught me to look at the three common dimensions from a different angle. It turns the recipient inside out, playing with density and transparency variations... Do you understand? "
535704, "Not a single word you're saying."
535705, "Oh, it doesn't matter at all! But when I had a complete image in my head-a calculation; a design; a blueprint; a scheme, you know?-I raised my eyes and saw the Angel of Punishment upon me. Her gaze has burned me through, her smile turning my dreams to naught."
535706, "These angels always accompany the type of creativity that looks for inspiration at the bottom of a bottle."
535707, "And she said, 'I know who you are. You are Peter. Upon this stone you have erected that which should never be.' And then she leaned over to me, her carmine lips parted, and her kiss-her kiss would have drained my dream from me forever, I know it! For it was the Angel of Doubt! A demonic temptress of hesitation..."
535708, "Please get to the point."
535709, "But then I heard a waft of a familiar power. Maria stormed in and fought the demon! Their naked bodies intertwined... their white hands tearing at each other's throats, their slender tongues stinging one another... And then I fainted. And now-here you are..."
535710, "What did the demon look like? "
535711, "She had a terrible and powerful presence, like Nina used to... The ceiling here is low, but still I could see a silhouette above her mortal coil, its head blending into heavens. She... hey, here she is! Look, she's still here-devouring my designs, licking them away line by line!"
535712, "And here we go. Delirium tremens. "
535713, "But I've told you that you're safe, haven't I? The Inquisitor guarantees you protection from Saburov. "
535714, "It seems to operate under a 'tell, don't show' principle."
535715, "Well... More or less."
535716, "I see. Did you at least give her a good pinch?"
535717, "Does Saburov really want you dead?"
535718, "Why did you give the cloaks away? They offer decent protection... "
535719, "I don't care anymore... It happens sooner or it happens later-what's the difference? Even if I put ten cloaks on... cloaks don't help the people that she's already set her eyes upon. I know this for a proven fact."
535720, "Hey, get yourself together! You can't give up without a fight! "
535721, "No. You're seeing double."
535757, "What are you up to, Maria?"
535758, "She wants to reconcile with you. "
535759, "She hates me for my mother's magical power. I know what she wants-she wants to see if I resemble my mother or not... oh, she won't leave me alive! Especially now that mother's many-coloured power has begun to awaken inside me... She'll know, she'll feel it!"
535760, "She says that she had frightened you somehow when you were a child. It has to pass if you give her a chance."
535761, "No, I do not think so... Consider it a whim-but I'm incapable of doubting my premonitions... else too many people will suffer. It may be a superstition, I may be imagining all this, but I won't let her in! Ever!"
535762, "You are holding a key-as if you were about to leave. Where to?"
535763, "Oh no, I wasn't planning on going anywhere. And who are you to forbid me anyway...?"
535764, "It seems like your mother's modus operandi must have led her to having plenty of haters."
535765, "What do you know about it? Have you ever seen her, at least once in your life? How can you judge... "
535766, "Come now, I didn't want to offend you... Are those tears in your eyes?"
535767, "Come now, it was merely a hallucination. "
535770, "What if you manage to influence her so much that the Inquisitor starts acting in our favour?"
535771, "Well, as you wish. I won't interfere with your family business."
535772, "You're a bad liar. I think I'm going to tell your father about that."
535773, "Oh no! Please don't tell Dad. He must not be disturbed now... don't go there! He must not get distracted... today is memory day."
535774, "I am Bachelor Dankovsky, and you are not going anywhere."
535775, "You've piqued my curiosity. "
535776, "She doesn't have to. One look at these chambers, and she realized everything. Oh, what have you done! Now she knows all about Peter. Good thing he's unconscious... but it won't last long. We need to call for help."
535777, "I already regret my choice. Forgive me. "
535778, "A rare confession for a girl."
535779, "If you want to make up for it-take her away from there. Now! I can't do it myself... I wanted to call someone for help so that they would distract her with troubling news or something..."
535780, "Okay, I'll do it. Just don't cry. Oh my God... "
535781, "I wanted to reconcile you two."
535782, "Why did you leave them? "
535783, "She is much stronger than me... She defeated me. I'm not a Mistress yet after all, and  I'm weaker than ever now that I'm expecting... I'm gaping open, turned inside out... It only takes a single touch to cause me pain..."
535784, "What can I do for you? "
535785, "Come now, calm down... I'm sorry."
535786, "I'll call for you when I need you."
535787, "My name is Ayan. I am a dancer, the daughter of Hook the herdsman from the Boissa kin. I'm even related to the Oyuns menkhu kin through my father's sister. Andrey sent me here to look after the house and serve you."
535788, "All right. Stay. A swift and sharp maid would be useful to me."
535789, "How nice of him..."
535790, "I want to get some sleep."
535791, "Your master? Who's that?"
535798, "Where is Eva?"
535799, "Are you alone? Is your woman not here?"
535800, "Evidently."
535801, "Hurry up and go to Andrey then. He needs your help to make her come back, to take her away from the Worms. She went to them of her own accord, but he said that was because she'd gone mad."
535802, "So he knows where Eva is? I need to know what he wanted you to tell me-and I need to know the exact words!"
535803, "Don't be angry with me, oynon... Andrey told me to make a dash for the oynon's place as quickly as I could to check if his woman was there. If I found her, I was to tell her that he was coming and make sure she doesn't harm herself. If I do not find her but find the oynon, he told me to fetch you. He said you two would have to face trouble."
535804, "I don't understand a thing!"
535805, "Neither do I. But Andrey does. Help him, so that he doesn't get himself killed... He is unarmed. He gave his weapon to the Changeling. Then he told me to run here, run as fast as I could. And so I did, like a leaf on the wind, like the wind itself-that's how fast I was!"
535806, "The Worms? What do the Worms have to do with it?"
535807, "Haruspex Burakh opened their bride up. Now the earth refuses to grant them herbs. They demanded a woman that has the gift of warmth. If she doesn't lure in herbs for them either, they'll feed her to the earth to stop this plague."
535808, "And what does that have to do with Eva?"
535809, "Haruspex Burakh may have told her about it. He was looking for a woman that has the gift of warmth, one he wouldn't mind giving away. But I've never seen your woman, so I can't say anything for certain."
535810, "Why do you insist on spewing nonsense then if you have no idea what you're even talking about? And what does Eva have to do with the Worms?!"
535811, "You are not getting away with this one... my dear colleague."
535812, "All right. Seems like I should rather talk to Andrey than you."
535813, "Why would he wait for a chicken?"
535814, "Listen here, your insults are absolutely baseless! I was the person to equip Andrey in the first place. It's not my fault he gave his weapon away to that psychic girl. Here, take this-and give it to him. We've all pitched in..."
535815, "What marsh?"
535816, "The marsh where the gatherer lives, the one who wanted to take revenge on Andrey for buying infusion secrets. Then there are butchers, who were finally released from the Termitary today, and they were all too eager to get even with Andrey, having found out that there had been a murderous feud among the gatherers because of him. They also went to that gatherer."
535817, "I see. I know where to look now."
535818, "I beg your pardon!"
535819, "What, am I wrong?"
535820, "Pardon denied."
535821, "Neither do I. I'm terrified of them."
535822, "And what is that thing you're holding behind your back embarrassedly, huh?"
535823, "I'll do just fine without it. Get away from me. I don't like you."
535824, "Perhaps."
535825, "She is magnanimous. That is her main virtue. Blessed naturally with an abundant spiritual wealth, she gives it away with the generosity that would befit royalty."
535826, "Can't say I agree."
535827, "How can you tell if you haven't spoken with her for quite a while?"
535828, "Madness is frightening... It's the only thing I'm truly afraid of. "
535831, "And then what? "
535832, "I barely had time to comprehend what had happened-and then the dancer, Ayan, appeared. She said that the Worms were sending their regards-they were thankful that I had fed my woman to them. 'We're even now,' they said. You know me; without further dilly-dallying, I put two and two together, and came to the conclusion that they were referring to Eva."
535833, "Well, I just assumed it could have been Eva-and went straight to the Worms. And I sent the girl to you in case Eva had indeed decided to end her life at the Cathedral. But Ayan messed everything up. So here we are... "
535834, "Whoa... an unexpected turn of events. How do you know this?"
535835, "Here we are where?"
535838, "It makes sense. She wrote to me that the only thing she was always ready to give her life for is the cause my brother and I have pledged ourselves to. So she wanted to imbue the building with her soul. That was her personal interpretation of our cause-an interpretation both deranged and... lovely. She knew how to get straight to the heart..."
535840, "Don't you think it's your pride talking?"
535841, "I'm gutted and turned inside out. I'm neither pious not exceptionally moral, you know, but that's simply too much. I need to find a way to keep living and working so that Eva's death wouldn't have been in vain."
535842, "What focus? You mean the Focus that the Kains mentioned?"
535843, "Now it is not the best moment to discuss that. Whether Eva was out of her mind or not... I do not know. And what has she written to you? "
535844, "She said she was going to purify the place for the new guest. That means the place is the Cathedral and the guest is Aglaya, right? "
535845, "Why are you confident that she has gone mad? "
535846, "But her interpretation was too literal. Someone must have put it into her head... And I think I know who!"
535847, "And who might these petitioners be?"
535848, "Petitioners indeed! Well, see, we've heard all about your efforts... so, well... we've decided to set up embassy here. We've been told all about your plan to sterilize us all."
535849, "What?! Who told you this drivel?"
535850, "Uncle Bachelor, we don't need vaccine. The order was the Inquisitor's, but you'll be held responsible. Don't! It'll be a simple waste of precious medicine, better give it to our families. We're all healthy up there-and healthy will we remain. Hand on heart."
535851, "I'd rather preferred Eva Yan in her stead..."
535852, "Yes, I was going to touch on that."
535853, "With your kind permission, let us put that conversation off until tomorrow. Before we start the search, I need to get the fullest picture of what's happened here. So right now the priority is to interrogate the Bound and collect the watchers' reports."
535854, "So, where's the source?"
535855, "So: there is a faulty detail in this mechanism of ours. We only need to find it. Where do we start?"
535856, "Easy for you to say."
535857, "You seem to know something already..."
535858, "Conjecture, pure conjecture... and nothing but conjecture. The Olgimskys' closet can barely hold a gigantic skeleton, and I can't really say I even care as to who had put it there. But here's what I'm thinking: what if this skeleton's made such a ruckus falling out to cover for another one? Although... don't lose sleep over this one yet."
535859, "Go ahead."
535860, "Thanatica has already been destroyed. There's nothing left; the place itself is in ruins, your research is in ashes. Your papers have been burnt. Wretched Telman made sure of it personally. And now I am going to tell you about the law."
535861, "...Why not. Go ahead."
535862, "In accordance with the Law, the very logic of our world inevitably dictates the destruction of anything unnatural: anything that tries to break its own, non-capitalized laws. The disease is nothing more than a tool. It is an instrument of inevitability."
535863, "I agree. The idea isn't new. It occurred to me before."
535864, "Inevitability. Gruesome inevitability is our true enemy. An enemy that cannot be defeated. By anyone. Anywhere. The only thing you can do is get what's dear to you out of its way. Don't make enemies with inevitability!"
535865, "And so we're back to the source now. Sources... it's always about sources, isn't it? We just can't get away from them, we... sourcerers, if you pardon the lame pun. But sourcerers do not wield magic."
535866, "The source? I'll tell you where to look for the source. So you think you're well aware of what the Law is, aren't you?"
535867, "...Are you telling the truth?"
535868, "Yes. I know how much you appreciate the truth; so do I, trust me. Looking for the truth is my job. I consider you to be my equal, and so there is no reason for me to lie to you. That would be a disservice to myself... and to the job itself, of course. Would you be interested to know more about the Law? The path of logic, so to speak?"
535869, "Yes. Go ahead."
535870, "No. I don't care. I apologize; I want to be alone for a while now."
535871, "And yet I have sworn to destroy this enemy."
535872, "Darting away from harm's way? This is now my modus operandi."
535873, "You're doomed then. "
535874, "I'm doomed then."
535875, "Well... You're a profound thinker, no denying that. We'll see as to how effective this philosophy turns out to be in practice."
535876, "This preaching would have made more sense before the plague... Say what you will, but fighting this enemy is my duty. As it is yours."
535877, "You're right. The second part of the game is beginning. Our current task is to remain true to ourselves. We'll keep the word we've given to the Powers That Be-both of us; it wasn't just you, mind. We'll uncover the truth, take a foreign detail out of the mechanism, and stop the rot before it devours this land. We only have to find out how it started."
535880, "So it's pointless to look for the source, isn't it?"
535881, "I can see where you're going with this."
535882, "Aren't you a nimble lad? Behave yourself!"
535883, "Sterilize, huh?"
535884, "Umm... Wrong wording, I guess? I meant curing us... eh... making us healthy, that is, distributing protective pills, wiping us with spirits, gargle with mouthwash if you please, bathe your feet like a good kid you are? To avoid the infection and stuff."
535885, "Ah, I see... Yes, I did indeed have such a plan."
535886, "The thought never even crossed my mind."
535887, "What is that supposed to mean, young man?"
535888, "Our Tower is magical. It protects us from the outer world. Everybody knows that, duh! And we're, like... See, if you care about us so much, better bring us some dry blue fire that doesn't burn paper! You've come from another place, after all... Do they have that kind of fire there?"
535889, "Dang it, I think I've misplaced my piece. Sorry."
535890, "I'll cure myself."
535891, "Mechanics, huh...? Like you know what the word even means! I need proof!"
535892, "Oh, just ask anyone. Even Capella! Yeah, go pay her a visit! She doesn't believe in the Tower's miracles at all, but she'll provide you with proof all right. She wouldn't lie after all. Which means her testimony is the most reliable one... I guess."
535893, "No no no, we don't need any of this. I'm telling you, the Tower is specular, it's maed of mirrors-that reflect the disease back out."
535894, "I don't believe you. And I don't see any miracles there anyway."
535895, "Indeed, she seemed like a very reasonable young lady to me."
535896, "Too bad. We were so sure you'd give us magical fire. Real fire can damage our Tower, you see."
535897, "Who can vouch that there are indeed no infected children in the Tower? I swallowed that bait once already."
535898, "No, I like it here. The place grew on me."
535899, "And who says that?"
535900, "Its inhabitants."
535901, "That's not how it is. You cannot ignore the obvious. The Tower does manage to perform truly breathtaking feats. And yes, by the way, I am sure that the disease-being of particular interest to you-or any other evil from outside cannot get into the tower whatsoever. It is evil enough on its own."
535902, "What feats, for example?"
535903, "It seems to somehow affect the internal state of a person. And so the wonderful but fleeting things, such as dreams, love, the accidental concurrence of fantasies, obsession with desires, or mystical games-all of those thing last... forever inside-against their evanescent nature."
535904, "How in the world is it blasphemous?"
535905, "Just, you know... people."
535906, "Yes, the Tower preserves childhood together with all its magic. But you cannot grasp a miracle and hold to it mechanically! You cannot treat the miraculous like that! A miracle can only reveal itself through a living person-like my mother... and be born of magical power, not of rationale!"
535907, "So does the Tower do it rationally?"
535908, "I'd like to know more about its inherent evil, young lady."
535909, "I admit that the Tower can perform miracles-but I do not believe it's miraculous by nature. It's dead, you see. It does not live. That is why it can do what it does-a living person would see just how blasphemous it is!"
535910, "Incredible... Are you laughing at me?"
535911, "Not in the slightest. That's exactly why the children are so fond of it. All their wonderful games, the magical places, the journeys towards outer worlds-all the wonders of  сhildhood are consentrated in the Tower. And they never go."
535912, "You are laughing at me!"
535913, "It also allows you to come back... say, to a particular dream. Or a forgotten game. But most importantly-it allows you to do so in someone else's company! You can bring a person-or even persons, I believe-into your dream. They can see your revery through your own eyes. They can fall in love with what you love."
535914, "So what does it do?"
535915, "If there's even a shred of truth to what you're saying, then it is indeed astonishing..."
535916, "I was mislead. I've been told you were sceptical towards this structure, resentful even. And what do I see?"
535917, "The Kains have set up a seditious experiment. The Stamatins brag that they had overcome the laws of gravity and Euclidean geometry, whilst in reality it was the Kains who took it upon themselves to attack the laws of sorcery and the miraculous powers that stumble upon our world from time to time! While the Stamatins were building ladders, the Kains were creating Foci..."
535918, "And what's wrong with that? Isn't it wonderful?"
535919, "If everybody settled for this line of thinking, humankind would have never conquered the skies or explored the nature of flame."
535920, "I was actually on my way there."
535921, "If you happen to come by, please give her this medicine and tell her that I-me personally, it's important!-that I told her to take it if she ever feels unwell. She will trust me. Otherwise they'll keep taking those horrible yellow pills-the only ones they acknowledge..."
535922, "I have."
535923, "I can't promise anything."
535924, "Please come by later to tell me how it went! It means the world to me."
535925, "Sure. And this Tower story of yours was... most engaging. I'm very happy I've decided to drop by."
535926, "She is five-and keeps five thousand people under here rule. Well, it's less than five now, I guess... Still, how is that possible?"
535927, "He is a holy child. The Kin will live and thrive as long she is healthy and happy."
535928, "Yes, while in the Termitary, I've noticed the apparent signs of intense vitality and overall thriving..."
535929, "And yet she follows your word?"
535930, "Don't you dare!"
535931, "Can I talk to him?"
535932, "No."
535933, "Tell the butchers to let me in, please."
535934, "Can I talk to him?"
535935, "No."
535936, "Tell the butchers to let me in, please."
535937, "It is real, just unusual."
535938, "Well, Capella told me you should take them. If you ever get sick. All right?"
535939, "Well... all right. But only because Capella says so. I would swallow a bumblebee for her!"
535941, "No. I don't believe you. These thingies look very very suspicious. I think they're counterfeit."
535942, "Look at you, using such big words!"
535943, "...They're not counterfeit. These are antibiotics."
535944, "It's fine. A revolver is a rather capable translator."
535957, "...What, antibodies?"
535958, "Yes. Antibodies. You already know what living bacteria look like, as well as dead ones. Stakh told me all about that. I think it won't be too hard for you to establish what this blood does to the infection."
535959, "Whose blood is this, Burakh?"
535960, "I can't tell you."
535961, "No, keep it. I've already produced a vaccine. The town is locked down tight. I have no need of a panacea."
535962, "I am not going to have any business with a person who doesn't trust me."
535963, "All right, I'll have a look. Where do I find you?"
535964, "The result, oynon? You know I can't tell you. I'm bound by a word given, and I thought that was something you respected."
535965, "Well, in short, yes, it does produce two types of antibodies-one stops the horned bacteria from propagating, another one kills them. We've got a unicum here."
535966, "Why is it alive? As if just extracted from the body. But surely a lot of time must have passed..."
535967, "You wouldn't understand, oynon. It is a kind of knowledge that's incompatible with yours. I have no idea myself yet. Too much learning in my head after these universities of yours... only adds to the confusion. Any antibodies in there?"
535968, "There are. Rather unique antibodies at that."
535969, "No. Nothing in there."
535970, "I see."
535971, "Inconcievable! A child ending up it such a position!"
535972, "I'm far more interested in how she manages to cope with all these horrors."
535973, "They don't let here out of her room though... do they?"
535974, "They do. I've met her in the other building. Thing is, she's not vile or heartless. She's simply from another era. Death does not frighten her."
535975, "Why wouldn't she let me in?"
535976, "Thank you. I think I have a plan now."
535977, "Brewers of fake panacea are holed up somewhere here in the Termitary. Do you know anything about that?"
535978, "What? Someone's making fake panacea, in here? But this is..."
535979, "Just an unproven rumour."
535980, "...Yes, an inconceivable villainy. Have you maybe noticed anything suspicious?"
535981, "Hold on a second... Some odonghe on the second floor asked for corpses of the freshly dead. They seemed to be looking for someone they knew. I took no notice back then. Apart from that, newcomer tramps went around looking for some room along that wall across the entrance. Dangled money... "
535982, "Which room? On the second floor as well?"
535983, "Damned if I know... I had a short way with them."
535984, "Oh, right. Is that them under the sheet?"
535985, "Thank you, Burakh."
535986, "So, tell me, Mother, does anyone around here produce medicine?"
535987, "How can you make medicine if you're not a doctor? It's forbidden. And it won't work..."
535988, "Right. Those people are criminals. They deserve to be punished."
535989, "Go ahead and punish them then. I'd punish such people too If I saw them. Unless they know the lines, that is."
535990, "Are you saying your servants wouldn't touch me if I attacked those bad people?"
535991, "You might be right."
535992, "Huh, you just gave me an excellent idea... But you seem to be scared?"
535993, "The 'crud'?"
535994, "I'll have you know that a certain informer of mine... a trustworthy source despite being a Worm... has told me that there's a flow of fake panacea coming out of the Termitary. I'll be honest with you; this is encroaching upon my interests. So I'm turning to you for help. This concerns you as well, after all."
535995, "And what are your interests?"
535996, "Truth is, the slimeballs are backing themselves up with... yes, your own good name. They claim that the recipe is yours and even provide some, erm, proof of authorship. I don't know what exactly that is, but, really, your name is actually proof enough for the general crowd... they're rather naïve. And the heart incident has already become common knowledge... in certain circles at least."
535997, "What does that have to do with anything? The heart was required to extract a microbial culture sample!"
535998, "Well, in any case... They're procuring live hearts, of which there's no shortage in the Termitary now... and preparing the potions right in front of their buyers. You can imagine the resulting product."
535999, "I've heard you loud and clear. So you're saying they've set up shop in the Termitary, right?"
536000, "My informer said that it's one of the rooms in the Long Block. He hasn't seen it himself. "
536001, "What does it have to do with my visit to the Termitary?"
536002, "This concerns me? How?"
536003, "It's all very simple. Panacea will always be in short supply, that much is obvious. My dear friend Burakh, the highest authority on this, claims that he'll be able to produce fifteen batches at best. I'm interested in seeing them find their way... into the right hands."
536004, "But who would buy unverified panacea?"
536005, "What is that supposed to mean?"
536006, "As soon as the Bound find out about the panacea, or worse yet, get their hands on a flask of that ersatz drug... You've seen them-they're romantics just waiting for an opportunity to pull off a heroic sacrifice. Obtaining fake panacea would cause them to lose all prudence. They'll take risks, rush headlong into infection hotspots thinking they have salvation in their pocket... and then the salvation won't work."
536007, "Are you sure that a real panacea even exists?"
536008, "Oh, yes, it does-since yesterday. I've checked. The Inquisitor is aware, by the way, although it's being kept secret for now... for obvious reasons."
536009, "All right. And what do you know about those remedy-makers?"
536010, "The heart incident was Burakh's handiwork. I had nothing to do with it."
536011, "I never expected you to care so much about other people... Yes, you are of course correct. The consequences could be abysmal."
536012, "Yes, like I said, the matter is urgent. Not only must we weed out those criminals, we must also put a stop to the rumours... as well as the crudflow. And it would be better for you to accomplish all of that personally... Burakh might be better suited for the job... but it's not about skill or connections; I just feel like we should avoid unnecessary gossip..."
536013, "I don't understand. What are you implying?"
536014, "I shudder to imagine the sheer number of rooms there... I have my work cut out for me."
536015, "Yes, when I learned that Burakh had concocted a panacea, I decided to completely seize the flow of goods. That's how the informers came to know... I requested it on purpose. Make no mistake, this isn't about greed... I simply thought it would be prudent to control this market. One would emerge anyway..."
536016, "So your concern for the Bound was only a disguise? Your were only ever concerned with turning a profit..."
536017, "It seems my old reputation will take a while to get rid of... Your knowledge is outdated, Bachelor. Things have changed. I have changed. This morning I wanted to seize the panacea black market... so I bought up everything that Burakh has made and distributed..."
536018, "And?"
536019, "I gave away all that I had bought. No money... well, a little money, so that it wouldn't look like I'm offering a donation. I gave it all to the Bound. The ones who needed it the most... in my opinion. Those who nearly died because of me."
536020, "Who?"
536021, "Oh, and to think I almost believed you... I even regretted thinking you a cynical man!"
536022, "...But you have spared at least one for yourself, I hope? Haven't you?"
536023, "I need neither money nor protection from death now. The latter because I want to give the plague the opportunity to punish me for my acts. And the former... please spare me your mockery... is because I now aspire to something. Call me sentimental. I won't reveal it; I don't want to scare the dream away."
536024, "Hm. 'A little' by your standards?"
536025, "Not really... by common ones, I would think. By peacetime standards, even... Five hundred coins for a flask seems to be perfectly reasonable-especially considering antibiotics cost two or three thousand now."
536026, "I regret my sarcasm, master Vlad. I beg your forgiveness."
536027, "I wonder if your buyers will corroborate your story."
536028, "You are a noble man, master Vlad. Allow me to shake your hand!"
536029, "You're more than welcome... We're not asking much, merely thirty thousand. But for you, oynon, it's free! Dead gruel, never better. All the rot comes out, all the evil hexes come off, oh yes, my good man..."
536030, "Merely thirty thousand, huh? Are you sure you're not underselling, mate?"
536031, "Ay, oynon, have mercy, let us be! We won't sell anything anymore, won't cook the gruel... You let us live, you don't turn us in to the Mother-we tell you an interesting something then. You'll be pleased..."
536032, "Speak. I'm not going to touch you, word."
536033, "I haven't yet decided what to do with you."
536034, "So you're using my method, is that it? Peddling your filth under my name, you scum!"
536035, "Speak then. If I like what I hear, I won't give you away."
536036, "...Vlad the Younger, you mean?"
536037, "Yes, oynon, yes... Him. The bloodsucker. Have mercy on us, oynon, don't shoot us slack-baked folk..."
536038, "How do you know about this?"
536039, "Lots of people come through here, oynon... This we know from someone holy, someone worth trusting."
536040, "...Do you know what the real panacea is made of?"
536041, "Right... figures. So she's into panacea now too?"
536042, "Yes, the whole ordeal is surreal. But you seem to be unfazed by it."
536043, "Incredible. I'm starting to suspect he's in league with you."
536044, "It's the Tower. The only thing that leads the plots of my performances astray is the Tower. The Tower-and everything that has to do with it... those are the only things that cannot be tossed and turned and manipulated like puppets. A miracle overcomes the inevitable. The Tower can do miracles. It all makes sense."
536045, "I'm not sure it does."
536046, "You will still have an opportunity to ponder it. The Tower is an ambiguous phenomenon. There's no need to rush to conclusions. I have, as you can see, fallen in love with it... I think of it as my safe haven. But you should keep a cool head."
536047, "I don't know if I want to... That's how many stunning discoveries I've made today."
536048, "Oh fine... He gave it to the girls-to Yulia, Lara, and the third one that begs to keep her name secret under any circumstances. Think of them as the three parcae..."
536049, "He isn't. First of all, I also believe in lofty ideals-don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The salvation is not about the panacea. The panacea is transitory. But recently I came to realize something that has blown me out of the water completely and made me reevaluate my worldview. So... I believe in Vlad's transformation."
536050, "What did you realize?"
536051, "That fate can be overcome. I'm so tired of all this... You know, many people consider my shows to be mere tricks-but I know that's untrue. They are daily reminders of Predetermination reigning over us... it's depressing. But now I see that a miracle is not completely impossible."
536052, "Please, go on! What makes it possible?"
536053, "Did Vlad really let someone else have his panacea? I didn't believe him... "
536054, "Hmm. Yes, he's given his panacea to the girls that have once almost died through his fault... at least he thinks so now... actually, it's very typical of a person of his temper... in a situation like this. He's giving his possessions away with a firm and steady hand. Paying the old debts."
536055, "Who are these girls? "
536056, "I see. Thank you."
536057, "...Sure. So what have you done with your vial of panacea?"
536058, "I have an idea about what to do with it. I won't share it with you, sorry. I fear this... Changeling. She is a remarkable foe and a worthy opponent... when in comes to miracle-making. A rather nimble girl. She's gathering intelligence now, you see, and her intentions are dark. Her intuition is spot on, so I'd rather she knew less."
536059, "Don't you trust me?"
536060, "Don't worry, I will. You know that I am a man of principle."
536061, "Oh, undoubtely."
536062, "In that case tell me at least who else Vlad the Younger shared panacea with."
536063, "Her intentions are dark?"
536064, "She is a fanatic. And, like any fanatic, she is obsessed. I think she has a very... unique idea of what to do with the precious vials. She may even try to destroy them."
536065, "But what for? "
536066, "Can there be another source of miracles-apart from her, that is? That would be blaspemy and sacrilege to her. People should only hope for the power emanating from her, otherwise the power will dry out... without the faith, that is. And if it does, the designs of the poor thing will fall through. And she has grand designs, believe me."
536067, "Mine are definitely grander. Or at least more reliable."
536068, "Oh yes... She's an incredibly mysterious person. Rest assured that her incognito will not be uncovered."
536069, "I see. Why, thank you for the engaging conversation. "
536070, "What a relief."
536071, "Well... To tell the truth, it is a bit annoying. You know, recently I've been driven to change my views on what 'fate' is a little too often."
536072, "Could be... Wait a minute... something awful has just occurred to me, thanks to you."
536073, "Don't worry about it. Not that I ever took it seriously... a pretty vial and hardly anything more than that."
536074, "What did Younger Vlad have to say about it? "
536075, "Thank you.  Don't hurry to drink it, Yulia. Its origin is unclear. "
536076, "You know what? Come back tomorrow. We will be able to hold a much more productive discussion then, which may be of some use to us both. Meanwhile, I need to think. You see, everything that went on is rather curious in the light of certain theories I entertain. Numbers, equations, calculations of possibility... everything you don't seem to be too fond of yourself."
536077, "Give it to me, Yulia."
536078, "Not that I mind... But, I am sorry to say I was advised not to. I gave my word that I would not co-operate with you. Don't be so disappointed. I am not enjoying this whole rigmarole myself. I am clueless as to what it is intended for. The mind boggles..."
536079, "Who did you give your word to? Was it Vlad the Younger or Clara?"
536080, "Very well. I'll be back tomorrow."
536081, "I rely on your common sense, Yulia."
536082, "If Aglaya Lilich tells the truth... than we may be in luck."
536083, "Lara, I know everything. Just tell me how it went. How much did he make you shell out?"
536084, "...Nothing. It wasn't an item to sell, it was a gift. Have you seen the man recently? He's positively transformed! Something's happened to him, I'm good at spotting these things. But has it occurred to you that I may have parted with my panacea already? Yulia, for example, gave hers to Clara-at least that's what Clara says. So why do you think I haven't done the same?"
536085, "Please be careful with it. This vial can be the death of you."
536086, "You know what? Please come back tomorrow-and tomorrow we'll talk about it once more. Tomorrow everything will change... It's about many various intertwining plots and agendas. As for now, I don't have a panacea. Sorry."
536087, "Yeah, people say the thief has her way of making others part with their belongings..."
536088, "Damn it!"
536089, "Fine. I'll come back tomorrow."
536090, "You've let me down, Lara..."
536091, "By the way, do you by any chance know the unit number of the troops that have been sent here?"
536092, "No, I don't."
536093, "I'm surprised you're even asking."
536094, "My father... was an officer."
536095, "I'm sorry."
536096, "Nothing astonishes me anymore."
536097, "Will do. "
536098, "If he swears to leave alone the butchers that are now outside the Termitary, I'll talk three runaways into risking their lives. It's not like they have anything to lose anyway."
536099, "It's covered with... Wait-wait a minute... Is that leather?"
536100, "Yes, this looks very likely."
536101, "I don't know. I've failed to establish the details. In any case, I'm obviously alive."
536102, "You are a man of exceptional courage, Bachelor. Everything you have done is greatly appreciated. It seems I will have to think of some other way to test my theories."
536103, "I have decided to play the part of one. You should know who I am, executor."
536104, "You have my utmost respect... We are closely following your gallant exploits at all times."
536105, "How do you intend to test the drugs?"
536106, "Yes."
536107, "Immunity boosters or antibiotics?"
536108, "Both."
536109, "Take the boosters first. Just be careful-they're deadly in large doses... Sooner or later you'll start feeling dizzy-those are the first symptoms of the disease. Eventually, the fever will become unbearable... that will be the disease entering its critical phase."
536110, "I know that."
536111, "The latent stage is not life-threatening, but in such an environment, where one will breathe the disease and absorb it through his pores constantly, the infection will progress rapidly. Take the antibiotics then. They will kill off the bacterium when it propagates too much."
536112, "Are you trying to lecture me on microbiology?"
536113, "No, no... no need for that. I'm simply summarizing what we managed to learn after the First Outbreak... and in the last few days. I hope luck is on your side."
536114, "Get to business, dear sir."
536115, "Stop trying to be funny. There's no one here who could check my condition better than me."
536116, "And not bothered with this at all?"
536117, "Why do you think he has nothing to do with this?"
536118, "The victims of Sunday's mayhem join the ranks of the muggers... Further madness only provokes them... Honest housefathers grab their hatchets-because they see no other way to survive..."
536120, "Touching. So what, am I supposed to offer them a welcoming embrace now? No thank you."
536121, "Death wish? What do their... tendencies have to do with this?"
536122, "It makes them likely to volunteer, obviously. The matter is urgent-undoubtedly you can see that. Testing the immunity drugs would require exposing oneself to the risk of infection; and, of course, you have to be infected to test the antibiotics. 'Death-seekers' is a self-designation. They've chosen it because the Sand Pest spells certain death."
536123, "Why don't you want to supervise the whole thing yourself?"
536124, "You're projecting."
536125, "How so?"
536126, "Hm... Our kind volunteers are prone to foul play... I've had reports of the kind of talks happening between them. Honestly, if they vanish, I'll be convinced that they just made off with the pills..."
536127, "Did you do it... yourself?"
536128, "You were extremely reckless. The young ladies nearly died because of you."
536129, "It really doesn't seem so."
536130, "Those are mice."
536131, "I just want to know where you're going, peculiar creature."
536132, "Just dropping in to check on you."
536133, "Just spare me any surprises, will you? When I find myself in want of your help, I'll ask for it explicitly. "
536134, "You are mistaken. I know inquisitors well enough."
536135, "...At least I will fulfill my obligation to the Powers That Be and save my Thanatica. "
536136, "I do. They'll fail, rest assured."
536137, "You can rely on me-I'll try to stop the villains... at least some villains, anyway."
536138, "Come again? What did you say? Although... it doesn't matter now anyway."
536139, "Nothing much. It's amazing how I haven't turned grey with horror. That thing was really made of... shabnak knows what. "
536140, "See! And you said you didn't believe in shabnak! So, why didn't you kill it? "
536141, "I'm pretty sure it wasn't the carrier. It didn't even seem to have blood at all."
536142, "The generation part is important, isn't it?"
536143, "Yes. Don't you worry. "
536144, "I want to buy something... less than legal from you."
536145, "Far-off bells always ring sweet..."
536146, "How so?"
536147, "Show me the body please. I want to see it myself."
536148, "Finally! The operation's been a success, I hope?"
536149, "That depends on the result."
536150, "It was-if such dubious endeavour can be called an operation at all..."
536151, "The microscope is at your service, colleague. May you be the first to make the discovery!"
536152, "Much obliged."
536153, "It's a deal."
536154, "Why?"
536155, "My field of enquiry is ever the same. I am testing a theory which concerns what I refer to as the Trip Wires of Fate. You know I am a bit of a fatalist, don't you? Anyway, in order to further test my hypothesis, I will require your assistance with one of my enterprises. Apart from its sheer scientific value, this whole business will rid Lara Ravel of whatever is troubling her. Moreover, with a little bit of luck, an innocent life will be saved."
536156, "Oh really?"
536157, "Wait till you hear this one. Lara Ravel conspires to assassinate the Commander. She is so naïve, our Lara; barely able to keep her operation a secret. Half the town is aware that she seeks to purchase a firearm. No one would sell her one, of course. "
536158, "That's some news..."
536159, "Just wait till you've heard it all. The Commander was informed-by some unknown benefactor-that there will be an attempt on him soon. Along with everything else, the note contained a request: if the assassin proves to be a woman, she must not be killed. The weapon of the assassin, the note said, will be a harmless toy, and whoever wields it will not deserve anything more than a short-term imprisonment."
536160, "And why has she chosen such a target?"
536161, "And how do you know about the anonymous letter? Or are you its author?"
536162, "Ludicrous, is it not? The man was wounded four times at the Karstov Fords, which did nothing to impede him. He emerged a victor, regardless of the grenade fragment which sat bone-deep in his flesh. And there she is, expecting a hero as such to be killed by a pellet which would hardly suffice to put a dent in his uniform."
536163, "That's not what I meant. What's her problem with the Commander?"
536164, "And how do you know.... what you said about the bullet?"
536165, "Just as I told you; half the town knows the situation in detail. Worst of all, the Commander himself may learn any moment... The Changeling seems to be omnipresent... and frightfully quick to claim the ear of General Ashes. If only I was able to see through the motives of her actions!"
536166, "Perhaps she believes that he represents a kind of universal evil? An ultimate annihilator who has arrived with the only purpose of reducing the town to rubble. If only he was killed, Lara thinks, it would provide us with a much needed delay. After all, the medicine was already researched, she thinks... Was it, though?"
536167, "I don't know. "
536168, "What shall we do then?"
536169, "I can't recall the gist of the theory very well. I might have missed something."
536170, "It is well known that Block is as chivalrous as they come. If the hapless assassin is guaranteed safety, the unknown correspondent has promised to let the Commander know the name of the culprit and therefore spare him the tiresome necessity to seize every single person to appear within firing range. I don't think you would be too disappointed to learn that the letter was written by none other than Anna."
536171, "That dirty creature!"
536172, "Don't be too harsh on her. She's a thespian; a child, eager to entertain her whims. The assassination will be an utter fiasco. The military will be forewarned and the gun that Lara has obtained will not fire. They will treat Lara as they treat women they believe to be hysterical or deranged. They are going to lock her up."
536173, "So what is your plan?"
536174, "Why would you insinuate such a thing? I had absolutely nothing to do with the letter. It was someone else; someone very involved with this whole affair. Just like the rest of the parties, this person acts in good faith and conscience."
536175, "Including the informer? I doubt you can convince me of that."
536176, "But what does Anna have to gain from this? What is her deal? No, Yulia, you're not being entirely honest..."
536177, "Ask her, if you don't believe me. Anna's eccentricity is borderline hysterical. She is scared, perhaps, and eager to get on the good side of whoever she believes to be holding the most authority. "
536178, "Yulia, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. You are obviously hiding something. I'm not assisting you with this."
536179, "Very well. But what does this have to do with testing your fatalistic theories?"
536180, "Under house arrest? And what if they shoot you?"
536181, "The man who won the Battle of the Fords is going to shoot me? Don't be ridiculous. I have nothing at all to fear from him."
536182, "...Because you are a fatalist, and not afraid of death, right? Don't lie to me, Yulia. This is dangerous."
536183, "This is the best option, still. I know Lara too well; no one will be able to stop her. She will find a gun sooner or later... On the other hand-your cooperation may net you Anna's panacea in addition to my own, since Anna was the third person offered a vial. "
536184, "I don't know... It still doesn't seem like the brightest of ideas."
536185, "You think so?"
536186, "There's no reason to worry. This whole affair will hurt no one. Quite the opposite, in fact; everyone will benefit from it. Everyone-including yourself. I don't really need this vial of panacea, you see, I may be very easily persuaded to hand it over."
536187, "Your new friends fired at me."
536188, "Did they now? And you were perfectly able to defend yourself, I presume?"
536189, "Yes. All of them are dead."
536190, "Yulia, just be honest with me, why are you doing this?"
536191, "...My calculations were compromised by a factor I could not anticipate. Apparently it's best not to involve you in any affairs that have to do with fate and the diversity of its manifestations. I owe you a vial of panacea, then, don't I? "
536192, "Please, don't trouble yourself."
536193, "I think you are a very cunning woman, Yulia."
536194, "Nothing special. The soldiers outside are amiable fellows-they even gave a salute in my honour."
536195, "Well, well...  Do go on! Your words are music to my ears!"
536196, "You know, Vlad the Younger recently went through a dramatic metamorphosis! His eyes burn bright, his words are brave, his acts so noble-it all paints a great picture of him. He used to be a cynical leech, and now he is a hero. So why wouldn't I follow his example? Give away what little I have left? Count me in!"
536197, "Commendable, Anna. But how are you going to do that?"
536198, "Well, I have procured what Lara asked for. Voila! A small weapon of self-defense. Oh no, no need to thank me, I got it practically for free... you know, from the previous owner. But there's more! If you deliver this present to Lara anonymously, I will gladly give away the most valuable thing I own-my panacea!"
536199, "Why?"
536200, "Lara needs it for self-defense, she's afraid of the soldiers. You must give it to her in secret, no questions asked and... no names mentioned. When you deliver the pistol to Lara, come back for your reward. I don't mind parting with it anymore."
536201, "An uneasy conscience betrays itself, Anna. This is another folk saying."
536202, "I know all about your scheming. Explain yourself now. And no trying to weasel your way out of it!"
536203, "...There's no other way to stop our precious little Lara. Have you spoken with her? There you go! You see, she is slightly out of it. If I don't give her this toy, she's just going to get a real one... and fire it. Better she be arrested by our noble General Ashes than shot by the guards."
536204, "Who are you talking to, Lara?"
536205, "I know everything, madam! What's with the insane fantasies?"
536206, "Ah, thwarted again! Please, at least don't report me..."
536207, "But why?"
536208, "He is a war criminal! All his fame is nothing but lies! Hearsay would have him as some kind of faultless knight, but in reality he's a bloodthirsty butcher! And we'll all find that out soon enough... but by then it will be too late..."
536209, "I've asked everybody, even the Changeling! You know that tiny pistol she carries around? That looks very handy. It's just what I need... But she wouldn't give it to me. She said she has plans for me, that she requires my life."
536210, "And why do you need a pistol?"
536211, "I can't tell you... I just want a weapon! Yes, I'm scared of the soldiers. But it really has to be small, like Clara's-I won't be able to handle a big one, so I'll miss... I'll reward you, I'll give you whatever it may cost. Here, I saved up..."
536212, "Lara, I don't like this at all."
536217, "Yes... it depends. Some can take the life out of you with a few dried peas."
536218, "So your life is what you're going to risk, isn't it?"
536220, "Oh, it's not like you're my husband or older brother, are you now? If you won't bring it to me, I'll just ask the Haruspex, he's less squeamish. And I can give you a very rare and valuable thing in exchange. That thing from yesterday... remember?"
536221, "Fine. I'll get you a pistol."
536222, ""
536225, "I've had a very exhausting day-and I'm not the only one here who has, I suspect... We would all be better off if we had some rest. Let us talk business in the morning."
536226, "All right."
536227, "I have other plans for the night."
536228, "Don't be so fast to judge."
536229, "Indeed. Walking the streets of your town at night has been an entirely unpleasant experience since my first day here."
536230, "So you were expecting something? A calamity?"
536231, "There were dreams... devoid of images. But tonight I saw a fragment of one of the days to come."
536232, "...All these years I've been dreading war more than anything."
536233, "I heard you were offering a reward for exterminating the barbers?"
536234, "And what does it entail?"
536235, "A lot. In truth, I have never made such a promise before. My mother has... just twice, I think... and kept it both times. And because she was a Mistress, it meant that the wish could be anything. A Mistress would find a way to fulfill it."
536236, "Your mother did this twice? Why?"
536237, "...This is not really something we talk about. I will tell you, but l'll do so later. For now, I'm not allowed to... and neither can I give such a promise. I just couldn't help myself; it was a lapse of the tongue."
536238, "So what exactly happened back then?"
536239, "Spoken words are like flown birds, Maria. Neither can be recalled."
536240, "I don't need your reward. I'll fight the robbers because my principles dictate so."
536244, "That sounds mighty suspicious."
536245, "That would be redundant in your case. Your-how did you put it?-virtues are already a sight to see."
536246, "...Anna, are you really that stupid, or is this just you acting?"
536247, "Fair enough... Not only are you a hypocrite, you are an idiot too... "
536248, "Pardon me? You've thrown me off a bit..."
536249, "What are you up to?"
536250, "So you say your pistol is only a toy? Dubious, all of this..."
536251, "Why inform on her then?"
536252, "Oh, the wisest of bachelors, you really have no idea... There's one more actor on this stage. And what an actor she is-a prima donna! I could never outdo her. It's Yulia. She was the first to find out, and wanted to fix it so that everything would seem to be my fault. So I had to tell the truth. She would have had me otherwise."
536253, "Then why the secrecy? I was told the letters were sent anonymously."
536254, "So I'll talk to Yulia. And then I'll get back to you. Maybe. Depending on the result."
536255, "Take it. I just happen to have one."
536256, "Are you saying you have no need of that thing anymore? And why would that be? No, Lara. I need you alive. Don't even think about getting a firearm."
536257, "Yes, that's exactly the kind I needed. Thank you."
536258, "Good luck, Lara Ravel."
536259, "Someone already has, Lara. You won't accomplish anything."
536260, "But who did it? And more importantly, why? He is an evil demon, he deserved this..."
536261, "It's the Changeling and her hidden plots. You shouldn't have trusted her."
536262, "Anna Angel. Your choice of friends is imprudent."
536263, "Your plot has been exposed. Praise the heavens that your name remains a secret for now."
536264, "You still don't realize who the real demon is..."
536265, "So you decided to make an attempt on him? Very well. Go ahead and try. But you may come to regret it."
536266, "A panacea? I won't take it. Farewell, Lara."
536267, "Unfortunately I cannot boast the same."
536268, "Glad to hear that. I'm counting on you."

536270, "Would you like to inspect the Cathedral?"
536271, "So there really is a spring with drinking water inside?"
536274, ""
536275, "Is it true that you've ordered to arrange... a morgue in the town Theatre?"
536276, "A hospital, kind sir. A hospital."
536279, "The Theatre is closed for the public. We await further orders from you."
536280, "They're simple. Bring the infected here before their disease enters critical stage. Take care of them according to my instructions."
536281, "Will do. Anything else?"
536282, "Obviously, you also need to arrange for the dead bodies to be transported to the cemetery and buried."
536283, "Act as the situation demands."
536284, "The Cathedral is closed. We await your orders."
536285, "My orders are simple. Any person who, for whatever reason, has entered an infected district, is to come here. Keep track of them. If there are no signs of infection after four hours, let them go."
536286, "And if there are?"
536287, "Take them outside immediately and have them wait for the sanitary party. Apply antiseptics and give an antibiotic to anyone who was near the infected."
536288, "Act as the situation demands."
536289, "I've already seen everything I need."
536290, "Yes, two even. I think it's going to be very crowded here soon... Do you know there's been some strange sabotage? Someone ruined the town's water supply, and drinking from the river doesn't feel safe nowadays..."
536291, "Above all, you must prevent any contact between the quarantined and other people. Even their families."
536292, "Will do, sir. Anything else?"
536293, "Can the Cathedral be locked from the outside?"
536294, "No."
536295, "Yes."
536296, "Then keep it locked. And reinforce the guard. The quarantined must not leave the building before the designated time. Expect rioting."
536297, "You can let people inside until we start getting the first potentially infected. I forbid entry after that."
536298, "You're right. It's best to avoid drinking from the river for now."
536299, "I disagree. It's safe to drink water from the river, it just needs to be boiled."
536300, "Please be so kind as to take my orders seriously! "
536301, "Please do come in! The facility is ready to be examined."
536302, "Is the supply of spring water constant? "
536303, "Thank you."
536304, "You're welcome to check it yourself, honourable Bachelor... You're welcome."
536305, "Fine. Carry on with your duties."
536306, "Clean up the facility. And order the delivery of anything that the hospital attendants might require."
536307, "No, that's all."
536308, "Will do. What should we do if the disease finally gets to the... well... critical stage?"
536309, "Hand out pain relievers. Suppress panic and aggression. Act as the situation demands."
536310, "Find a place for them apart from the rest of the patients. Say... second balcony."
536311, "It's still too early to give up."
536312, "It's remarkable how this... microorganism seems to penetrate walls and permeate the air. It's not supposed to. This microbe doesn't survive long outside a nutrient-rich environment."
536314, "A new phenomenon manifested itself today. It might be of interest to you, as it admittedly is to me. We may have stumbled upon a mystery whose solution may have far-reaching consequences. This concerns the Skinners district."
536315, "With it we'll quickly learn the duration of this mysterious fever's latent phase."
536316, "'The Blockaded District'"
536317, "Victor said that my word would suffice. Still, I think he would appreciate if I provided some evidence of how thorough the inspection was. I believe that a dead looter's belongings will serve this purpose just fine."
536318, "*** The district is hazardous still, but for reasons other than the disease. Fortunately, the looters are much easier to get rid of. This district will be repopulated soon, as will many other ones. What Victor did is a laudable accomplishment, no less."
536319, "I was informed that our major concern today is to prepare the town to defend itself in the face of the calamity that has befallen us. Although it is the Olgimsky family who are in charge of these issues, we would like to contribute as much as we can. Besides, something tells me you are not going to be all that happy with the yieldings of Vlad's undertakings./n/nPlease find a moment to discuss a certain idea with me./n/nVictor Kain"

536323, "*** Let him search for his wanton daughter himself! I've got more important matters to take care of!"
536324, "God will provide."
536325, "Go, sweetie, this is no place for you to be."
536326, "Yeah, keep listening to your Notkin, you little brat!"
536327, "Blood. I'm talking about blood. We obviously have to find her now. How is that hard to grasp?"
536328, "More maneater-hunting?"
536329, "Hold your horses. Leave this to me. "
536330, "I can see that myself."
536331, "And what were you doing, I wonder? Huh? I'll have you all court-martialled!"
536332, "Simon is alive! I just saw him suddenly appear at the Crucible! I sense him, you know, I can't ignore it... I woke up, but the feeling refused to let go of me... He's there, he is still there! It was all a lie, an illusion! Rubin will back up my words."
536333, "I don't understand. Why Rubin?"
536334, "Rubin must tell the truth... he never lies if you make him swear on his Master's name... He will tell you then that he never dissected the body. Simon is at the Crucible! It was all an illusion, a deception!"
536335, "Why would somebody arrange such a deception?"
536336, "Illusions... The Kains engineered the epidemic... then hid it behind a false murder... Simon is at the Crucible, I know he is-and I will have proof. If you won't do it, I'll stoop to asking the Changeling... And even the Haruspex if she refuses too! Aglaya will heed their words... more willingly than she would heed mine... And she needs to know."
536337, "Simon is, to a certain extent, a concept... That much I have concluded by now. Which means your words can be taken very much as an allegory."

536339, "You've made a wise choice, Bachelor. But we've encountered certain complications..."
536340, "What is it?"
536341, "There are already half a thousand people who have agreed to leave the infected districts for the Cathedral. It's you who they owe their lives to, Bachelor."
536342, "You've mentioned complications."
536343, "There are food issues. We still have enough water, but the people are starving. The crowd is beginning to get cranky. They demand to be allowed to go search for food in the clean districts."
536344, "And I demand they don't. Don't let anyone out. Direct orders from me."
536345, "I'll speak to Olgimsky. You will be getting food supplies."
536346, "If you let anyone out, the whole idea of an isolation ward goes down the drain. Tell them we're almost done with the vaccine. They only need to wait a little longer-two days at most."
536347, "'We'...?"
536348, "I. I'm almost done with the vaccine."
536349, "Yes, we. I refer to myself in plural because I bloody well deserve it! Too bad you don't seem to share this opinion."
536350, "Spare me the pathos! What do you need?"
536351, "We first encountered them several days ago, in case you didn't notice."
536352, ""
536353, "Bachelor Dankovsky! I'm not sure what your instructions were and what Big Vlad's opinion on this is, but we've only received a tiny fraction of the food supply required. People demand that we let couriers in."
536354, "I know the town is starving. They know it as well. The goods train is going to arrive very soon. They'll have to be patient."
536355, "If you say so. Perhaps you would like to know there are more than seven hundred people inside. Even the upper galleries are crowded already."
536356, "Let them brace themselves. It won't take long now."
536357, "When the Cathedral gets overcrowded, we'll find another place. For what it's worth, we can use the structure on the other side of the river-even though it's usually off-limits."
536358, "No can do. We'd rather die out here than go there."
536359, "Bah, it's useless to argue with you people..."
536360, "You not only can, but will do whatever I order you to do."
536361, "Here, that's all the food I've got on me right now. Distribute it among the children. I'll fetch some more by the morning. But no aimless wandering back and forth! Make sure this door only gets unlocked according to the regulations."

536381, "My God, you're doing it again... That's it, I have had enough!"
536382, "You say you can feel his presence, but if Simon is alive, why weren't you feeling it all this time? Surely he couldn't have risen from the dead?"
536385, "One would certainly think so... Katerina, you're on the verge of real madness. The whole town is. And I, a champion of reason, fear madness over anything else! Farewell."
536386, "I do not know myself... I would never mislead you... why would I? We the Saburovs are done for... We were the first to suffer Clara's punishing hand... whoever wins, we shall never again rise from the ashes... and still I say to you-he is there! This is for you..."
536387, "No! No! That's exactly why the Kains are so abhorrent... Any fantasy that only has the right to exist in the realm of dreams, they give substance. It's as if they're just bringing all those illusions, all the vastness available to the human imagination, into this world!"
536388, "What's so abhorrent about that? They deserve praise... worship even... if this is actually true."

536390, "Oh yes! Look around and see the fruits of that worship! No, they have no place on this earth! I speak as the protector of the weak! I speak on their behalf! When those such as them begin to create, the weak are always the first to suffer. Everything the Kains do is a challenge, and challenges are for the strong! How are the rest of us supposed to live?"
536391, "You speak on behalf of puppets. Let the weak become strong then."
536392, "There's no compassion in you... so ruthless... how can you be so? Even Burakh, that dreadful ripper destined to drown us all in blood... even he has more compassion for people than you."
536393, "What do you want from me, Katerina?"
536394, "Fine. But why are you so upset?"
536395, "Yeah, his compassion is evident. The crow bewails the sheep, and then eats it."
536396, "Indeed. Whenever an exceptional feat is achieved, the dregs are forced to compare their whole lives with its greatness... not a simple challenge."
536397, "Wait, there are several dead in there now?"
536398, "Why, blasphemy, of course... Or do you still not realize the fate that befell Simon?"
536399, "Tell me the truth, Rubin. Is Simon alive? "
536400, "What do you mean? Simon is dead. Certainly dead, now. Although he was alive... for all the while he was thought to be dead."
536401, "Then your transgression is not so great, colleague."
536402, "Farewell, Rubin."
536403, "How are you certain that the man whose body you took was Simon Kain?"
536404, "You think I don't know what Simon looked like? You think his greatness, his noble visage, is comparable to his brother or anyone else? After all, if it wasn't his superhuman blood, who else's could fight the disease for so long and almost beat it, even if at the cost of lethargy? Whose? Can you tell me?"
536405, "Understand that in all my time here I have never-not even once-seen Simon; the only man I hoped to meet here! I never saw him alive, never saw him dead! What do you expect me to believe?"
536406, "Fine. Ask at the Crucible! Since they let me go, they clearly don't think of me as either a murderer, or as a blasphemer! Let them explain where Simon is! I've said all I can!"
536407, "By the name of your Master, Rubin, answer me... did you tell the truth? "
536408, "I don't. I feel like I'm still missing something."
536409, "Katerina Saburova came back from another soujourn with the spirits and declared that Simon has arisen in The Crucible. Just now. She's hysterical."
536410, "Hm... well, Katerina is... That Clara did something to her... took her power and her crown as a Mistress. Are you certain that she said that? It's impossible. I broke Simon down into tiny particles with my own hands, and turned him into the white vaccine."
536411, "Dear colleague, I stole the body from the Kains-the body that was sacred to them. With my own hands I took Simon Kain's life... if that state could be called life, that is. Finally, the body itself, in which Georgiy had some... uh... scientific interest... I evaporated it."
536412, "What do you mean-evaporated? I've just received positive information that he's alive."
536413, "I turned him into the vaccine. I literally saturated the town with him. Maybe that is what's being implied by your.... source, whose identity I could guess? He lives on in the hearts of those for whom he gave his life. Didn't I explain it to your back then, four days ago? Do you still not understand?"
536414, "Katerina says that Simon is alive."
536415, "Thank you. Your word is sufficient."
536416, "No. You are a truly beautiful woman, Maria. "
536417, "Katerina is preparing an attack on you. She will use the imaginary murder of Simon to claim... that your family is who stands behind the plague."
536418, "...I am, en-Daniil. You are a man of honour. "
536419, "Maria, tell me... Maria, have you always been frank with me?"
536420, "You are the only person I've always been frank with, en-Daniil. This is probably because out meeting was so strange... and we have spent too little time together... You are the only one I've always been honest with... and I will keep being honest with you, en-Daniil. I don't want to lie to you."
536421, "Maria, tell me... Is it true that Simon is alive? "
536422, "...Not quite. It's complicated... But you're not going to believe me anyway... It's a pity that you've come to know our family at this horrible time. None of us is in tune with their true nature these days... Hopefully you haven't yet talked to... haven't been to the right wing. The wing where my father used to live."
536423, "What's going on with you all, Maria?"
536424, "You sound like a somnambulist-and remind me of Katerina."
536425, "All right. Talk to my dear... to my father. Just don't be surprised by anything. And do not ask unnecessary questions. He's a bit out of it... But they can... he can offer good advice."
536426, "Fine, I'll do just that."
536427, "I need to see Georgiy. Why is his door locked? "
536428, "I need explanations now. The accusations you family is facing are too grave."
536429, "We are innocent before our town. Nobody has ever done so much for the people as we have. Just wait some more until I awaken-and I shall explain it to you."
536430, "I trust you... But would those who want to see you fall do likewise?"
536431, "Our family is staring it in the face. The plague is an attack on us. It was us-not anyone else-who have become its main victims... You will see. Katerina already has... which is why she's running rampant... she's already lost her power. She has transferred it to someone else... and I don't mean Clara..."
536432, "...Katerina is also planning to seek the Inquisitor's support-and a trial for you..."
536433, "I see it would be better not to disturb you now."
536434, "Is it true that Simon Kain is alive? "
536435, "But what do you call life?"
536436, "Strange... Throughout my career, I've answered that question numerous times... but now I don't know what to tell you."
536437, "Do you believe in the soul's immortality?"
536438, "Yes, I do."
536439, "So you want to know the truth about Simon? So be it. You will. The truth is that Georgiy Kain, who so ardently desired eternal life for his brother, has committed himself in entirety to Simon's Memory. He is imbued completely with memories of him. That is what Katerina saw... but she is very sloppy with her visions."
536440, "Victor, I-"
536441, "Ha ha ha... forgive me this inappropriate laughter. I'm too unused to this. And I don't want to get used to it because this state will not continue for long. So you-"
536442, "I have heard that Simon Kain is alive. Is that true?"
536443, "What state? "
536444, "Do you know of that which we call Memory?"
536445, "Yes, I think I have the basic idea."
536446, "No. I don't believe in it."
536447, "Why, then, did you ask me that question about Simon?"
536448, "Katerina was in a frenzy. She is convinced that Simon is at The Crucible."
536449, "Ah, so that's why! Tell me, did Katerina only talk about Simon? Only him? And you say she was in a frenzy? Did she not notice the presence of another person at The Crucible, the very thought of whom should make the girl tremble?"
536451, "Life is any state of a human being that is different from death."
536452, "I'm not sure."
536453, "Memory is the very fine particles of a person that exist between that which is the person and all that isn't. Some have the ability to collect those particles. For as long as people are able to retain the particles inside themselves, the person is not dead. They remain here, but their soul is not imprisoned. It flies off to where it's supposed to be."
536454, "I understand now."
536459, "No. She spoke only of Simon"
536461, "I want to know where Simon Kain is now. "
536462, "...Who are you? "
536463, "You cannot know the answer to this question. Had my daughter not fallen in love with you, you wouldn't have been allowed to ask even the questions you've asked so far. Why have you come here, Bachelor Dankovsky?"
536464, "I want to know the truth about Simon. "
536466, "I think I'm beginning to understand..."
536467, "If Katerina starts spreading rumours of Simon's return, tell them Georgiy has gone mad. That he imagines himself to be Simon and Katerina is sensing those waves... Talk to Georgiy; let him confirm his consent to being presented as a madman."
536468, "Will he talk to me?"
536469, "...You really have no idea how much has changed. The cost of shutting up mouths is now several times greater."
536470, "Yes, you are exactly as I imagined. My boy, when Isidor described you to me... I knew that this is the way I would like my heir to be. Alas, I have never begotten one. I am not the first Kain to lack a son, and, regrettably, not the last."
536471, "Why? "
536472, "I think this is the price we pay for leaving too much life in our wake. Life that is lush, blooming, unpredictable and unrestrained. The soul that could have belonged to our children is dissolved in our man-made legacy."
536473, "You are a mystic. "
536474, "Are you not seeing what you expected to see?"
536475, "I want to know the truth about Simon Kain. "
536477, "I'm not a boy, Judge. You shouldn't attach so much significance to age differences."
536478, "Beyound a shadow of doubt, this is a man, not a boy standing before me. So why is this man here?"
536479, "Judge! There is rumour in the town that Simon is alive and his supposed death was a ruse set by the Kains to disguise their involvement in this plague outbreak."
536480, "Judge! There is rumour in the town that Simon is alive and his supposed death was a ruse set by the Kains to disguise their involvement in this plague outbreak."
536481, "To speak to you. Forgive my temper. "
536482, "What have you done to yourself, Judge? "
536483, "You know what I did; you will see if you look well enough. But that's not really the question, is it? What you really want to know is why."
536484, "Yes. "
536485, "No. I know why."
536486, "I do not know. For some reason it seems to me that this Changeling, Clara, can be of help here."
536487, "I have extremely valuable information. Where do you imagine Simon Kain currently is?"
536488, "Partly in heaven and partly in the ground, I suppose. Why? You have reason to believe otherwise?"
536489, "You should know that Georgiy Kain has gone insane. He believes himself to be Simon. He will possibly die soon. Victor too."
536490, "It seems to me that Simon is alive. "
536491, "I don't believe that. Out of the question. I don't even want to hear about it. Don't make me disappointed, I beg of you."
536493, "I have told you what I intended to.  Draw your own conclusions."
536494, "Is that so... Well, that changes everything. I will of course draw my own conclusions; in fact, I am doing so right now. The information is indeed extremely valuable. I will even allow myself to appraise their precise price tag. However, it wouldn't be very nice for two crafty people like us to outwit each other. Wouldn't you agree?"
536495, "The impression is all over the place, to be blunt."
536496, "I wholeheartedly agree. It's turning into a bedlam, wouldn't you agree? I can feel it here all too well-still can't get used to the piquancy of the whole ordeal... See for yourself-I've been thinking about leaving this place of the dead for a while now, but I get the feeling that this is exactly the place for me to fulfill my part..."
536497, "Why did you want to see me? "
536498, "To confirm your sharpest observation, actually... I've got competition now, as you can see. The lowest kind of it, I suppose. I am no tragedian myself-I'm rather a comedian-but this is a most grotesque and insane parody..."
536499, "And who is the competition?"
536500, "Some mob is trying to act out a... I'm not sure what to call it, it's not really a performance... well, they're trying to act out a living image of something by the Bone Stake. Although I'm not sure 'living' is the best word-the centerpiece is a dying creature, after all."
536501, "How is that competition?"
536502, "Everybody started to talk about it, interpreting and reinterpreting the... act. Just like they do with our very own Mask Act here. The prophetic excitement is growing by the hour... hand in hand with the anger."
536503, "Anger? What are they angry about?"
536504, "I don't know. I only have the Executors' sardonic reports at the moment. I wouldn't have bothered you with this if not for the nasty smell coming from the detestable farce... Because, honestly, who would really believe that it was my epigones' doing? The mob thinks it's a heavenly portent, no less."
536505, "Do you believe that I have gone mad? "
536506, "No. But you have changed-and I'm surprised."
536507, "I'm starting to think that I've been in a madhouse all this time."
536508, "You're asking as though you owned the situation... I find it disturbing."
536509, "Ah, I apologize... A nasty stage habit. Of course, I wouldn't in my wildest dreams dare... I wouldn't ever think about producing such a cheapjack and, if I may, tasteless play. So I had nothing to do with it. And let us forget the jests on the subject."
536510, "Why did you want to see me? "
536511, "Are they planning to lynch someone there once again?"
536512, "Did you see it? Was it impressive? "
536513, "What is it? What am I supposed to make of it? You just wanted me to see it, didn't you?"
536514, "Hmmm... First of all, I have to confess that this is not my handiwork; on the contrary, it's a direct attack on my interests. It never even occurred to me that this could make an impression on you-let alone a positive one-but I wanted you to see how impressed the mob is."
536515, "I'm afraid you're right. "
536516, "No. The set is too poor. Although the beast is real-I've checked."
536517, "There are several people there-each of them so noisy you could take them for a dozen."
536518, "I think the Kains are."
536519, "Actually, I don't care in the slightest. But you should. You are now at a timepoint when you cannot afford to not care-you've only got a day and a half left... I want that thing to end because I don't like their style. What about you?"
536520, "I do indeed care. It's dangerous. "
536521, "But how can they be removed from there?"
536522, "I'd rather like to know who had arranged it."
536523, "Why are you asking me? I wonder! Which irredeemable blockhead has gotten it into their blocky head to arrange such a performance? I don't know! I only know it resembles a bulldog throwing a recently-strangled cat on a festive table! The owners' beloved cat, I might add..."
536524, "You? "
536525, "Oh please... Do you still view me in my former quality? No, I am no longer a mime show interpreter. That's too good for me. I voluntarily-you hear that? Voluntarily!-renounce the laurels of a destiny-maker. Except maybe a bit-for fun... eh?"
536526, "Who do you think fits the description best?"
536527, "Well, I don't. I've been embroiled into a stupid melodrama already-and now you want to embroil me into a farce? No way in hell."
536528, "I don't know... I think it will resolve by itself somehow. And I have more pressing concerns."
536529, "Who is the target then?"
536530, "Of course it's not."
536531, "Let's hear what the smart man has to say."
536532, "You are probably right."
536533, "I sincerely hope you can. I have to admit-I'm furious. The directive I received from the top brass gave me very broad authority and the right to make strategic decisions. It made no mention of an inquisitor! And now this..."
536534, "What? "
536535, "That is still unresolved. For many years now it has been an unspoken rule for military command to obey the decisions of an inquisitor. The justification was that an inquisitor would find a way to make a soldier obey their will anyway-whether the latter knows it or not."
536536, "To be fair, until very recently, military commanders also left remarkably little room for illusions concerning themselves..."
536537, "But it's all different now! I am willing to cooperate, but she refuses to even meet with me. She has gathered information, not without your assistance I imagine, and now she's busy setting the gears in motion, waving me away until my gear is up for turning!"
536538, "What are you responsible for, commander?"
536539, "I hasten to report an issue of an utmost importance. There is a riot brewing in the poor districts."
536540, "Let the Inquisitor deal with that. Riots are right up her alley. I wish no part in it. She won't share information with me, so I won't step onto her turf. I'm not being vindictive. I'd hate to disturb her arrangements."
536541, "Certain special circumstances are in play, ones directly related to you responsibilities."
536542, "No... something tells me that the Inquisitor will not deal with it."
536543, "What is the scope of your duties?"
536544, "I am responsible for ensuring that the epidemic never spreads from here further. I am also responsible for the lives of my men. That is what I know for a fact."
536545, "Your flamethrower corps are burning out everything infected, whether it moves or not. Is that within the scope of their jurisdiction?"
536546, "There is a giant decaying animal carcass in the middle of the poorer districts. Do you realize the consequences?"
536548, "I do."
536549, "Absolutely."
536550, "It's in the Bone Stake Lot-I see it marked on your map."
536551, "Many interesting things for them to see on the Bone Stake Lot. I'd lead them in that particular direction if I were you."
536552, "I understand you completely, commander. This is exactly what I wanted. Everyone performing their duty."
536553, "No. The vigilante is a much more significant woman."
536554, "I fear only one woman in this town. And if she chooses to try for my life, so long me. But I don't think she would use such extravagant means to achieve that end."
536555, "Her name is Yulia Lyuricheva. She suffers from a neurotic condition."
536556, "Fine. I'll send riflemen there immediately. Let her be under house arrest until I have time to make a closer acquaintance. "
536557, "Yes. She is a singer, very eccentric. She often fails to realise where she is and mostly lives inside her own fantasy world."
536558, "This woman has the intellect and willpower of a man. The owner of the Trammel manor, on the bluff in the Chine district."
536559, "One more thing. The... gentler half of the town community is already... abuzz with the news. So should any overexcited lady come here... "
536560, "I understand. She will be treated with utmost respect. I will talk to her and do my best to set her right. But if she turns violent, she will be locked up."
536561, "We have-but it's all very sudden. Somehow I can't shake the feeling you knew beforehand..."
536562, "I'm not. It's all very clear."
536563, "It's all clear as day. "
536564, "In the Bone Stake Lot?"
536565, "In the Bone Stake Lot."
536566, "No. I know nothing about it. "
536567, "She is a witch. The Dark Mistress. Have you already heard about Nina and Victoria? Ask around. Then you'll see who Maria strives to be. She will turn into a warlock queen and make the town bend before her tyranny. Like Nina before her, only even more frightening. It can be proven."
536568, "Tell me about Nina. "
536569, "Nina was the embodiment of absolute evil. The charming, intoxicating, beautiful evil, the evil that can drive you mad. The graceful and elegant evil that is fast to capture anyone in its web-even those who stand up to evil till the very last."
536570, "'Pray forgive me,' as one of our common friends likes to say. Quite a lot of outrageous events happened yesterday..."
536571, "Yes. Someone tried to incite a riot."
536572, "The military have exterminated an unarmed mob. A perfectly healthy mob. This is the event I'm talking about. And I know for sure who was behind it-because I know who turned out to be guilty of this horrible crime... me! I was the one they framed!"
536573, "So who was behind it?"
536574, "The Kains, most likely. They have arranged this provocation and tied every loose end to me-as though it was I who's done it. They've done a splendid job. I couldn't have done better. That's because such things can only be done by a very special woman... it's about genetics as much as it is about skill..."
536575, "Maria? "
536576, "I think we understand each other full well, Inquisitor. Everyone was doing their job. Everyone only knew what they were supposed to know. Supposed by you."
536577, "You are mistaken. It was me."
536578, "You? No. You only provided the military with the information... that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about those who have orchestrated this... mysteria. Undoubtedly, it was Maria. And this Mark, the impresario of the local Theatre, has given her a cue as to how."
536579, "This is beyond Maria's capabilities. "
536580, "Yesterday she was unconscious all day long. "
536581, "Are you trying to say you're painting Maria's portrait? Considering they're supposedly alike?"
536582, "Who is it? "
536583, "Olgimsky's son. The second is Maria's younger brother, little Kaspar, who also knows Maria's immediate plans better than anyone else. He is so terrified of them that he's ready to run to the ends of the earth..."
536584, "This is interesting... "
536585, "By the way, if you want to talk to this Kaspar boy, please hand this panacea over to him. This vial was brought to me by Burakh yesterday, it's reliable. The boy will understand. Actually, after talking to him so will you..."
536586, "Damn... Me dealing with Olgimsky turned out to be so untimely..."
536587, "Who are you talking about, boy? "
536588, "You should know that better than me. I am not going to help you with this."
536589, "You hold a grudge against your sister? Why? "
536590, "Sister forces us out from here. "
536591, "Why? "
536592, "You ask her! "
536593, "Who was it built for then?"
536594, "Not for you, that much is certain. At least I'd like to think so."
536595, "Tell me, is your sister involved into what happened yesterday in the Stake Lot?"
536596, "No. But she's involved into many other things. For example, it was she who got rid of Eva. How's that for news, huh? She wanted to have you all for herself. I could tell you a lot about my sister... but I don't want to flaunt the dirty linen."
536597, "Take the panacea. This is for you. "
536598, "Aglaya Lilich asked me to give you this. "
536599, "I do not want to have anything to do with with Aglaya Lilich. "
536600, "It's a panacea. "
536601, "It was she who put down the bull in the Bone Stake Lot yesterday, wasn't it?"
536603, "So no Kain has anything to do with what happened in the Lot?"
536605, "If you tell me what she is up to, perhaps I'll be able to help you."
536606, "Simon. It is for his sake that father and uncle are throwing away their lives. Well, I don't believe in all that metempsychosis! And this is the only place where we can play for real. This is our childhood. We are not giving it away to anyone!"
536607, "And that's all? Pfft. No one would remove you from here until the disease is over."
536608, "And when it is? Then what?"
536609, "Take the panacea. It's for you. Let us not meet ever again."
536610, "How do you know about Eva? "
536611, "Ask my sister. She knows how to do these things. She won't lie to you. She'll tell the truth."
536612, "Eva has committed suicide and left a note."
536613, "I'll tell the Inquisitor that you by any stretch of imagination cannot acknowledge the complicity of your relatives to the Lot situation-against your personal preferences. Is that correct?"
536614, "It is. Now no one will claim that I'm only saying that to protect my family."
536615, "Yes, I have already realized what your position is."
536616, "He is alive and well."
536617, "Yes, of course. It was ugly. Burakh is beside himself. "
536618, "Do the Kains have anything to do with it?"
536619, "Wait a minute... No, this can't be. The Kains were within a hair's breadth of destruction. The bull situation was arranged to smear their name and set the people against them. Who gave you this... unique idea? Because I can't believe that you've come to this conclusion on your own via logical inference."
536620, "Aglaya thinks Maria did it."
536621, "This is your love for her speaking."
536622, "No. The nature of my love for her allows me to justify any installation of hers in any lot. Let her build everything she deems necessary! Because sooner or later Maria will construct the space for magic to return to. There's nothing more beautiful than the expectation of a miracle. "
536623, "Doesn't sound very Olgimsky, to be honest."
536624, "My father never loved me-so I have no desire to pursue his lifework. I will revere him as I did before, but the family business... is no more. Little sister is right. The powers switch places."
536625, "I promised to give this to you. It's a panacea. "
536626, "Well. Does this mean Maria had nothing to do with the yesterday's accident? "
536627, "She hadn't. But even if she had-what of it? Would it have changed anything?"
536628, "I'll relay your words to the Inquisitor. "
536629, "Why are you telling me this?"
536630, "My daughter had two final wishes. To talk to her mother, and to visit the other two chrysales. She can do neither now. I don't think she will ever talk to her mother again. But she must see the future Mistresses.They must acknowledge her."
536631, "Is there anything I can do to help?"
536632, "Someone needs to take the symbols of succession from these 'chrysales'. They know what this is about because they can also feel this awakening. It is very much possible that Capella knows who has inherited the title of Katerina, the usurping Mistress of the Earth. She was, after all, the leader of one of the powers while we were dead."
536633, "But why are you asking me?"
536634, "Maria did. She specifically pointed out that she didn't want a stranger's hand to touch the rings that will forever adorn her body."
536635, ""
536636, "Oh how ferocious Mother Nature is! For 'tis her wrath that has to be withstood... Oh friend, if only I could wet my whistle... I'd gladly give you anything on earth in exchange for a gulp of chilly spring water!"
536638, "How about we barter? You'll have your water and I'll have bandages."
536639, "Do you need a drink, you poor soul? How about some water?"
536640, "You want to barter? We are a poor lot, but we'd fork out something for a good man, a kind man, a big-hearted man... like a fork! Yeah! A fork!"
536641, "Here you go then."
536642, "Do you have bandages-or something else that one can dress wounds with? Give them to me. They're of no use to you anyway."
536643, "I'll give all my water to you! And you... can you give me something to stop the bleeding? I'm injured, you see..."
536644, "Now we barter, drifter man. I brought you some water. "
536645, "Why don't you drink from the river then?"
536646, "Only lowly animals, dirty of image, drink from the river. Us proud men deserve to drink spring water... 'Tis brought here in barrels, but they're often empty. I'd get it from there, but I'm out of bottles; I'd drink straight out of a fountain, but I'm gonna faint... the air here's too spicy. I'm barely walking as it is."
536647, "So the local herbs are in bloom this time of year?"
536648, "They're not blooming, professor, they're withering... Withering and thence producing general langour. People fall dead without sleep like leaves from a branch... All because of the surplus of juices. Or maybe not-I'm not really a science guy..."
536649, "So you're a student? "
536650, "Oh no, I'm but a woeful wretch, professor... A wretch that had suffered all too much."
536651, "My condolences."
536652, "Why don't you shut up then?"
536653, "So you've got an Abattoir in the town? What is it?"
536654, "It is with great trepidation that I set about to answer your question, professor. The Abattoir has been here since nothing else was. And mark my word-here it will remain when nothing else does. For 'tis all vanity of vanities, and all is vanity. "
536655, "Do switch your silver tongue for a tongue more common, kind sir."
536656, "Hundreds of bulls are being slaughtered there-what else is there to know? It is our humble town that provides the whole Northeastern Region with beef! Or even the whole country, mayhap. How many poor bull souls does it take to stuff the belly of a country that has millions upon millions of citizens? Eh?"
536657, "Your humble river obviously also supplies the whole country with water..."
536658, "A lot. "
536659, "Why trepidate?"
536660, "My trepidation comes from uncertainty and confusion, professor. The Abattoir instills fear, for what is it if not a temple of death? An operational one, mind you, unlike the town Cathedral on Bridge Square..."
536661, "Operational?"
536662, "You are a lowly animal. Dirty of image, too. Drink from the river."
536663, "You are a suspicious crowd... Your mugs scream of penal labour! Each of you is a murderer-to-be! What, am I wrong?"
536664, "So what? Did you find out whose guise the shabnak assumed yesterday?"
536665, "What? Who are you calling a shabnak?"
536666, "It's not a 'who'. It's a 'what'. A living myth. The Steppe people believe that a shabnak is not human at all, but rather a wandering soul; a state of evil-and 'tis among us that it walks. Bottoms up, buddy! Have a drink! That'll clear your head up."
536667, "I am absolutely amazed that you people can believe in things like this while simultaneously having the capability to use a railroad."
536668, "'N what is wrong with that, eh? Life is a complicated matter, it can't be catalogued. You think we're all savages here, making a fuss about a fairytale?"
536669, "Hardly."
536670, "We're breathing Steppe here. Oh, the vapours that evaporate from it! The Steppe is wiser-no railroad can conceal it. Eh, the necromancers shouldn't have pinned their hopes on you. It requires a knack rather than intelligence... You don't believe in the shabnak-and it has just passed you by."
536671, "I'll find my way around it somehow."
536672, "Yes, the air here is unhealthy. My eyes are about to burst from the fragrance. "
536673, "This is exactly what I think, yes."
536674, "Thank you, but I'll pass."
536675, "I didn't. Tell me, what do they store in the local warehouses?"
536676, "The mortal remains of the late animals are in the southern part, as well as hide and ground bones. Jerked meat, cured meat, smoked meat, canned meat-all storaged and ready to go. The southern part of the Warehouses is a giant bull mortuary. So it is!"
536677, "And what about the northern part? "
536678, "The nothern part is house to consumable junk. The regular train comes regularly, as is evident by the name, bringing fancy goods to our neck of the woods. Pants and snaps, chemicals and perfume, all them thingamajigs... 'Tis essentially another mortuary, for everyday life is the killer of spirit... "
536679, "Aren't you a philosopher! "
536680, "A woesome rag I am; I'm walking ashes; a freak devoid of grace. As are we all... Do not take yourself too seriously, and you will learn the truth. Bottoms up, brother! The grass is wiser than we are!"
536681, "As for you, do try to just take yourself for granted, kind sir. Stop being so hard on yourself."
536682, "Yes, the picture you've painted is spot-on."
536683, "Thank you."
536684, "Someone mentally unsound. Or a soaker like you. "
536685, "Well? What's the news around the town?"
536686, "Vanity of vanities! All is vanity! Take the Polyhedron, that's become a children's game now... 'Tis lovely children that reside there now; they've weaved a nest among the deadly tines of the machine-like charming singing birds... But not for them the Tower's been conceived, but for the glory of the benefactors. The family of them philantropists!"
536687, "What family are you talking about? "
536688, "The Kains, stricken down with bitter grief these days... who else? For 'twas another purpose that their project was intended for... The purpose without notice having lost, it stands abandoned now. And so it will until the end of days."
536689, "What was it intended for?"
536690, "Damned if I know... not for the mortal life, that's filled with honest sweat, with mundane pain, and transient jealousy. There was a lofty purpose that is unknown to me. A purpose unfulfilled. A dream! Yessir!"
536691, "Pah! Words, words, words... you're just saying words-while having absolutely no idea what you're talking about."
536692, "Okay. Tell me, is any of your mates sick with a strange disease?"
536693, "Our souls are sick... Mine, and those of my friends. A sickness both contagious and lethal... the sickness unto death."
536694, "Thank you. That would be enough. "
536695, "Isn't time endless? Why do you even think there is an end to days?"
536696, "Isn't there? If not today or tomorrow, it surely will come... someday. I'm planning to drag my miserable existence for at least forty more years here. "
536697, "Let's hope that you will."
536698, "People like you are a pointless burden to the world anyway."
536699, "Tell me about the Spleen district. "
536700, "'Tis in the Knots, which would be the middle part of the Town of Men. The Spleen flanks the Station from northwest, stretching along the tributary; and the tributary's called the Guzzle. All them spleens and guzzling are quite intricate, ain't they? Heh heh..."
536701, "That's fine. I'm good at anatomy. I'm a trained specialist, after all."
536702, "Which is exactly what we're hoping for...! So what's up with Simon? They say he's... not entirely dead? That would be logical: we're alive, so our father must also be..."
536703, "I haven't examined him yet. "
536704, "Simon is dead. "
536705, "Indeed. Never in my life have I seen a trickier topography."
536706, "Top-o'-what? Well, anyway... You've asked, I've answered. No one's at the top o' anything. We're equals."
536707, "Thank you."
536708, "I think I'm very much at the top!"
536709, "A common occurrence."
536710, "What are you reeking of, my good man? Is this some kind of sap?"
536711, "Aye, twyrine sap it is... And let me tell you, the twyre gathered at the Flabby Mud last year had extraordinary properties, truly extraordinary!"
536712, "Really? What were they?"
536713, "Here's what I think. A herb is like a person-each blade has its own character. The bouquet has to be collected carefully, like a family, bloom to bloom-and the proportion, mind the proportion!-but water is also important. You can't just take any water."
536714, "Yes! Tell me about the water, my good man. What kind of water do you have here? "
536715, "We all live off Steppe juices. Twyre the herb draws its juices from the Steppe; sun draws its juices from twyre; so does a bull, who gives and takes away-so does a man, a sinful worm, who sucks the earth out for his needs. The juices of a body are a gift-and the key to understanding everything!"
536716, "Where do you draw water from? "
536717, "The Steppe grants us water. Each spring has a different kind: one of them is filling, another's joyful, and the third one may be evil..."
536718, "Evil? How?"
536719, "'Tis no good drinking the Sugagh water, professor. Whenever anyone offers you a glass of water, take the lovely dove shritfront and inquire as to whether the water's been taken from Sugagh. And if they confess that it has, stuff that water down their throat, for 'tis a sin to blight an honest man with it. Evil comes from that water. Not the pest, just... evil."
536720, "What kind of water does Gorkhon produce? "
536721, "The common kind... Dirty. "
536722, "I see."
536723, "What kind of evil? "
536724, "Bad fortune, here's what kind. Whoever drinks that water, dies not their own death. That's a reliable omen, I'm telling you. Beware of that water, doctor. You never know-what if you drink it? And next thing you know, your demise is waiting just around the corner."
536725, "Superstition, nothing more."
536726, "Do you know who's destroyed the town waterpipe? "
536727, "No... Shady business. Everyone's been asked and no one knows. Who would destroy it but the one that craves our demise? It must have been Shabnak the bloodsucker."
536728, "I see. One theory less then."
536729, "Empty talk..."
536730, "Tell me about the Flank district, good man. "
536731, "'Tis adjoined to the middle of the Knots from northwest. In simpler words 'tis the western edge of the middle cape. The Shelter, the Ravels' mansion, is there. Why d'ya ask?"
536732, "Who are the Ravels? "
536733, "A shady family. There used to be a captain Ravel here-the only military man in the entire town, but he was worth a battalion, if you ask me. He snapped a bull with his bare hands once. Used to hit nine bottles out of eight from fifty steps away. A tough man he was..."
536734, "Did he die?"
536735, "Killed in the war, or so they say... In the war, but not in the field. There are rumours aplenty. And now his daughter Lara, a xenial and cordial orphan, lives in The Shelter. An angelic lady, pure and worthy of most sincere compassion!"
536736, "Thank you."
536737, "Why did you call the Ravels shady then?"
536738, "For I am rotten! 'Tis all my foul tongue striving to tittle and tattle. But your reproach is just, professor, and so I will be keeping mum from now on. Not a single vicious word shall escape my lips. And as for the departed, 'tis all nonsense!"
536739, "What departed?"
536740, "What departed? I never said a word about departed people! No one departs anything. 'Tis all baby talk and superstition. And now I have to take my leave, professor. Here's your hat, so to speak, and what's your hurry? Goodbye and good riddance."
536741, "You tattler. "
536742, "Fine. You'll sing like a bird later anyway."
536743, "Well done! "
536744, "I see. Nine out of eight is a rare feat."
536745, "No reason. Just curious."
536746, "Everything here is extraordinary. "
536747, "What are you mumbling there?"
536748, "Dark times are upon us... The town is dying... For it was written: Water shall become blood like that of a dead man. True. Blood spills faster than water. And the body shall be desecrated; and the children shall rise up against their parents."
536749, "Tell me, have you seen the Ripper?"
536750, "I've seen more than one ripper... Do you look in the mirror often, professor?"
536751, "I'm talking about Artemy Burakh. He looks somewhat wild and wears a leather robe."
536752, "I've heard about Artemy Burakh. Is he a ripper though? Nay, professor... He's a haruspex. He belongs to the respected Burakh family. It's not the same as cutting mongrels, it means something. Although if you really need a mongrel cut..."
536753, "Do you know where he can be found?"
536754, "He settled down at the Works, on the outskirts of the town. Either in the boiler-house or in the power-house... That's where he is, kind sir. But I would like to add, if I may, that he belongs not to a rough cellar, but rather to a halfpace."
536755, "What halfpace?"
536756, "I knew his father, professor. He was a most worthy man. It is due to Isidor's good will that Foreman Oyun rather than the Haruspex is the current leader of the Kin and the taskmaster of the Abattoir. For Isidor had a relish for healing and learning rather than power..."
536757, "Yes, I knew Isidor."
536758, "So he's in a remote factory building, huh..."
536759, "I see. Dismissed."
536760, "Watch it! I'm not too slow on the draw, you know! Be off."
536761, "Tell me about the Backbone district. Where is it? Any points of interest there?"
536762, "It's in the Knots, by the wall. That's where the Town Hall is. The common opinion goes that it's the most useless district of them all. A district of dimwits. My Pa, rest his soul in peace, used to say just that: a district of dimwits. Never allowed little me to be there so that I wouldn't pick their stupidity up... "
536763, "Really? Your father seems like a most honourable person..."
536764, "He was a sot, so help me, a thief, and a waste of skin! Cursed like a she-dog, drank away all our money, and ruined my pure-hearted Ma through his wretchedness!"
536765, "The son is a success though!"
536766, "That's disheartening... "
536767, "Doesn't seem like your father's benevolent urges were of any use..."
536768, "Do not despair."
536769, "Speak up-who is spreading the infection? Look me in the eye!"
536770, "I swear on my soul's salvation-it wasn't me! Not my fault! You know it's a maneater, a shabnak, a creature of feminine gender-and do you see any, ahem, lady parts on my person? Eh! And so I plead not guilty!"
536771, "So you're claiming innocence, my dear wretch?"
536772, "Oh no, I'm far from innocent! Sinful, so sinful! I have commited many an infamy-but none so grievous as being a shabnak, a carrier! Who told you it was me?"
536773, "No one did, you blockhead. "
536774, "It is truly as they say: look for the woman! Nude, inviting, vicious-'tis always a woman. And many-faced, as has been written. For it is in the nature of a woman. They say the shabnak has also turned into a puny maiden! And lewd too, yessir..."
536775, "Whys are you so nervous? You can only be taken for a lewd woman with serious reserve."
536776, "So what... You never know... You have approached me, and I am paralyzed with fear already. You know what they call you, professor? 'The Harbinger of Death.' Like an avenging angel on serpent wings, he hath spoken and rained destruction upon the sinful place! That's how it's been prophesized."
536777, "Try singing another song."
536778, "Stop squirming, you feathers-on-a-snout! I have approached you to barter for bangages."
536779, "I am not an inquisitor. You will report your courageous exploits to them when they arrive."
536780, "Is that delirium tremens speaking?"
536781, "No one suspects you, idiot. "
536782, "Have you seen any of the birdmask people nearby?"
536783, "Executors! They took to hiding behind masks, fancy that... Never mind that they seem to appear on every corner. So a birdface sneaks up to you-and then what? How do you know who's hiding behind it? It may be a friend, it may be a foe. It may be my death! Go figure... "
536784, "And who do they turn out to be most often?"
536785, "Opinions vary on that one... To hell with them! I spit on their accursed lot. They bring corpses and bad news. I do not want to know who would be interested in labour this hard. A performance, dang it! I've always hated theatre..."
536786, "Still, I hope that they are human. Why do they dress like that? "
536787, "An overall and a mask are good protection, they say... 'Tis true. I've seen a lot of deadmen in my life-none of them were wearing an overall and a mask. But maybe the disease is indeed spread by vermin? What do you think, mate?"
536788, "I am not your mate."
536789, "Uh huh. By vermin and sermons."
536790, "That is glaringly obvious."
536791, "You'd be better off helping them rather that putting yourself at risk uselessly. "
536792, "How come this place never runs out of you sots... You've been ordered to stay in!"
536793, "That's what I'm saying! Drunks are always lucky, as the folk wisdom goes. It's the same here, too-how can the bacteria survive inside you when you're pouring so much twyrine down your throat?"
536794, "Why do you think it's a bacteria?"
536795, "What else could it be? What else is causing them fevers? The dire beast called microbe. Shaggy in image, fangy in jaws, scary in manner. Smallish in size though, which is a relief. Has a knack for reproduction. Am I right, professor?"
536796, "It is most likely a virus, and no spirit is deep enough to drown it."
536797, "You are of course an educated man. A man of academia, so to speak. But I would argue otherwise. Take my father-in-law. Drank like a fish-a fish that would then crawl under the table mindlessly-and no plague would get to him. Never! Not to mention flu. Five years ago when it happened for the first time he survived."
536798, "No way..."
536799, "Oh, but there is a way! Having imbibed a good measure of twyrine in the morning, he dived into a house taken over by the Sand Plague-for reasons entirely humanitarian, I might add! And then he came back alive, unscathed by the pest, and he is still alive to this day... Yessir... "
536800, "Twyrine seems to be a versatile beverage."
536801, "There goes the gospel truth! Twyrine is a unique beverage. Liquid emerald. It has all kinds of healing and enlightening properties."
536802, "Undoubtedly."
536803, "Your father-in-law must have been lucky."
536804, "It's a coincidence."
536805, "Go, sleep yourself sober. 'Professor...' "
536806, "I have no idea how you can drink this... venom. "
536807, "'Tis a hebon that makes you live twice as long."
536808, "I doubt that."
536809, "One life you live is your own, another is the one twyre grants you. This is a herb greener than wormwood, it is, professor. Have a specimen for your microscope. It will be more accessible to you then. And my microscope is a spirit still..."
536810, "I can see that. It's a shame it's not as precise as mine. "
536811, "I have noticed mass mental instability among the local population. It is not impossible that it's caused by the abundance of poisonous plants."
536812, "Why not thrice? "
536813, "You can't put spirits in your veins instead of blood, though."
536814, "I think I've heard shooting. Have you? What happened there?"
536815, "Them military men do not take kindly to our brethren! It would be unwise to come close to the bridges now. They shoot straight. Why did they have to block the bridges? Huh? I'm asking you!"
536816, "Why in the world are you asking me? Do you think they're doing it on my orders?"
536817, "Well, uh... you're an authority. You're supposed to know things, hence me asking."
536818, "Do not provoke the soldiers and they won't hurt you. "
536819, "Let them not provoke us and we won't hurt them. Here's this sod with his gun, protecting the state and civil order from me, wasting bullets... from his rifle, no less! I can stand up for myself, yessir! Their lives are no more valuable than ours."
536820, "His bullet will get to you sooner than your swearing gets to him."
536821, "True. "
536822, "You idiot..."
536823, "What is there to take kindly to, you useless sods?"
536824, "Nothing, okay, fine. We're but a humble crowd. But why hurt them cultured people? They've sent a squad of flamethrower men-with flamethrowers, fuel, and everything. They're planning to assault the pub!"
536825, "Why? "
536826, "They want to capture Andrey, the architect. But we shall not give him out! "
536827, "What for?"
536828, "For being too tough. He gave the bastards the works yesterday! He's shown them that letting your fists loose can be a bad idea. No more abuse towards artists!"
536829, "If only."
536830, "Serves you right. "
536831, "You'll find a way to deal with it."
536832, "I don't know. "
536833, "May I ask as to why you are so happy?"
536834, "'Hail to the powerful and healthy storm,' as they used to say. The times of change are truly upon us. The old will topple down for the new to be erected."
536835, "Your optimism is untimely. What's the point?"
536836, "We're trying to escape the absurdity of it all, professor. There is a point to everything; everything happens for a reason. All those deaths couldn't have been for nothing. That's what I think. Through cleansing and suffering a new bliss will emerge."
536837, "Really? You couldn't have come up with that on your own."
536838, "Hmm... True. 'Twas a girl comforter, a puny lass that wiped away our tears. She comforted me yesterday. Without abhorring us down-and-outs. She said, 'Everything happens for a reason; all those deaths couldn't have been...' Eh! She speaks the truth."
536839, "Forget it, you sot. The recent war had swept away way more lives than this plague. People have always died and will always die by the millions. 'For nothing.'"
536840, "What a nice girl. "
536841, "Yes, definitely. "
536842, "Too good to be true. "
536843, "What's the word on the street? Is no one preparing for the evacuation?"
536844, "It is the truth they say about the world transforming! Yessir! It will transform, surrendering our mortal coils devoured by the soil to build a brave new world, all shimmering and gleaming! And we'll become the ground from which the joy will grow and bloom... and fume its odour sweet."
536845, "Hopefully you will live to see it. Don't be too fast to bury yourself."
536846, "No, we shall perish soon. We ragged freaks had it coming. There is no place for us in the new worlds. We're obsolete!"
536847, "Yes, this is true. "
536848, "A mentality like this definitely spells doom."
536849, "Nothing but burdocks will grow from you. This is scientifically proven. "
536850, "Nothing I can help you with."
536851, "Well, let me have a look... Stand still. What is this bulging cartilage? "
536852, "You really shouldn't walk outside at a time like this. It will come to no good..."
536853, ""
536854, "Hey you! Don't you mess with us. We know a thing or two about life."
536855, "Let's barter, lad. I have a lot of curious things. "
536856, "Why are you so bristled up? "
536857, "It has begun! A crushing blow to the Soul-and-a-Halves is being prepared. There are almost seventy Dogheads. No one will escape their doom! "
536858, "What does it mean? "
536859, "It means the end of the Soul-and-a-Halves' domination in Earth. Notkin will have to sweat to break free from the dogs' jaws! "
536860, "Are you describing a game of yours?"
536861, "A game to some, destiny to others. "
536862, "I hope you avoid manslaughter. "
536863, "Do keep in mind that I have no part in the conflict. "
536864, "Who is Notkin? "
536865, "You will know when the time comes. If he's still alive by then, that is."
536866, "I hope you're talking about a game. "
536867, "Who are the Soul-and-a-Halves and the Dogheads?"
536868, "The Soul-and-a-Halves have a soul and a half, and the Dogheads have dog heads. As you can see, it's a clash of ideas; a matter of principle. It's an us-or-them situation. There will be no mercy. "
536869, "You've got some fierce games."
536870, "Why the long face?"
536871, "The war's been postponed. If it has come to this, we shall unite and hunt the turnskin."
536872, "Do you belive in turnskins? "
536873, "You graduated from a university, and this is your question...? You think we're all total nitwits here? Looking for a werewolf? Werewolves only exist in fairytales. And a real turnskin would make you own skin crawl..."
536874, "Sound intriguing. Tell me more!"
536875, "Do you know the Baur Meges? The book of Steppe legends? It explains what a turnskin is. A turnskin can live by your side for years-and then all of a sudden-bam!-it turns! Don't be surprised then that your nearest and dearest are on their way to the cemetery. "
536876, "But why? "
536877, "Because that's the turnskin's nature. It was a man or a woman, then-bam!-there's a kagi standing before you. Death emanates from it. You geddit now, you big-city brainy?"
536878, "More or less."
536879, "Mind your manners, young man."
536880, "No, I am not an expert on the Steppe lore. "
536881, "I hope you know what you're doing. "
536882, "It is good that at least the war is postponed. "
536883, "If Khan and Notkin come to an agreement, that is. Notkin is proud, and Khan is fierce. "
536884, "Hopefully they do."
536885, "What's the news in the town?"
536886, "Someone's plundered our old powder caches! Who could it be? "
536887, "You had powder?"
536888, "Not powder. Powders. Powders-shmowders... We used to play Plague. Naturally the game demanded that we steal medicine. Then we arranged Drugstores and produced Recipes; competed at who invents the best one. All in all, a couple of recipes turned out to be fine... I mean, the kids that took those shmowders survived."
536889, "Good for them."
536890, "You don't geddit! They've survived the Sand Pest! You know what it does with your blood? It makes it boil in your veins like an egg in a pot. First it runs thick, then it turns into clots like cottage cheese. How do you like that? And shmowders did help!"
536891, "Where can I find these... powders? "
536892, "Hah! I'd never tell you even if I knew."
536893, "Could I study the recipe and replicate them?"
536894, "Could you? Are you for real? "
536895, "I am."
536896, "I could relay that to our guys... If they come across some, I'll tell them to keep the shmowders for you. But don't count on it too much; shmowders are unique and hard to come by."
536897, "I won't."
536898, "No, that was a joke. Ha bloody ha."
536899, "That was to be expected from you, lad. Now shoo!"
536900, "That's bollocks."
536901, "What caches? "
536902, "Caches! The Mild Dew's been looted! Cuckoo said someone's pillaged his cache too. But the worst thing is that Silly House has also been sacked clean. Who can tell now which shmowders are good and which are Catchfly's? If you eat the latter, you're toast-you can just as well wash them down with acid!"
536903, "Sounds horrible... "
536904, "Is everything all right with you, you little rapscallion? "
536905, "A neighbour of ours has been killed by patrolmen! I still can't wrap my head around it... That means they can make away with me just as easily. And with you too..."
536906, "What did they kill him for?"
536907, "Well... They say he attacked someone too. He did have quite a temper, but they beat him to death with their mega fists! By the way, was there really an order to do that? For reals? How do we fight now, how do we defend our honour?"
536908, "The order was issued to put a stop to the chaos."
536909, "Pfft... Right... Good luck with that! You keep in mind that we can stand up for ourselves just fine! If anyone hurts me, my Dina, or any of my friends, or Capella-they will be in big big trouble! My fists are in the right place too, ya know! Got it?"
536910, "Why are you shouting at me? Do I look like a patrolman?"
536911, "Just don't go running rampant too soon."
536912, "You people should stay indoors to protect yourself from the epidemiological hazard, not go around fighting!"
536913, "Wha-?"
536914, "Close your mouth, you'll eat a fly."
536915, "I said, stay in!"
536916, "Why are you sticking like a leech to me? "
536917, "Tell me, are you a doctor? "
536918, "Well... Yes."
536919, "So you have a bandage? A tourniquet, any bandaging material? "
536920, "What do you need it for?"
536921, "Huh! 'What for'! How is that even a question? What do you think is the most useful thing in a fight? What if you're bleeding or your joint's been dislocated? How do you fight a war without bandages? And they're nowhere to be found..."
536922, "Come on, we've been there before... Stop this inane war of yours! Go home and stay in until aid arrives!"
536923, "Until aid arrives? When would that be? And what are we supposed to eat? Huh? There's no bread in the town-and now there's no water too... 'Stay in,' he says... You must be eating healthy and nutritious food, ain't you? Got yourself some nice chow, don't you, sir Bachelor, sir?"
536924, "You moron."
536925, "It will arrive soon. Have patience. "
536926, "And why are they nowhere to be found?"
536927, "Olgimsky, the leech, has collected all the medicine in the town and is now partly distributing it among those who are in need... And the tourniquets go to the patrolmen."
536928, "I see."
536929, "No. Bandages I have none."
536930, "No. I'm a scientist. "
536931, "Where do you think you're going?"
536932, "Fuck it! The town is a motherfucking mess! Grab your knives, everyone! I'm done! Seems like the old taboos are as good as gone. Well, ciao, motherfuckers! Every man for himself now."
536933, "What are you talking about?"
536934, "What, are you blind? Going outside is like diving into flame now. You're lucky if you can hold for three minutes, from one door to another."
536935, "If you start stabbing people, there'll be no mercy for you. I mean you as a community."
536936, "Ha... Like there's ever been any. Why don't you shut up... bachelor."
536937, "Stay in! Everything is being delivered to you-both provisions and medicine. The sanitary train will arrive soon."
536938, "Yeah, when pigs fly!"
536939, "It will come soon."
536940, "Don't you talk back at me."
536941, "..."
536942, "Cut it with the strong language immediately! You little prick!"
536943, "What's the news, lad? "
536944, "It's definitely a good thing that the children are holed up in the Tower. Is it true that there have been no fatal outcomes there?"
536945, "I don't know. I haven't been there. "
536946, "I'm afraid it may collapse under the weight though. So many people have never gathered there at the same time... "
536947, "And how many did? "
536948, "Well... A hundred, a hundred and fifty maybe... But there's never been more than a thousand."
536949, "Is that so! That means I've got one more pain in the neck now-the construcrion sheltering a thousand children may collapse any minute. Damn it to bloody hell!"
536950, "Oh, it's not like that... Don't you worry... It must have been designed to hold them, probably... And there actually was that time when a ton of people got in there-there was a festival. I was six then. We celebrated for three days and it went fine..."
536951, "Who constructed it?"
536952, "That I do not know. It was already there when I was born."
536953, "How old are you? "
536954, "Eleven. Almost twelve. "
536955, "I see."
536956, "All right... let us hope the Tower manages."
536957, "I wonder why I hasn't been informed about this."
536958, "Me too! I wonder why you haven't?"
536959, "That attitude will get you into trouble."
536960, "So they say."
536961, "What do you have there? "
536962, "I've saved up so many nuts... But who's going to play them now? "
536963, "Will you finally tell me how you play nuts? "
536964, "Oh! It's a whole separate life. Each nut has a name, an age and, most importantly, experience. But not just any experience! We believe that the more adventures a nut experiences-while staying alive, of course-the more precious it becomes."
536965, "Adventures? "
536966, "Ha ha! Together with the owner, of course! A nut must drown in water, burn in fire, lie under a train, rob the Dogheads, get wet in a cellar, pay a visit to the Abattoir-and so on... But these games pale in comparison with what you can play in the Tower, of course... "
536967, "Why? "
536968, "Everything's different there. There's real magic. Visions... Continuous dreams. Even love. I've fallen in love there, can you imagine? It's an enchanted place."
536969, "My condolences."
536970, "Aren't you a bit too young for that?"
536971, "You'll find someone."
536972, "There were seven of us in the gang. There are just three of us now. I wonder if it ever ends..."
536973, "Do you miss your friends? "
536974, "No... Not really. That's weird even. I know I'm supposed to be sad, but I just feel numb inside. Like frozen."
536975, "Yes, it happens. You will start to grieve after a while."
536976, "It'll end very soon. "
536977, "Everything ends one day."
536978, "Do you like the Polyhedron? "
536979, "If I ever get to the Tower, I'd love to play Reflections. "
536980, "What is Reflections? "
536981, "Well, there's a labyrinth. Nobody knows what its structure is like because it feels like it's a mile long. You keep walking and walking and walking and it never ends. And when you're out, it's not actually you, but rather your reflection-and you yourself go to the Otherplace."
536982, "How can a labyrinth of that size fit in there? "
536983, "That's the trick! Perhaps you're not walking at all-perhaps you're going around in circles or standing pat-and the reflections make the space around you feel like it's shifting. Isn't that cool? That's the magic of reflection. Those who come out act very... mysteriously."
536984, "Mysteriously how?"
536985, "Unlike themselves. It's like it's you, but not really 'you' you... They're not very talkative. That's why they say it's a reflection-its only purpose is to be there so that your parents aren't worried and all that. And the real person goes to the Utopia country. A miraculous land."
536986, "Did many children go into the labyrinth? "
536987, "They say many used to go in before, but then they realized what it does and got scared a bit. All in all, it's not so popular these days. But Smartypants did go in. So did Crowfoot, by the way... Most of them are with Notkin now."
536988, "A curious story. "
536989, "I'd go in there too."
536990, "You make me jealous."
536991, "Meh. You're spewing nonsense."
536992, "You'll get there. "
536993, "Well? What are you looking at? "
536994, "Hey, Bachelor! Did you know that Burakh was looking for you? "
536995, "What does he want from me? "
536996, "I'm not sure. But he wants to spill rivers of blood. He was going to come to an agreement with you because he won't make it without your help... Hahaha! "
536997, "Why would he spill rivers of blood? "
536998, "That's how he can fulfill his purpose and become the Shepherd of Beasts. But that's just what they say. I don't know why. Perhaps he just feels like it? Are you planning to spill rivers of blood too? You're planning to raze one of the districts, aren't you?"
536999, "It's a lesser-evil solution."
537000, "Just don't you dare touch the Polyhedron! "
537001, "We'll see how it goes."
537002, "Do not worry, young man. Whatever happens, the Tower will not come to harm. "
537003, "I'm an artificer, not a butcher. "
537004, "No, he'll have to make do without me."
537005, "Let him keep looking. "
537006, "Tell me about the Hindquarters. "
537007, "Hey ho! The Hindquarters is a merry district! It's in Earth, above the factories, on the bank of the Gullet. That's where the ominous Willows are, a house of ill repute, and a pub called Factus Est. The Twins tend to spend their time at the latter-so staying there is dangerous for both your life and sanity!"
537008, "What's The Willows? "
537009, "A malicious wench lives there! Name's Anna Angel. A proud potato if I've ever seen one. She used to be a famous singer and now she's dealing in spells and hexes! We'd smash her windows with stones, if not for the respect we used to have for the previous owners..."
537010, "Who lived there before? "
537011, "A girl named Willow Mellow used to live there. And then she died! That's how it goes. No one would have thought about it twice, had she not died right after offering shelter to poor Anna Angel! Grace says that Willow was buried in a closed coffin... And that coffin was suspiciously light... Spooky, isn't it? "
537012, "Are you kidding me? "
537013, "Ha ha! Yeah, I so pranked you! Now excuse me, I'm in an awful hurry... We'll talk another time. "
537014, "Hey! "
537015, "The lack of proper education options is a grave social issue indeed... "
537016, "You're a quick lad. Now off you go... "
537017, "Tell me about the Polyhedron. "
537018, "That's where the youngest Kain-Kaspar, styled Khan-has fortified! There are more than a thousand children up there now; almost every child in the town went to the Polyhedron-except for urchins, orphans, and bold daredevils like me! "
537019, "Are you trying to tell me they live there? "
537020, "Well... The older ones do. The younger kids just come by to play. But yesterday everyone who's older than three and younger than fifteen had a huge gathering there. They're hiding!"
537021, "From the parents? "
537022, "From fate, Bachelor... From fate. Yeah!"
537023, "You cannot hide from fate. "
537024, "Good for them."
537025, "Tell me about the Crude Sprawl. "
537026, "Bah! The most rottenest place ever! The soil breathes there as though it could swallow you whole. A real bog! What could you possible need in that place?"
537027, "How do I get there? "
537028, "It's simple! When they tell you to go to hell, just choose any direction; when you've found the worst place in the world, this is it! Ha ha ha!"
537029, "You are a very impolite young man. Try to answer me once again, but this time be serious."
537030, "Oh... There's something very alarming in your eyes... I apologize profusely! It's in Earth. The southernmost eastern district that borders the Abattoir. Its other end is adjoined to the Cemetery! Rawrrr!"
537031, "Thanks. "
537032, "Do be more polite from now on."
537033, "How about a smack on the head?"
537034, "Nothing. I'm just curious."
537035, "Tell about the Tanners district."
537036, "A menacing place! It's the northwest cape of Earth, the backside of the town. That's where The Rod, the Saburovs' mansion, is. We don't play there. Alexander is not to be trifled with. You never know when his strict gaze turns towards you..."
537037, "What's so bad about it?"
537038, "Well, who knows... No, don't ever mess with the Saburovs. Then again, the wife-Katerina-is not only a witch, but also a Mistress. I was too young to see any of the old Mistresses. Katerina was the last one... Although I've never seen her either."
537039, "Stop-stop with the chattering! Slower, please! What are the Mistresses? "
537040, "Rumour has it they're like goddesses. A Mistress is the Mother of All. They knew how to control time, focus power, create an Outburst, and tell the future. Among other things. Like I said, Mothers of All."
537041, "I see. "
537042, "Shush, why you are shaking? I'm not making you go there."
537043, "Thanks. "
537044, "Tell me about the Skinners district. "
537045, "What is there to tell? It's just a district... in Earth. The nothernmost of the western districts, it's further to the north than the Termitary. Ah! Actually, a good friend of mine, Sticky, lives there! Sticky the Nuthatch! Do you know what a nuthatch is? It's a very sly snake!"
537046, "And where does Sticky live? "
537047, "Well... In a house on the bank of the river Gorkhon. It's actually tricky to find... When you're there, just ask someone, they'll show you."
537048, "I will."
537049, "Actually a nuthatch is a bird. All right, thanks for the help. "
537050, "Like I would want to rub shoulders with the likes of you... "
537051, ""
537052, "I'm sick, I'm in agony... My head seems to be filled with lead... my insides burn. Could you please donate a couple coins for me to cure myself and my family? I'll repay you... I'll spread the word of your untold magnanimity..."
537053, "Take it. I hope you use it wisely."
537054, "How much is there? "
537055, "A hundred is enough for you."
537056, "Five hundred. "
537057, "One thousand. "
537058, "Two thousand. "
537059, "Three thousand. "
537060, "Four thousand. Remember, it's intended for all of you!"
537061, "What do you care? I can also give nothing. "
537062, "Are you unwell?"
537063, "I think I have a fever... My brain is on fire and my heart's also kinda... But it will pass... It will..."
537064, "Do go straight home. Your condition demands you lie down."
537065, "What can you tell me about the local cemetery?"
537066, "The Cemetery? Why do you ask?"
537067, "The call of duty."
537068, "Then it may be of interest to you that the local burial culture is extremely primitive... The late caretaker of the Cemetery was a local too. He encouraged the backwards practices of illiterate herdsmen. The dead are still being buried carelessly!"
537069, "Carelessly? What do you mean by that?"
537070, "The bodies aren't always interred. The locals believe the Earth to be their foremother. Only a select few get buried into the ground; the rest have to do without. Some are buried deeper while others lie much closer to the surface."
537071, "What do they do to the bodies that are not interred?"
537072, "The Kin doesn't show anyone what they do to their dead. I never belonged to the Kin anyway. The Termitary is perforated with holes-they drag the body inside, and in a day they pull out a leather parcel and pay their respects to the dead."
537073, "Don't the local authorities care at all?"
537074, "The Kin governs itself. Big Vlad doesn't bother them as long as they keep generating profit. They're on their own... so what? They break no laws-so they're allowed to do whatever they want at home. They are a constitution unto themselves. They follow their ancestors' rites."
537075, "This is utterly barbaric."
537076, "Ew... disgusting! "
537077, "Do all townspeople do that?"
537078, "No, of course not. The civilized people bury their dead properly. But prejudice and superstition are very much alive-and the higher-ups encourage them! What is there to say if such people are in charge of the Cemetery? God knows what they do at night when no one's looking."
537079, "I've ended up in a real hellhole, it seems..."
537080, "What was the caretaker of the cemetery like? "
537081, "I've never talked to him... His daughter is in charge of the job now. She also adheres to the old traditions completely, following her father's teachings. She feeds the dead..."
537082, "Feeds them? With what?"
537083, "Bread and broth. She also pours fresh milk into the graves."
537084, "Ah, okay, obviously..."
537085, "You look like you may very well relocate there soon."
537086, "Very funny... Yes, very much so... Is this an outsider's joke or a doctor's diagnosis?"
537087, "A joke. "
537088, "A diagnosis. "
537089, "What do you need money for, old man? "
537090, "One has to stockpile necessities! I think I'll spend the rest of the day shopping. The prices seem to be rising for some reason... That means people are worried. Or are those the profiteers' shenanigans? Huh? What do you think?"
537091, "What does it have to do with profiteers?"
537092, "Think for yourself. There are little to no eatables and other essential goods left in the town. Everyone's waiting for the regular train to arrive."
537093, "The town based on slaughterhouses has no eatables? Are you joking?"
537094, "We cannot eat the meat of our bulls! We're not supposed to... They'd disapprove of us. They're very straightforward, you know. Like children."
537095, "When famine starts, you'll sing a different song."
537096, "I don't think there's going to be a famine... still, our reserves are gradually getting depleted. There are lines at every food store. A loaf of rye bread costs fifty! Seems like the ruler's death and the rumours of a maneater have disturbed everyone greatly."
537097, "Everything happens."
537098, "Yes, it's an ordinary panic."
537099, "Who is 'like children'? Bulls? Is that your parenting policy, huh...?"
537100, "What is the general food situation in the town? "
537101, "Oh, don't even ask... We've been waiting for a train for three weeks now. We're used to it coming like clockwork every month; the shops aren't used to stocking on perishables. And household reserves are at an end... All anyone can talk about these days is famine."
537102, "Really? I doubt there is a famine threat. Doesn't the town have a decent supply of edibles storaged somewhere?"
537103, "I do not think about it at all."
537104, "What about your family? What are you sick with? "
537105, "All diseases come from poverty and malnourishment... Oh, what will become of us? "
537106, "Why are you asking me?"
537107, "But they say there is an outbreak..."
537108, "So there is. And?"
537109, "Anyone can die... Any second anyone can get infected by anything... No one is safe... I'd rather it was shabnak-adyr the maneater raging!"
537110, "Everything is relative. "
537111, "Will everyone who gets infected die? "
537112, "Everyone who asks moronic questions will, that's for sure."
537113, "No. Not everyone. Miracles happen. "
537114, "Look! Leave me be! I don't even know what kind of disease it is yet!"
537115, "Even if every second person dies, each of you has a chance to end up being the first."
537116, "You think that's my fault?"
537117, "No, no, the thought never crossed my mind... But you must be able to think of something... To save us from the blight!"
537118, "I have no plans to."
537119, "But isn't that the reason why you've been sent here?"
537120, "I have not been sent here, old man! I came on my own volition. As a private person. "
537121, "You can say so. Retrospectively... those bastards."
537122, "I'll try. "
537123, "Easy, easy there... Nothing will. You will all die. "
537124, "You should have a rest. You're exhausted. The air here is detrimental to your health."
537125, "Yes, that's just how this place is... Every breath threatens death... It's like walking through crossfire... or a simple fire. But what can you do? We have to..."
537126, "You 'have to'? Would you be so kind as to explain to me what emergency is forcing you outside?"
537127, "We're looking for food... We're hungry! We need to check on our relatives... to see how they're doing! Secondly, staying in is even more terrifying. It feels safer outside. What if that thing engulfs the house like it did five years ago? It tended to just appear inside the room back then... by itself."
537128, "I said, stop scurrying! Away with the unnecessary fuss!"
537129, "Nonsense. Things do not appear 'by themselves'. "
537130, "That's why you are continuously being told to stay in! Wait for the Executors to come to you!"
537131, "Really? "
537132, "Not only do you increase the risk of getting infected, but you're also spreading the disease! I should have you all shot."
537133, "But for some reason it only makes pinpoint attacks... Some houses perish from the pest, while others remain unscathed. They seem to be in the clear; in my opinion, that means they're free to walk through."
537134, "No one cares for your opinion. Mine is the only one that matters in this regard."
537135, "It's your own fault if you get infected then. And the patrolmen will keep you carriers from entering other districts."
537136, "Really. Volunteers come to every house to bring medicine and take orders. "
537137, "Lies... No one comes anywhere."
537138, "Wait a bit, they will. "
537139, "You're spelling your own doom."
537140, "Fever? Anything else?"
537141, "Oh, it's suffocating... Do you by any chance have any medicine?"
537142, "You're suffocating? What about your bloodflow? Do your vessels hurt?"
537143, "No. But my soul does... Why is Mother Earth so angry with us? Who's been tormenting her? What did we do wrong, professor? Did we gather too much twyre? No, the Kin's been doing it since ancient times... and it was fine."
537144, "What does earth have to do with it?"
537145, "It's simple. The locals respect the Earth, even though we are no farmers, but rather herdsmen... They also say the sun evaporates these miasmas into the air, so the air is bad around here. So who knows where the pest comes from...?"
537146, "It's not your job to think about it."
537147, "Yes, you're right. It's all the sun's fault."
537148, "Wasn't medicine distributed to you?"
537149, "We have been given some, but they say this medicine doesn't work in small dosages-and big dosages lead to poisoning and even death."
537150, "Who says that?"
537151, "People do... They say one has to swallow up twenty neomycinum pills to stop the infection. They're being tested today-various pills, that is-and volunteers are encouraged... They say if the testing is successful, they'll start handing the stuff out."
537152, "Perhaps... And who did you say was in charge of this?"
537153, "They say the Olgimskys have snatched control of it. They'll be the ones to profit from our torment now."
537154, "Yes, that they will."
537155, "Mind your tongue."
537156, "Hang in there."
537157, "That's fine. You're all going to make it."
537158, "It's too crowded here. People burden the earth. It's time to cull the population... The Earth requires way less people than what we have. Otherwise there'll be calamity after calamity."
537159, "Oh really?"
537160, "Yes! Earth is depressed under the burden of humankind. Its crust is way more delicate than it seems; it gives in under our weight. And then murderous spirits pop out from the underworld."
537161, "Are you sure murderous spirits live underground?"
537162, "Well, that was me allegorizing... But the people of old claimed that the underworld is, well, underground. That's because they were afraid of what hides there. Worms. Heat. Caves. The dead... Even if the murderous spirits do not live there, it's still a bad place..."
537163, "Well, that's probably true."
537164, "There are precious minerals and resources down below too."
537165, "This line of thinking would make sense for a child or an uneducated Steppe savage."
537166, "Eh... Within each of us there is a place where either a scared child or a wild barbarian hides. Whenever pressure gets too high, they start bawling... He he..."
537167, "I don't know about you, but there's no one bawling inside of me."
537168, "That is because the pressure you're under is manageable..."
537169, "That is not for you to judge."
537170, "Yes, the demographic crisis is poignantly evident in this desert. The population density here is one person per five square kilometers!"
537171, "Yes, but they're gathered together, the people are all gathered in one place, and they're standing on the most sore spot of the earth, pressing upon a swollen ulcer... This town is quite unwell, wouldn't you agree? A nervous hernia, if you will... That's just how it feels. And that's the blister everyone is pushing and pushing and pushing..."
537172, "Directional pressure, right?"
537173, "You think the earth feels pain because of this?"
537174, "Nonsense."
537175, "Why do you all keep whining and complaining! I'm just about to start howling along..."
537176, "It's over. There's no point in struggling anymore."
537177, "This line of thinking will lead you to your death. Expressing it aloud will lead you to being arrested."
537178, "But there are no other feasible lines of thinking... It's obvious, isn't it? Only a blind person would claim this plague to be anything but the punishing hand of fate. It has no natural causes. The human mind is unable to comprehend its spreading process."
537179, "We'll see about that. "
537180, "I don't think it's doable. Everything I see around me has an undertone of absurdity. This illness cannot be defeated-and therefore it cannot be explained. To explain is to defeat. You-you want to get to the bottom of this. Little do you know that this is impossible... "
537181, "My intentions are none of your business. "
537182, "Whatever you say, whatever you say..."
537183, "Keep your advice to yourself."
537184, "And get to the bottom of this I will."
537185, "Do not measure the limits of the human mind with your yardstick."
537186, "No one is expecting that from you. "
537187, "Do you also have your own ideas about the origins of the epidemic?"
537188, "The Tower oppresses the Town. The Town smothers the Steppe. The Steppe gnaws at the Tower. That's the three different... heh... pieces. Too different to be put together, like three minds fighting over a single head. If I am not mistaken, this condition is considered to be... pathologic?"
537189, "You're describing schizophrenia. "
537190, "Right, exactly. Insanity, absurdity, hallucinations. The whole world is feeling feverish. And the war cannot come to an end, too; the frontline is about to crumble, and then the enemy armies will rush to our southern lands... "
537191, "No way. Anything but this. "
537192, "Perhaps you're right. "
537193, "So you're a part-time prophet now too, old man? "
537194, "No... My brain is boiling like soup in a pan... So I'm getting ideas. It's just that... you can't have it all at once... This greed would cost you life. And you, doctor, should leave... There's nothing to be done here anyway."
537195, "Leave? How in the world could I do that? "
537196, "Soon, soon the long-awaited train will arrive. Everything will be here-the doctors, the medicine, the food. "
537197, "Here's to hoping."
537198, "I'll leave when I deem appropriate. "
537199, "Tell me, does any building in the town seem suspicious to you? "
537200, "Why do you ask? "
537201, "The carrier or the source of the infection could be there."
537202, "Oooh! I thought so-surely someone must be be picking the plague up by the handful somewhere. They throw it around then, and here you go-an outbreak. And then it dies out. Then the next day someone throws more bad stuff around... Sounds plausible... But who can it be? Perhaps the Executors with their masks and their cloaks?"
537203, "I was asking about a place. "
537204, "Perhaps it's the infected food from the Warehouses. Or maybe rats? What if something died beneath the ground? Rats gnaw on carrion, tear it to slices-and then they slip into the houses... And there you have it. You should talk to Saburov about that. He's supposed to be in charge of the cellars."
537205, "No, I doubt it's that simple."
537206, "Thank you."
537207, "Everything happens."
537208, "I continue getting to know the local sights. "
537209, "We were lucky twice. This commander is even better than this inquisitor. What do you think? "
537210, "Are you kindly joking? I've heard that this Alexander Block is rushing to get to the front."
537211, "So what? "
537212, "So what! He's in a hurry! No wonder he's... you know. Feats of arms are waiting for him there-and here he has to deal with rats and purulent rags... It won't take him long, mark my words. Cordon off, bring the weapon in, aim, fire-and that's that."
537213, "By the way, where are his quarters?"
537214, "In the Town Hall. Therefrom he will command, until the bombardment starts."
537215, "It won't."
537216, "I see."
537217, "I hope he is a decent human being."
537218, "We have to hope these terrifying weapons are being brought to the front, not here-and for your sake."
537219, "The soldiers aren't bullying you, are they?"
537220, "I was almost shot. "
537221, "By whom?"
537222, "The gatehouse post soldiers. Do they have the right to shoot anyone suspicious? "
537223, "Who cares about rights now... The one whose rifle shoots further has the right. "
537224, "No. Only the infected. "
537225, "Rightly so."
537226, "You unfortunates are simply out of luck."
537227, "I think this is a righteous plague. "
537228, "Why? "
537229, "It's a tool of history. We should listen to the voice of time. "
537230, "Why is your time displeased with you then?"
537231, "Civilization is about progress. Anything that has no practical use shall be eradicated. Rational thinking conquers all. If you stand in the way of the progress, it will crush you. "
537232, "I don't have time for idle chatter."
537233, "Yes, many would agree with you."
537234, "Nonsense."
537235, "I am the last person you should bother with these ideas of yours! Be thankful I have spared your life!"
537236, "So do I."
537237, "Go in peace. "
537238, "Acually, my funds are also running low. Soon I will beg in the streets too. "
537239, ""
537240, "We know all about you..."
537241, "Aren't you a lively gal! Shall we barter, perhaps?"
537242, "What are you so happy about, girl?"
537243, "We've almost caught the Unseen Cat! Wanna come see her?"
537244, "Where did you find such a cat?"
537245, "It's the famous pale cat! Her eyes are like translucent emeralds, her fur's grey, and her body is completely transparent!"
537246, "I would never go after such a fright."
537247, "The light passes right through her! It's very pretty. But most importantly, she's invisible in the dark. And rodents can't hear her-that's how light her step is. She belongs to the Pale Obtuse."
537248, "To the What Obtuse?"
537249, "Ah, it's no use-I know you won't believe me anyways. Just come over and see the cat for yourself when it gets dark, it's by the 12th warehouse. The password is 'Hell froze over'."
537250, "I'll do my best not to forget this intricate phrase."
537251, "Not today."
537252, "Well, that changes things. Drastically."
537253, "So what, can you see its bowels too?"
537254, "Tell me about the Tower."
537255, "What do you want to know?"
537256, "How does it not fall?"
537257, "It stands on a firm and very very very solid stem. But it keeps oscillating, too. It was scary at first, but we got used to it."
537258, "It contravenes the laws of physics."
537259, "Well done!"
537260, "What's inside of it?"
537261, "Us. We play there. Khan won't let you in, I take it?"
537262, "I don't know who Khan is. Haven't had the pleasure yet."
537263, "It's just idle interest anyway."
537264, "Tell me about the Works."
537265, "What is there to tell? Umm... Well, that's where Dad works... and Grandpa used to, too."
537266, "Where are they?"
537267, "What's produced there?"
537268, "Well... sausages and canned meat, I suppose. Some kind of flour... I mean, I don't know. Meat food. We eat none of this, it's all for the train. Not that I would ever eat anything they make anyway."
537269, "Why is that?"
537270, "Do you know what it smells like in there? Just try it! Eew... I hate that stink."
537271, "My stomach doesn't agree with foul odours either."
537272, "You're too sensitive, young lady."
537273, "I see."
537275, "No. I'm allergic to cats."
537276, "Definitely."
537277, "What's up?"
537278, "The Soul-and-a-Halves got an opportunity to catch their breath. This is good, now everyone will have the time to prepare. Otherwise we'd have to mourn our boys... and the Halves would be orphaned."
537279, "The Soul-and-a-Halves?"
537280, "It's just a catchy name. Notkin says it's because each of them has a familiar-a cat, a dog, a crow, or a grass-snake. Half-a-soul more than a normal person. Or a normal animal..."
537281, "Is that a game?"
537282, "It's a lifestyle that's larger than life! If you join the Soul-and-a-Halves, you have to adopt a pet. As you raise it, you change. Then, when it's grown, it gets the other way round, your Half begins to take care of you. And so you are always together, bound forever."
537283, "And what if the animal dies?"
537284, "I don't know... No Half has ever died before. What kind of a Soul-and-a-Half are you if your familiar can die? They wouldn't take you in in the first place."
537285, "Naturally."
537286, "Animal lifespan isn't that long."
537287, "I see."
537288, "Hmm... I thought the locals believed that a normal person is supposed to have one soul. Isn't soul-splitting only reserved to your Steppe abominations by the local folklore?"
537289, "Are you nuts? The shabnak don't have a soul at all! Although... Perhaps Notkin has finally done it. He used to make fun of the old legends, taunted the Steppe, played spirits. So perhaps the shabnak came to show him his place!"
537290, "What do they do, those Soul-and-a-Halves of yours?"
537291, "Stop saying nonsense."
537292, "What halves, what in the world are you talking about?"
537293, "Tell me about the Termitary."
537294, "Dad won't let me go there. No one's parents let them. We're not even allowed to come close."
537295, "Why? Is it dangerous?"
537296, "It's the people there. They aren't bad, but they can do you a lot of harm. They believe, for example, that it's okay to eat other people. Or, if a person is buried alive, it's seen as a gift for them, a great honor. And generally... the Termitary people can do something... abominable to you."
537297, "Can't anybody do anything about them?"
537298, "Well, it's not like they actively hurt anyone. They just have their own way... they're all kin to one another. But who knows... It'd be dumb to get on their nerves. It's like going into a beast's cage. Who can tell what's on their mind?"
537299, "Makes sense."
537300, "Children of your age are supposed to be supervised by adults if they go anywhere past their neighbourhood."
537301, "Still, how do I get in there?"
537302, "Go to the east end of the Skinners, you'll see it."
537303, "Much obliged."
537304, "Tell me about the Abattoir."
537305, "Ooooh. It's creepy! Not only are you not supposed to go there, you shouldn't even mention it without need."
537306, "Why such extensive precautions?"
537307, "Brother says it's inhabited by gods so old that beasts used to believe in them before humans even came to exist."
537308, "What? Bollocks."
537309, "No bollocks. It's all for real. When you come close to them, you do feel that someone impossibly, inconceivably large lives inside. People say the Abattoir so big because it covers the cavities of the unburied udurgh."
537310, "What udurgh?"
537311, "An udurgh is, like, a really really huge living creature. Like an animal god, but made from soil. He produces sticky yellow tar instead of saliva, and it's with this tar that the sky is attached to the ground."
537312, "Lovely."
537313, "Unburied?"
537314, "Yeah, he was only buried partially-the bottom's still above the ground. Some people say that the mouth is also sticking out, but others maintain it's his huge belly. And he breathes sometimes, so he hasn't kicked the bucket yet."
537315, "...What am I even doing here talking to you?"
537316, "I'll take a look if I ever get the chance."
537317, "Then you really aren't supposed to go there."
537318, "And how do I get there?"
537319, "Come on, you can't miss it. Missing this mostrosity would be an achievement in and of itself! Here's how you go-to the east, then turn once, turn the second time, then go south. It's right there, past the Crude Sprawl and the Skinners."
537320, "Thank you."
537321, "And the Crude Sprawl and the Skinners are...?"
537322, "There they are, in Earth! Gee, you're completely clueless, aren't you? Let's see. Here you are, facing the river, right? The Guzzle's to the left, the Gullet's to the right. The area between them is called the Knots. The Stone Yard is to the right from the Guzzle. Earth is to the right of the Gullet. Got it now?"
537323, "I got it, darling."
537324, "No... I didn't."
537325, "Ah, you're impossible...!"
537326, "Well..."
537328, "Don't worry, you'll get another chance to mourn the boys yet."
537329, "Easy there! Where are you running so fast?"
537330, "Shopping! Everything's getting so pricy... The prices are rising by leaps and bounds! Literally by the hour, and I mean it! An hour ago butter cost a hundred, and now it's five hundred! I can't even imagine what it'll be like by the evening. What am I supposed to tell Mom?"
537331, "Why is this happening?"
537332, "People say it's because the train will not come, and because there's something stirring..."
537333, "What train?"
537334, "The train train! The one that transports food into the town. We have nothing stored at home, not even flour. You know how much I love stickjaw? And candy boxes, you know, the ones with green, yellow, and orange sweets all mixed up. But I've gobbled up the last one I had a week ago..."
537335, "That is indeed a sobering tragedy."
537336, "So did you buy a lot?"
537337, "Nothing at all... we don't have that kind of money. Do you know how much they ask for a loaf of bread in the Spleen? Three thousand! You could buy a horse for that! I thought for a bit that I was going bonkers... "
537338, "So this is what sheer panic looks like..."
537339, "What? "
537340, "Never mind."
537341, "Are you afraid your mother's going to scold you?"
537342, "Mom sent us all out shopping. Told us to look all over the Town and buy everything we can. Obviously, first and foremost it's sugar, salt, flour, bread, fish... Oh, oops! No fish, no, and no meat. What else? I forgot...!"
537343, "I would also recommend buying vitamins and antibiotics. Do you have a drugstore around here?"
537344, "There's one in the Atrium, two more by the Theatre... you'll find them. There is a drugstore or even two in any segment of the Town. And what are antibiotics?"
537345, "Ask the druggist-and then go ahead and buy all sorts of them."
537346, "Why?"
537347, "They'll come in handy later."
537348, "Thank you."
537349, "Do your best to remember then."
537351, "Hurry up then-while there still are any goods to buy at all."
537352, "You're so pale..."
537353, "I'm dying for a gulp of milk... But they won't let us milk the cows. Do you by any chance have some?"
537354, "Who doesn't let you milk cows?"
537355, "Well, people say that cows have been oozing some ichor instead of milk lately. Auntie said she knows this for sure, and Mom nodded and added that Ayga, the cook, agrees-and she's a Steppewoman and all... she knows everything about cows. Ayga even went as far as to say that milk turned completely black."
537356, "She's right; doesn't sound like you should drink such milk. I'll check on your cows or assign this task to someone."
537357, "This story alone would be enough to make me never drink milk ever again."
537358, "I'm not a nursing mother, am I now?"
537359, "Did you want to ask me something?"
537360, "Yes. Have you tested our shmowders?"
537361, "Shm-what?"
537362, "I remember us playing shmowders. We used to invent various recipes, taking various amounts of various medicines and mixing them. It was like a competition-whose recipe would turn out to be the most efficient? And, well... some of them were."
537363, "How is it possible?"
537364, "Now I realize that it was all accidental. But the thing is, everyone who participated in the game made more than one shmowder following their recipe. That means there have to be several more efficient shmowders in the town-we only need to figure out whose solution was the useful one."
537365, "Hmm... And how would I find this child prodigy if I ever went looking for them?"
537366, "We don't know that either... Crowfoot's completely lost any skill, Beaker's brothers have died. And no one knows who else was talented with shmowders! There was this one guy... but I doubt he remembers anything at all. We were very little back then, you know. We were simply stealing the prettiest pills-no one really bothered to read labels."
537367, "What a shame!"
537368, "You dummies..."
537369, "Any chance I could get my hands on them?"
537370, "Our boys shuffled through several old caches. Hopefully I haven't slipped my beau's mind... and he'll bring me one. Just in case."
537371, "And where does one find these old caches?"
537372, "At the Dovecot or the Mild Dew... Why do you ask? It's not like there's anything left there-except maybe several 'dead' shmowders. The ones that kill instantly."
537373, "Show me anyway. What's deadly to a five-year-old can become the salvation of an adult."
537374, "Fine, whatever."
537375, "Let us hope there won't be a case."
537376, "I have."
537377, "And? Have you figured out what they're made of?"
537378, "Outdated drugs that are no longer produced."
537379, "I haven't."
537380, "What's with the disgusted expression?"
537381, "Yuck! The river water stinks! I wonder why..."
537382, "What do you mean, 'stinks'? Stinks with what?"
537383, "Who do you think I am, a professional stinker? I don't know! But the stench is awful, and tons of dead fish get washed ashore. Their bellies are all soft, white, and bloated... Yuck... I wonder if the water's been poisoned?"
537384, "Could be, could be..."
537385, "I didn't see anything of the kind."
537386, "Do elaborate. Are you saying it's abnormal?"
537387, "Of course! We've got a very clean river here, the girls and I even drank directly from it. But recently water's become filled with fish scales-and the pollution is so thick, as if someone's mixed in this... substance there on purpose. You know, you just put your arm into the water, and when it's out, it looks like a mermaid tail, all scaled. And now it stinks too!"
537388, "Well, what do you know..."
537389, "It's just silt."
537390, "Do you by any chance know where I could get some water around here?"
537391, "Almost all barrels have been emptied, but you may luck into leftover water in some of them. You can bottle it up and sell it! I wonder how much a single sip of water will cost in two days..."
537392, "No less than a million, I guess."
537393, "A million? Nah, I don't think it'll go that far. But five thousand sounds plausible."
537394, "Just boil riverwater."
537395, "There is some running water by the Cathedral and the Theatre, but the flow dies out often. That's because water has to accumulate first."
537396, "Yes, that's also an option."
537397, "Yeah. It's like we're in a desert."
537398, "I'm just... perpetually thirsty. My mouth is sore as though I was always chewing dust."
537399, "Same here."
537400, "Have you been crying?"
537401, "Our family is ruined..."
537402, "What happened?"
537403, "Do not eat meat! It was banned for a reason! I think meat is precisely where the disease is nesting. It must have all started with someone stuffing themselves full of infected meat. That's why everyone was blaming a maneater, too! It all makes sense now."
537404, "What made you think that?"
537405, "Dad and other men attacked the guards yesterday and pried a meat storage open. The meat was then distributed among our neighbourhood. Then almost all of them fell sick... And I'm so afraid Mom and I will fall sick and die too..."
537406, "How long ago did you eat the meat?"
537407, "I don't really remember... Five hours or so, I think..."
537408, "That's a shame. What about your father? Is he alive?"
537409, "He was taken into custody."
537410, "Go home then."
537411, "I don't have a home now. It's infected!"
537412, "Then go to the Cathedral."
537413, "I'm sorry."
537414, "It's gonna be all right."
537415, "Then it will be okay. If you were sick, you'd have noticed it already."
537416, "Fair's fair. That's what burglars get-especially at a time like this."
537417, "The disease is nesting everywhere."
537418, "I have something for you. Barter?"
537419, "Bachelor, dear Bachelor! What is it that you have?"
537420, "A lot of things. What would you offer for this...?"
537421, "A burning desire to make you all very happy if you stop poking me at every given opportunity."
537422, "You are not alone."
537423, "Are you smelling of... fish?"
537424, "No way! You're not supposed to eat fish! Or catch it, or touch it! Neither can you eat bread. Or go outside. You're not supposed to do anything at all, and that includes breathing. So how are we supposed to live?"
537425, "Cleanse every object you get in contact with, use antiseptics. Boil everything that can be boiled."
537426, "Sure... Should we boil air or anneal it?"
537427, "Just stay in and stop roaming the streets!"
537428, "And also... I'm just starving for lemons and sugar!"
537429, "I hear you."
537430, "..."
537431, "Annealing works best."
537432, "Try silver water."
537433, "Tell me a story."
537434, "Are you for real? All right then. Here's the tale of the Gorkhon river and its tributaties, the Gullet and the Guzzle. Long time ago there lived an old man by the name of Bai Uraggha. He had the head of a bull, the body of a man, and the cow's hooves for hands."
537435, "What about his legs?"
537436, "His legs stretched all across the earth, sinking into it like gigantic roots. He ate rocks, grass, and the trees that were to be found in his vicinity at first. But it didn't take him long to eat everything that his head could reach, and so the ground around him turned to desert."
537437, "Then what happened?"
537438, "All in all, he was gluttonous and helpless. After eating everything he could reach, old Bai Uraggha felt thirsty. Guess what happened next?"
537439, "I can't possibly imagine."
537440, "Think some more then. I'll tell you the ending if you tell me what happened after he felt thirsty."
537441, "Fine."
537442, "He must have died."
537443, "Correct!"
537444, "What does it have to do with the river?"
537445, "That's part two of the tale. I'll tell you later."
537446, "Looking forward to it."
537447, "Poor old man."
537448, "I don't have to tell you this, you know."
537449, "Sorry for interrupting you. Please, go on."
537450, "In all honesty, I don't really have the time for this either."
537451, "What is it, my fair lady?"
537452, "Do you have any nuts?"
537453, "Why are you looking for nuts?"
537454, "First of all, you can play with them. And now you can eat them, too."
537455, "Didn't you eat nuts before?"
537456, "Well... Would we eat you? Of course we wouldn't-and you're obviously nuts too. Eating nuts! It's like eating your kitten or your stamps collection. Every nut is a story! A chronicle of adventures. They even have names. But... recently we've begun to eat them. We have to choose each time which of them goes..."
537457, "It does indeed sound very sad."
537458, "Where I come from, nuts are ground into flour by the hundreds-to be added into honey or a sauce."
537459, "That's not funny."
537460, "Stop teasing the soldiers. They don't have a sense of humour."
537461, "Have you seen general Block already?"
537462, "I have."
537463, "What's he like? Does he really have long metal teeth?"
537464, "He's just a person, same as you."
537465, "Great! That means he can be killed! Do you think I could ask for an audience with him and secretly bring a dagger with me? Will I make a good killer?"
537466, "And how would you lull him into a false sense of security?"
537467, "I'll try to seduce him. And if he remains passionless, I'll pretend to be a petitioner. I'll kneel before him, crawl to him as if I was trying to grab his hand-and then I'll pierce him with the dagger, right through the heart!"
537468, "What an ingenious and elaborate plan."
537469, "You wouldn't reach his heart."
537470, "Don't even think about it."
537471, "He has regular teeth... alothough they are kind of long-ish."
537472, "I haven't."
537473, "What's the news?"
537474, "The boys are mourning their dogs."
537475, "What happened?"
537476, "Yesterday, the soldiers shot almost all the dogs of the Soul-and-a-Halves. The only survivors were Pong, Mittens, and Lobe. So several boys sharpened their bolts, took their crossbows, and went to the soldiers to get revenge. They haven't come back yet."
537477, "Why didn't you stop them?"
537478, "We'd go with them if we could! But they didn't let us."
537479, "None of them will come back."
537480, "Good for you then."
537481, "Nice job. I would have done the same."
537482, "You can find better targets for mourning than dogs around here."
537483, "Was there something you wanted to tell me?"
537484, "A girl named Clara was looking for you. She said she wanted to propose a path to salvation to you. By the way, do you know that she collects people's souls and demands they sign the contracts with blood?"
537485, "No, I didn't know that. Why is she doing this?"
537486, "Oh... It's all very complicated-and it makes me very uncomfortable. Everyone's afraid of a maneater for a reason, you know. I think she strikes a deal with them so that they would allow her to use their bodies posthumously somehow... to save everyone."
537487, "Is that so... and do people agree?"
537488, "She has about a dozen signatures, I think. But she needs thirty or forty, something like that. She says that she'll be able to arrange a happy ending for everyone then."
537489, "Oh my... I'll do my best to intervene before she succeeds."
537490, "See? She's a nice, kind girl."
537491, "In all the time that I've been struggling with your lot, I haven't heard of a single act of cannibalism. So cut it, will you?"
537492, "I'm not interested in Clara or her proposals."
537493, "Why are you so upset?"
537494, "Mom said it's time we all went to the dumster. What do you think?"
537495, "I agree."
537496, "But it's not like you'll be able to escape this fate either. You'll be taken to pieces and turned into stuffing and rags... heh."
537497, "'Heh' indeed."
537498, "Don't get in my way."
537499, "I think your mother is way too strict."
537500, "Nah, she's just rational. She has seen things. If she says dumpster, dumpster it is. I've always been dowdy, I'm pretty plain. And kind of a bonehead, too."
537501, "Well, dumpster it is then."
537502, "Don't say that. You are a charming little lady."
537503, "No, I don't think so."
537504, "I know all about you too."
537505, ""
537506, "Wow... that's startling! What's wrong with you?"
537507, "Let's trade. Just look at this thing I've got..."
537508, "Well, you know. I'm leaving the town soon. Do you know the train schedule?"
537509, "Hey, but will you revive Grandpa? When the game starts again, I'll ask him to make me a hunter!"
537510, "Who are you going to hunt?"
537511, "If Grandpa shows you how to hunt right, you can even catch a star. But you can only keep it for a while. Only while the game is on."
537512, "And what are you playing?"
537513, "It's autumn, so we're playing Underground Bonfire. Do you know the rules?"
537514, "I used to play it when I was a kid."
537515, "You couldn't have played it when you were a kid! Grandpa only invented it a month ago!"
537516, "All right, you got me."
537517, "Who knows..."
537518, "No, I don't."
537519, "That's an inherent quality of stars."
537520, "I'm not so sure, little fellow."
537521, "Don't lose your heart! Miracles happen, right?"
537522, "Of course they do."
537523, "Today has proven that there are no miracles."
537524, "So you're playing, huh?"
537525, "Whoever finds another one first gets to eat them! These are the rules."
537526, "What are you talking about?"
537527, "That's how the hide-and-seek works. You are the hunter, you are the hunted. Whoever finds the opponent first kills them."
537528, "Does that include me?"
537529, "Of course it does! Beware."
537530, "Don't worry, kid. I'll finish the killer, whoever they are. I am the hunter."
537531, "I'll find the hunter, wherever they hide."
537532, "Thank you for the lesson."
537533, "You really shouldn't be running around like that..."
537534, "Do you know me?"
537535, "Yes. You are the Bachelor. You know about the Changeling and the Ripper, right? They're at your heels! And they use every opportunity you miss to their advantage."
537536, "What do you mean?"
537537, "And they spoil your plans all the time! They talk behind your back and tell lies about you!"
537538, "How?"
537539, "Clara says you love the truth so much that you won't tolerate any lie at all and will raze to the ground anything that resembles it. Burakh says that you only care for your mind, not your heart, and that you are unkind."
537540, "I wonder how they know all this."
537541, "Because they are your doubles."
537542, "I doubt that."
537543, "They aren't telling lies. This is all true, kiddo."
537544, "And he's kind, huh."
537545, "Uh huh. And Clara is also very nice, she cares about everyone and keeps them safe. People say she's a saint."
537546, "What a hypocrite she is..."
537547, "Then let us hope that I'm the most evil of us three."
537548, "Those bastards!"
537549, "What's with the open mouth, kid? You're drawing flies."
537550, "Is it true that they can raise people from the dead in the Capital?"
537551, "Who told you such nonsense?"
537552, "My dad! He read about you in the papers."
537553, "I just wanted to make it so that people would live longer, really. And, preferably, on their own accord."
537554, "Sounds cool! So they wouldn't be able to die on someone else's accord then, right?"
537555, "That would be too cool to be true."
537556, "People will forever keep dying on someone else's accord."
537557, "Rubbish."
537558, "Yes, it is."
537559, "What?"
537560, "Wanna know what will happen to the Ripper?"
537561, "And what will happen?"
537562, "He will heal the god. And then the grief for the loss will break him. That's because a very pretty lady will fall in love with him shortly, and right now he's crafting the tool for her execution."
537563, "Wait, wait, wait. Why? What execution?"
537564, "He has no choice! He wants to help everyone. He is actually not a Ripper, he's a Haruspex. He is a lot like you, honest and kind. Maybe he's your brother?"
537565, "I'm not kind."
537566, "Please spare me a brother like this."
537567, "How do you know all this?"
537568, "Because we gossip about you all the time."
537569, "Ah, I see..."
537570, "That is not something I would ever want to know."
537571, "What's up, kiddo?"
537572, "Do you like Clara? The Changeling?"
537573, "I'm not sure."
537574, "She is the person who can definitely raise people from the dead! We personally saw Clara drive the disease out of a person. He regained consciousness and went back to his family."
537575, "How did she do it?"
537576, "She put pressure on his eyes and temples-here and here-with her hands. It went on for a while. Then she held his head in her embrace and kissed his nails. Then dirt came spilling down from below his eyelids, and black worms crawled out of his sleeves. And then he started breathing a little, then a little more-and came back to life."
537577, "That is impossible."
537578, "From what I've heard of her, not in the slightest."
537579, "Why not?"
537580, "I think she's a fraud."
537581, "She always sticks her nose into other people's affairs. And she'll get her just dessert if she keeps doing it!"
537582, "Hey hey hey! Don't you say bad things about her! We won't be able to play without Clara."
537583, "Play?"
537584, "Yeah, we play with her."
537585, "Then tell her not to get in my way!"
537586, "I see..."
537587, "I won't-if she behaves."
537588, "Do you have anything useful to trade?"
537589, "The Bachelor is up for trading cool thingamajigs! Yay! Do you really wanna trade? For real?"
537590, "I do."
537591, "Not this time, kid."
537592, "I am yet to determine that."
537593, "Why are you looking at me askance?"
537594, "Mom says you're cold and calculating."
537595, "How does your mother know that?"
537596, "Because everyone is talking about you, because you're a celebrity, and because everything we're hoping for depends on you. We're all so, so scared of you. And Dad says that you are a breath away from death and they're gonna force you to make the wrong choice."
537597, "Who is going to do that?"
537598, "I don't know. I'm a little boy. I'm just repeating what I've heard from the grown-ups."
537599, "Hmm... You're really too sharp for a little boy."
537600, "Think for yourself and stop misquoting people."
537601, "You common folk are definitely biting more than you can chew here. Reserve your judgement for the matters you know a thing or two about."
537602, "Mom is completely right."
537603, "Who do you want to be when you grow up?"
537604, "When I grow up and become an adult like you, I'm going to be a puppeteer. Like Mark Immortell. I'll do magic tricks, pull puppets by the strings and tell fortune from someone else's bones!"
537605, "A daring dream. So you want to manipulate others?"
537606, "It's either that or the other way round..."
537607, "You couldn't have come up with this on your own."
537608, "Yeah, that's what Dad says."
537609, "Perhaps your dad said that in a bad mood."
537610, "Your father is very smart. Great parenting."
537611, "No, it's doesn't necessarily work like that. You can be simply yourself and remain free."
537612, "When I was very young, I wanted to be a military man. It was just about the time the war ended. My parents thought I'd become a celebrated counqueror."
537613, "Then I think you'd like to know that troops are arriving here soon! The troops of Alexander Block, the conqueror!"
537614, "What did you say? How do you know this?"
537615, "The Polyhedron showed us a prophecy! A train of iron will arrive, filled with armed soldiers. They're bringing giant cannons with them to raze the town to the ground and exterminate all life here!"
537616, "...But why?"
537617, "What do you mean? So that we don't spread the disease, of course!"
537618, "Makes sense... But hopefully we won't have to deal with anything of the kind."
537619, "Don't worry, kiddo. We will exterminate the disease before they point their guns at us."
537620, "I know that already."
537621, "Did you want to ask me something?"
537622, "Have you made friends with Mark Immortell?"
537623, "No. I don't trust him. He's sleazy, like a weasel or a snake. He likes to be economical with the truth-and that is something that I abhor."
537624, "Oh yes! You love the truth and want to know it, right?"
537625, "I guess so..."
537626, "No need to guess, it's obvious. And Mark-he knows the truth and is afraid to distort it. That's why he uses masks, puppets, and riddles."
537627, "Perhaps."
537628, "Once again you are demonstrating the level of intelligence that I find rather disconcerting."
537629, "Sorry! Won't happen again."
537630, "Yes, please be so kind as to avoid doing this in the future."
537631, "Bear in mind that there's only one smart person here: me."
537632, "He's a curious fellow."
537633, "What's that noise?"
537634, "The maneater escaped through a locked door again!"
537635, "Yeah, right."
537636, "She did! And they said it's safe inside! How can it be safe if she creeps through the cracks?"
537637, "Stop saying nonsense."
537638, "Listen to the adults. They'll explain it to you."
537639, "Let us hope she is gone for good then."
537640, "Are you all right?"
537641, "I'm scared by the Masks. I know it for sure that there are no people beneath them!"
537642, "Who is beneath them then?"
537643, "Sometimes I think it's the sharp claws and white nails of someone's gigantic fingers..."
537644, "Wow! Your imagination is staggering."
537645, "You think so? That's a rather ingenious remark. Especially considering the role they play in your dying society..."
537646, "Sometimes I think so as well."
537647, "I really hope I'll have a chance to depart this place as soon as humanly possible... I'm sick of it."
537648, "Maria said she likes you so very much that she'd be willing to renounce the throne for you."
537649, "...And follow me into exile?"
537650, "I don't know. I'll remember to ask her if the topic ever comes up again. And it probably will, since you are all she really talks about. Are they going to exile you?"
537651, "Don't even think about it. It was just a quip."
537652, "Keep her safe, will you? She's a bit odd, but really nice. I'd be glad if she ruled over us. Then our life would be beautiful, engaging, and-most importantly-adventureous! She can transport us all into a wonderland."
537653, "Of couse I will. She'll be safe."
537654, "I can't say I care for her all that much."
537655, "But she does care for you...! What a shame. Oh well, your call..."
537656, "My call indeed."
537657, "Most likely. It doesn't seem that I'm likely to return triumphant from here."
537658, "Ahem. Well, one certainly couldn't tell that by her attitude."
537659, "Hey kid, where is the Hindquarters?"
537660, "It's on the Gullet's bank. It's where The Willows and the pub are located, and the Works are by the Hindquarters' side."
537661, "What is the Gullet?"
537662, "The river that cuts the town transversely. The one closer to the Abattoir."
537663, "I see."
537664, "Thank you."
537665, "Could you point me the way to the Crude Sprawl?"
537666, "Ooh... it's on the outskirts of the town, by the cemetery and the Abattoir. If you keep going past it-kinda diagonally, you know?-you'll get to the Rotten Field."
537667, "And... what's the Rotten Field?"
537668, "It's where they bury the bulls' bones. The place is covered with fur instead of grass, and it's all bones bones bones underground. Bones and horns. Yeah."
537669, "I see."
537670, "Thanks."
537671, "Tell me about the Theatre."
537672, "Oh, it's our piece de resistance! The place for the most significant things to happen! The shows they do... puppet plays about a shade, an orphan that came out victorious, a little thief girl, and a scientist who made the world end! Lots of stuff!"
537673, "So it's a puppet show, huh."
537674, "Not only that! They also have the Masks perform every evening, but I'm not allowed to those shows."
537675, "Why?"
537676, "I'm too little a boy."
537677, "I see."
537678, "And where is it?"
537679, "On Spin-a-Yarn Square, duh!"
537680, "And where is that?"
537681, "It's in the Marrow district. That's in the middle of the Knots, closer to the Guzzle."
537682, "What is the Guzzle?"
537683, "It's when you're very very hungry and eat or drink something very very quickly. Look, here."
537684, "Yeah, I know what guzzling is."
537685, "It's a transversal river. The one closer to the Polyhedron."
537686, "Now I see."
537687, "Thank you for clearing this up for me. I was at a loss before this enlightening lesson."
537688, "All right, see you later then."
537689, "Tell me about the Tower."
537690, "You don't need that."
537691, "Why not?"
537692, "Because we won't let you in anyway. There's a secret room inside."
537693, "And what's in there?"
537694, "Like I said, a secret."
537695, "Well, suit youself."
537696, "Who is 'us'?"
537697, "The little ones."
537698, "Do you play there?"
537699, "Oh yes! We very much do! We also live there. And go on journeys sometimes."
537700, "Hmm, I see."
537701, "Okay then, no pressure."
537702, "What's that Cathedral in the central square?"
537703, "It's not the central square at all, it's Bridge Square. And the central square is the Spin-a-Yarn one."
537704, "Why is it called Bridge Square?"
537705, "Because at first no one knew there was going to be the Tower, so the plan was to create a square that would be completely situated on a very large bridge, like that wide! They would make a fun-fair there."
537706, "Well, I guess the Tower is quite more compelling."
537707, "Of course it is. I mean, there could have been magicians at the fun-fair... But the Tower is way more exciting than any magic tricks."
537708, "Why is that?"
537709, "Well... Because."
537710, "You have masterfully evaded the question."
537711, "And still-what about the Cathedral?"
537712, "I don't know... Never been there. My sister attends it sometimes. And always comes back with a handful of love letters!"
537713, "That's olain hypocrisy!"
537714, "How old is she?"
537715, "I think... twenty? I think."
537716, "Then it makes sense."
537717, "A pity the plan fell through!"
537718, "No it's not! The Polyhedron is obviously better! What would they sell at the fun-fair? The things that the train delivers? You can get them in any store already. It's boring... no toys, no stickjaws, no fireworks..."
537719, "They'd think of something."
537720, "Yeah, I love fireworks too."
537721, "Great question, kiddo!"
537722, ""
537723, "I've heard so much about you, ooooh!"
537724, "What's in your pockets, pumpkin?"
537725, "Presents. Uncle Bachelor, do you want to trade presents?"
537726, "Why not? Sure."
537727, "You can't just trade presents away."
537728, "Let's barter, pumpkin! I can see that you have a lot of interesting things..."
537729, "Why so gloomy, pumpkin?"
537730, "I want Grandpa to get better! It's sad without him..."
537731, "Is your grandpa sick?"
537732, "My grandpa is dead. Grandpa Simon is sick. No one plays with me now... The grown-ups never let us into their games. Neither do the boys."
537733, "He really loved you little ones, didn't he?"
537734, "'Loved'? Why do you put it like that? He still loves us. And he always will. Even the naughty ones."
537735, "Sure, of course... Just a slip of the tongue."
537736, "Grandpa Simon is also dead, pumpkin."
537737, "Grandpa will get better. Now go play."
537738, "Don't be sad, pumpkin."
537740, "What's up?"
537741, "Are you really playing hide-and-seek with a maneater?"
537742, "Yes. And when I catch him, I'll eat him!"
537743, "Be careful though! Everyone is very frightened. He's a good runner and he has strong teeth. A good eater too. A gobbler even."
537744, "Sure, I'll be careful."
537745, "Don't be frightened."
537746, "Who in the world is filling your little heads with all this...? There goes my hope that at least the kids would be exempt from baloney-spewing..."
537747, "What maneater?"
537748, "The one that ate Grandpa Simon."
537749, "Don't be silly."
537750, "Why else would everyone say that there's not a single piece left of him?"
537751, "No one says that to me."
537752, "Go play in the sandbox."
537753, "Don't worry. Grandpa Simon is fine. Hopefully I'll soon get a chance to confirm that first-hand..."
537754, "You shouldn't be running around unsupervised!"
537755, "What's the news?"
537756, "This Clara, the make-believe saint-girl, is actually a dirty liar!"
537757, "Oh really? Did she lie to you?"
537758, "Not to me, no. But now I know very well that she's not who she pretends to be!"
537759, "Who is she then?"
537760, "When she lays her little hands on someone, people die. Everybody said she had a healing touch. But it's the other way round...! Better avoid her embrace. Her hands are far from tender..."
537761, "Did you actually witness anyone die?"
537762, "My brother told me. He did. She walked right behind an armed mugger as he squatted trying to ambush someone. Brother was keeping an eye on him. Clara put her palms on his eyes. He gave a jolt and then went quiet and fell down stone cold very soon. And Clara just laughed and walked away."
537763, "Quite a story..."
537764, "Attagirl! You'd be better off avoiding the likes of her though."
537765, "It's not like I'm interested in her tenderness."
537766, "What, has she been beatified already?"
537767, "Beauty-what? As in made pretty?"
537768, "I'm saying you people were quick to proclaim her a saint."
537769, "She's no saint! She is actually the baddest killer there is! There goes the promise to 'save us all'..."
537770, "Why do you call her a killer?"
537771, "And who said that Clara would save everyone?"
537772, "They said two harbingers were to arrive, one of them celestial and fair, bound to save everyone, her hands warm. The other is her dark doppelganger, a shabnak-adyr-a clay maneater made of the bones of the wrong dead people. She'll crawl from beneath the ground, and plague will devour this land. There you go."
537773, "And what do you personally make of this? (...I wonder who fills their little heads with this drivel?)"
537774, "At first it was believed to be about the Mistresses, Maria and Capella. But I'm so fond of Maria! She shines from the inside and she's all magical! I'll never in a million years believe that she's shabnak-adyr the maneater. So it has to be a spirit thing. And that means Clara is one of them..."
537775, "Is she? Which one? The good or the bad?"
537776, "Sounds unconvincing. The Mistress interpretation is actually more plausible."
537777, "Whoa... And which dead people are wrong?"
537778, "The ones that were only half-buried. They were naughty in life, and the Earth couldn't digest them. So their bones make evil spirits. You'd better ask Grace, she explains it very well."
537779, "And what does Clara have to do with all this?"
537780, "I see. I'll ask Grace for clarification."
537781, "Nevermind. Just thinking out loud."
537782, "Hi there, pumpkin."
537783, "I've heard a lot about you too."
537784, "You look cheerful, that's a good sight."
537785, ""
537786, "Do not condemn us for our lasciviousness. That's just how the local customs and morals are..."
537787, "Do give me a shoulder massage, girl. I'm tired. My muscles ache."
537788, "Let me kiss you, will you? It will invigorate me."
537789, "I have something for you. "
537790, "If this is a token on your affection, then I shall offer you the last thing I have in exchange."
537791, "Deal. Let's barter."
537792, "I've heard the word 'maneater' repeated more than once today. What was it all about?"
537793, "Soft flesh, warm blood... So sweet! I can constantly feel it with my whole body. There is a maneater in any of us girls. Wouldn't you agree, darling? "
537794, "I agree, but I also find anthropophagism terrifying."
537795, "Well, you don't really think she dragged Simon to the kitchen and is boiling him there on a slow fire, do you? Of course not. It's all very metaphoric. If he's overwhelmed by her, if he's into her, if she had her way with him... then she's a maneater."
537796, "Who, Simon? I thought he was two hundred years old at least."
537797, "Flesh is eloquent! It says a lot about its owner. Simon's body was made from very tough flesh and very hot blood. A body to be jealous of... like yours. It would be a shame is shabnak tracked you down."
537798, "Why don't we talk about something lovely instead? Like you, for example."
537799, "You know there's only one thing on my mind..."
537800, "I can see that."
537801, "You've had a bit too much."
537802, "Enough, please. "
537803, "Metaphoric?"
537804, "Are you being so predatory on purpose? These little games of yours can end badly, you know."
537805, "Tell me about your customs. "
537806, "The body is sacred. The naked body is the most accurate image of the world. People used to tend to their bodies as if each of them were a shrine. Cripples and freaks used to be banished from the community not so long ago-just before the Saburovs came to power. Such was the bidding of the Kin. They were devoured by the Steppe. Earth corrected its mistakes."
537807, "Why do you strip your sacred body naked then?"
537808, "Because I know the Dance and have the right to do so. But in the Termitary they wrap themselves in so many clothes and cloths that it becomes impossible to make out human features beneath all that. They cover their bodies to set up some protection againts evil spirits. And it's not like they worry about themselves..."
537809, "Who are they worried about then, my sweet dervish?"
537810, "They know that the body doesn't belong to them. Who would be hurt if a bull were to bite a finger off them? The whole bottomless cosmos would. Everything is akin to everything and everything is interconnected with everything. You know about that, don't you?"
537811, "It contradicts natural sciences, but... generally it can be accepted that your theory has the right to exist."
537812, "Oh, you killjoy... So many words! Why don't you just smile instead?"
537813, "There, is that better?"
537814, "Of course I do, my pretty. You stop being smart over there and just dance, okay?"
537815, "Is your dance special in some way?"
537816, "Yes. It is a tribute to our world's beauty."
537817, "Oh, that I'm perfectly willing to accept."
537818, "What happened to them next?"
537819, "That's the scary part! The locals believed that if the Steppe doesn't accept a freak back into her womb, they'll creep out again as an evil spirit-a nastail, a mara, or a shabnak-adyr. That's how it goes. And that's why no one really cared for freaks around here."
537820, "Some cruel utopia was being built here."
537821, "Not even close, as they say... But butchers can feel it very acutely. They have to. It's the law of survival. A guarantee that the world wouldn't turn against them one day... Like it does now."
537822, "So, the whole issue is that somebody had had their little finger cut off... And here I am, running around and trying to find the reason behind all this."
537823, "Don't make fun of me. It's only a legend, but there is an ancient truth to it."
537824, "Anything is possible."
537825, "Come on, these are just silly fairytales..."
537826, "Do you like me? "
537827, "They say you're the smart hero."
537828, "That is correct. I'm an intellectual. That means I'm very smart."
537829, "How are you smart? Smart people are four-eyed nerds... bulgy heads on stunted legs. Cunning, cautious, weak, old even... no, you are not a smart man. You are a warrior."
537830, "So intelligence is a sign of weakness to you?"
537831, "That's just common knowledge. Women of the Steppe do not love smart men. We love violent men, furious men, we love destroyers. Were you not one of those, would I have fallen in love with you?"
537832, "You are correct. I am a destroyer. "
537833, "How so? "
537834, "I destroy lies with my mind."
537835, "Oh... So that's why there are always sparks of hatred in your eyes. And that's why your smile is so spiteful."
537836, "That's because I'm destroying the disease now. And I will succeed-no matter the cost."
537837, "But not for you, sweet angel. "
537838, "I destroy death. "
537839, "I destroy superstition."
537840, "You can be both."
537841, "Really? I thought you can only have one. Your eyes are throwing needles, and your teeth are clenched fast. You've got the face of a man who can sweep down anything that stands in his way. The face of a destroyer."
537842, "Correct. This is the true purpose of smart people."
537843, "You know so much about me! I wonder how?"
537844, "It's a den... Everyone loosens their tongues here. Some due to alcohol, some due to swevery, and some due to delight. You can't remember who says what, but everyone is talking about you. They say you don't look like a smart man."
537845, "Why? "
537846, "Tell me my fortune, sweet girl."
537847, "How am I supposed to tell your fortune? You don't have a heart."
537848, "Wrong. I do."
537849, "But it's cold, isn't it? "
537850, "What makes you say that?"
537851, "You are absolutely heartless. Seems like pity is alien to you. Even your obsession can't really be called a feeling."
537852, "My weapon is cold reason. It has no need of emotions. "
537853, "You are correct. Pity is not the feeling I foster."
537854, "Is it so obvious?"
537855, "You are very beautiful. "
537856, "Do you really never tell lies?"
537857, "I hate lies. "
537858, "Why? Lies are often inescapable. And they make your heart feel warm and nice, too... "
537859, "It is through lies that the weak and the dishonest set their dark plans into motion."
537860, "What makes you think they have to be dark?"
537861, "Because they replace the true state of affairs with a false one to profit from someone else's suffering."
537862, "It's in their nature. "
537863, "I don't have a heart, remember?"
537864, "Nothing is more villanous than deceit. "
537865, "Why? I didn't say 'deceit'. Telling a lie doesn't equal deceit."
537866, "All my life those who pretended that black was white prohibited me from winning. Every deceit hides someone's dark intentions."
537867, "Why don't you tell me who the carrier is?"
537868, "Look, there are so many of them around... A thousand and a half, no less! Every third of us is boiling alive. Every single one is ready to drag his fellow man with him. So which one do you need?"
537869, "No, you don't understand. I need the person that spreads the infection but doesn't get sick in the process."
537870, "Like the Typhoid Maid? "
537871, "Yes. Precisely."
537872, "How horrible... Perhaps she doesn't even know herself how dangerous she is. Can you imagine? She must feel nothing..."
537873, "Wait a moment! Why are you saying it's a 'she' rather than a 'he'?"
537874, "I don't know... It just slipped out. Maybe it's because we were talking about the Maid. And everyone's looking for a female maneater, you know. It must be the same wretch... All in all, it just slipped out."
537875, "All right... "
537876, "I feel that you know more than you're letting show."
537877, "What Typhoid Maid?"
537878, "People say all kinds of things around here, you know... So they say that in a faraway land beyond the sea, in the West, there was a horrible pestilence a hundred years ago. Only in their case it was typhoid. And then it turned out it was all because of a maid. She worked for modest households, went from one kitchen to another to make soup. She was sick with typhoid, but in such a fashion that she didn't die."
537879, "Yes, exactly. Perhaps someone like her is walking this place too."
537880, "Yes, you are right... and each one fits the bill."
537881, "What's the word in the den?"
537882, "Turns out the Inquisitor is late Mistress Nina' sister. A younger one. I wonder if they are alike..."
537883, "This cannot be! "
537884, "Can you imagine? I stood their gaping too. Some of those who were loyal to Nina came to pay their respects to the sister of the late Mistress. They came to pay respects-but ended up paying a terrible price for that! We were too rash to assume that such an inquisitor wouldn't execute people."
537885, "But why? For being loyal to Nina?"
537886, "They hate one another. Or rather the inquisitor hates the Mistress. I think Nina probably disregarded her at all. Not a single person who knew Nina-take Andrey, for example-remembered her ever talking of having a sister..."
537887, "How do you know that? "
537888, "Ah, I don't know... Rumour has it. Andrey has a face like thunder, see? Although I can't say he was surprised by the news. Perhaps he did know beforehand?"
537889, "Perhaps."
537890, "Curious..."
537891, "What does that entail?"
537892, "Everyone who loved Nina is probably going to face bad times... We were too rash to assume such an inquisitor wouldn't execute people."
537893, "Why? "
537894, "Don't worry, it can't be worse than what you have right now."
537895, "You dancers are so serene-as always. Are you really not afraid at all? "
537896, "The darkest hour is always just before dawn. It feels so great to clean out all the dirt and start life anew!"
537897, "Yes, good thinking..."
537898, "I'm so afraid of the debauched soldiers though. They're definitely going to frequent the pub."
537899, "Start a rumour that it's not a pub, but rather a plague house. "
537900, "They won't be stopped by that."
537901, "Well, their commander is keeping them in check for now."
537902, "They won't be staying here for long."
537903, "That's how it always is."
537904, "I wish... "
537905, "How do you think it's all going to end?"
537906, "Simon will live eternal as long as the Polyhedron stands; that means all the prophecies have already come true. "
537907, "Could you please remind me what prophecies you're talking about?"
537908, "That Simon is meant to live forever. They said he had died-but he hadn't! The Kains will transfer his soul to the Polyhedron, and it will flicker there eternally, shining its light upon us."
537909, "And how are they going to do that?"
537910, "I don't know... Why are you asking me about it? I have no skill to talk about it. That's what Yulia-or better yet, Maria-is for."
537911, "Then I'm off to their places."
537912, "Forget it. "
537913, "Do you believe in the immortality of the soul?"
537914, "How can I not? The soul is immortal, but it gradually departs the world of the living and goes away into space, faraway and cold. If you let it go, it will be lost in the void forever."
537915, "And what about transmigration of souls?"
537916, "Nonsense. "
537917, "Get drunk and think about nothing. "
537918, "What's with this... odd smile?"
537919, "I want you to be happy. Touch me tenderly... Take my hand above the wrist or my waist. Lower... "
537920, "What's gotten into you?"
537921, "We shall all disappear soon-only you will remain. I want you to be happy."
537922, "Why would you all disappear?"
537923, "We cannot live. I feel that when those up above us will be deciding our fate, it will turn out that we are not to live in this world. We will have to be no more. Am I right?"
537924, "You quite probably are. "
537925, "We'll see."
537926, "Thank you."
537927, "Nothing can be further from my mind."
537928, "I don't have the time to anyway."
537929, ""
537930, "If you see a mugger, barber, looter, firestarter-any violent person, really-you go ahead and whistle or call for the guards. Just enunciate the word, will you? G-U-A-R-D-S. Otherwise we may confuse it for the shrieks of the infected. They're wailing constantly, y'see; out loud, and collectively, too."
537931, "Are there a lot of infected people here? I'd rather avoid them..."
537932, "So you're patrolling the streets? Be so kind and protect those who can't stand up for themselves."
537933, "Enunciate, hmph... Are you aware that whistling is actually a skill-and not everyone has it?"
537934, ""
537935, "The infected areas are strictly off-limits. Keep out."
537936, "I want to barter."
537937, "See this thing? I've taken it off a thug. Keeping an eye on them is your job, by the way. I will barter one for one."
537938, "I've been granted emergency powers. You must have been informed by the governor. I'm Bachelor Dankovsky."
537939, "Yessir, we were, sir. I apologize; better safe than sorry. Come through. But keep in mind, sir, they're all crazed, mad, and insane in there. Possessed. If they attack you, go ahead and run anywhere, but do not kill them! We'll have to intervene and beat you within an inch of your life. For they are innocent and in pain."
537940, "So they are going to attack me, but not you? How in the world does that work?"
537941, "Well, you is doc. We patrolpeople have nothing to offer them but a good old blow on the head, and we won't let them out. They tried to escape, there's no denying that. They did. We taught them a lesson though. And we're protected, too, thanks to you."
537942, "Protected?"
537943, "Yessir... They've distributed them pills among us, told us 'twas on your orders. Told us they're very much a good remedy to invigorate the body, but bad for the heart. Also they make it so that your blood doesn't curdle no more, but rather fills them veins, making them bursty and thus shabby... Am I saying it right?"
537944, "You seem to be describing cardiovascular diseases-in which case you are correct, yes."
537945, "You should stop trying to be smart, mate. Just stand guard."
537946, "I had nothing to do with it."
537947, "But infected people are a danger to society."
537948, "Yessir! Which is why they have been blocked off on the governor's orders. What business would you have with them? We keep your life peaceful and free of them-and theirs is free of your exasperation as well. You're welcome to come and take the risk if you so desire, but please keep your emotions to yourself."
537949, "I'll try to."
537950, "Just do your job, will you?"
537951, "...What are you saying, Kindred One? Don't you see who stands before you? I know the lines. I am Isidor's son... "
537952, "Oh, it's you... Yeah, I see you right and clear. Well... I for one have always respected your father. As for you, I've never believed it was you that... well, your father... oh, forget it. Rest in peace and all that. Come through. Just you watch it-are you really as quick on the draw as they say?"
537953, "No way. All lies. I'm calm and gentle."
537954, "Okay, okay, go... Your goal is the potion, isn't? The golden twyrine tear? Can it really be made?"
537955, "Everything happens. What about you? Do you drink infusions or brews?"
537956, "I do... Our guys used to take them from Stakh, Isidor's apprentice. Way better than them pellets. We distribute those among the population-they love pellets, especially the ladies. But a brew's a solid thing. That's why we're standing here all engulfed in the pest-and we couldn't care less... Come on now, go. I've no time for idle chatter."
537957, "Thank you, Kindred One."
537958, "Keep drinking them then. And drink mine, too, they work."
537959, "It can. All in due time. I'll make it if you stop bothering me."
537960, "I am what I am."
537961, "Hush... Watch it! No killing the infected! Go ahead and exterminate them marauders, killers, and thugs-I'll be more than grateful. But don't you lay a finger on them infected! I'll attack you straight away then, and it matters not that it was your old man that had cut my sore out from me. For 'tis my duty. You gotta know how it works."
537962, "I do. Don't worry."
537963, "Deal. But don't complain if I fight back."
537964, "Be silent, human. Here is my home. Don't you dare stand in my way. "
537965, "You idiot! I know!"
537966, "Don't you know who I am? The disease will not take me. I have no fear."
537967, "Calm down. I'm a surgeon. You got my drift?"
537968, ""
537969, "Anything I can do for you?"
537970, "I'd be much obliged if you helped me learn how to get around your town."
537971, "There's more than one town here. The first one is called the Bull Project. The second one-the offspring of the Project-is the Districts, I mean the residential part itself. Not so long ago the town also dropped anchor across the river, but I wouldn't go so far as to call that part a district too. It's just... the Polyhedron."
537972, "Tell me about the Bull Project."
537973, "It's the industrial base of the town. The Station, the Warehouses, the Works, and the Abattoir all belong to it. I wouldn't recommend going there... It's not an appropriate place for a person from the Capital. It's filthy there, and the stench... I'd say it's not an appropriate place for anyone at all."
537974, "Didn't think about going there anyway. Say, how come such a tiny town is divided into districts?"
537975, "I've hated beef for as long as I can remember."
537976, "'The Districts'? A peculiar way to call the... well, the town itself."
537977, "Well, it just sort of came to be that way... The Gullet and the Guzzle-the Gorkhon's tributaries-divide the town into three parts; each of them consists of many separate courtyards, so maybe that's the reason."
537978, "And what are those parts?"
537979, "The lower part, adjacent to the Abattoir, is called Earth. The one between the Gullet and the Guzzle we call the Knots. And the triangular promontory between the Guzzle and the Gorkhon is the Stone Yard."
537980, "That's... intricate. What about the districts' names?"
537981, "The Stone Yard consists of two districts: the Bridge Square and the Atrium-plus the Mistresses' Tombs, of course. Earth has four residential districts: the Skinners, the Tanners, the Hindquarters, and Crude Sprawl. In the middle..."
537982, "Is something wrong?"
537983, "I'm just not sure you need any of this... The Knots have seven districts: the Spleen, the Marrow, the Chine, the Backbone, the Mouth, the Flank, and the Gut. I don't suppose I need to go into further details; surely the Kains will show you around. They are expecting you after all."
537984, "Much obliged."
537985, "...Starting this conversation was a mistake."
537986, "That'll do for now."
537987, "I see. Well, here's to hoping none of it comes up today."
537988, "And what's inside of that... Polyhedron?"
537989, "Nothing really... Children like to play there, I guess. And they say it's perfectly empty, bare as the palm of your hand. What could there be inside such a monstrosity? I find it unbelievable that it's still standing at all. I'd never let my children enter the damn thing. Ever."
537990, "I see. What about the Bull Project?"
537991, "So you've never actually been there yourself?"
537992, "The kids don't like it when we grown-ups try to visit them in the Polyhedron... Not like there's anything special in there. Why would anyone even want to climb that thing?"
537993, "All right. By the way, why do you call your town 'the Districts'?"
537994, "Thank you."
537995, "Tell me about the Town Hall."
537996, "The Town Hall is the most useless place in the whole town, I'm telling you. The only thing it's good at is taking up space. It's the most prominent building in the Backbone. Sinister... and still useless."
537997, "Why useless?"
537998, "Because we are ruled by the-well-Rulers. There are no officials around here, and no need for them, too. You want to know what's up there, in the Town Hall? The post office and the jail, nothing more. It's fine; they'll finally repurpose the building someday. Turn it into a school maybe? Whatever the facility, it would still be of better use."
537999, "I see. How do I get to the Backbone?"
538000, "How come you still haven't got a map? You're lost for good without one! The Backbone is in the Knots. That's the middle part of the Districts, between the Gullet and the Guzzle."
538001, "Much obliged."
538002, "A school instead of a jail? Great idea."
538003, "What is the Termitary?"
538004, "Two massive buildings in the eastern part of Earth. The Termitary marks the Districts' border. Beyond that there is only the Abattoir and then the Steppe itself. People do not belong there."
538005, "Why?"
538006, "Well... They just don't. It's not a people place."
538007, "But someone has to work there, right?"
538008, "Some... folk do. The Steppe people, the butchers. That's way outside of your area of expertise, believe me."
538009, "That was intriguing, my good man."
538010, "I have a feeling you're not much of a talker."
538011, "I see."
538012, "The Warehouses is a district as well, right?"
538013, "It is. But there's not much to tell about it... It consists of two parts. The first part is where everything that the town exports is stored: meat, sausage, ham, bone meal, and so on. The other one stores various hardware, and also the manufactured goods that the regular train delivers."
538014, "And how do I get there?"
538015, "That's in the Knots-its southeasternmost part, to be precise. To the east of the Station. The meat warehouses are the ones closer to the Station, the hardware ones are closer to the town. There's a railroad track running between them."
538016, "Thank you."
538017, "Tell me about Nina."
538018, "When Nina died, everyone was terrified. No one could wrap their mind around it; it was truly and utterly unthinkable-and yet it happened. Dying is not really a common habit around here, you see. And so when Nina passed away, everyone started saying that a shabnak came for her soul, or maybe a turnskin... a creature from beyond."
538019, "I see. But what can you tell me about Nina herself? Her name doesn't really ring that many bells to me."
538020, "Nina Kaina! Nina the sorceress... The most gorgeous woman I've ever seen. So wild and fierce and intimidating! Just one brief look at her walking down the street-with or without her escort-could make you weak in the knees. You could almost picture her upon a throne. She could cut you with a knife looking you in the eye-and no one would say a thing. Only a shabnak could take that one."
538021, "So what, did anyone find the turnskin?"
538022, "Not really."
538023, "So now you want to give it another try?"
538024, "Very funny..."
538025, "I'm not in the mood for laughing. At all."
538026, "Now that's a twist."
538027, "What is a 'shabnak'?"
538028, "A make-believe monster from the Steppe... A bloodsucker of some sort... just, you know, a revenant from beyond. Or maybe a possessing demon... I don't really believe in such things. On the other hand, sometimes the things you see... Live here long enough and you'll get used to all kinds of weirdness. The Steppe is wiser than we are."
538029, "Uh huh. Definitely wiser."
538030, "Where is the Station?"
538031, "Didn't you get here by train?"
538032, "I got here by chance. How do I find the Station?"
538033, "The Station is not a part of the Districts... It's a part of the Bull Project. It is located in the southernmost part of the town. Attached to it, so to speak. And still, how did you get here? If our regular train was here... "
538034, "What is a regular train?"
538035, "A goods train which delivers edibles and other things... As you can see, we have nothing around here. The train usually comes on the 25th of every month... but now it's already two weeks past due! The last one was here in July."
538036, "I see."
538037, "I got here on a switch engine."
538038, "I asked you first."
538039, "Tell me about the Abattoir."
538040, "Just your regular abattoir."
538041, "Clear as daylight."
538042, "Death is never a habit-not even someone else's. You can't really get used to it."
538043, "What is the history of this place?"
538044, "The town was built step by step."
538045, "Please do tell more. Yesterday I had a geography lesson, today let's have a background review."
538046, "The town grew bigger as the owners of the Bull Project grew richer. Eventually the Town of Beasts surrendered and became the Town of Men."
538047, "Go on..."
538048, "The Town of Beasts nurtured the Town of Men-and demanded nothing in return. That's how the Districts came to be. The inhabitants of the Town of Men didn't really concern themselves with bulls. All they did was build, trade, and craft... Even the smell is somehow not omnipresent."
538049, "Fascinating."
538050, "The town is thriving. Life couldn't be better."
538051, "Sounds like a real utopia. It's mind-boggling to think that this is all possible in a small community built upon a gigantic factory."
538052, "That's because our rulers prefer investing into the local environment. "
538053, "And why is that?"
538054, "I think they kind of feel like the rulers of the world-and it makes sense, after a fashion. Our self-sufficient town is a world; it became a model of the Universe. See? It's lost in the Steppe void, brought up by the ancient traditions of our savage people."
538055, "Whoa! That's some big words."
538056, "Good day to you."
538057, "Good point, by the way. Judging by the size of your... Abattoir, the production must also be massive; the whole place is supposed to be reeking of bulls!"
538058, "Miraculously, it doesn't. The Abattoir doesn't let the scent of death out. All the stench in Earth comes from the factories. And even that is negligible, really... Well, that's just one of the peculiar quirks of the place."
538059, "I see."
538060, "What exactly do you mean by the 'Town of Beasts'?"
538061, "Just, you know... It's absolutely barbaric. Bulls set the pace there, not people. And the people that work with the beasts aren't really so far ahead of them, evolutionarily speaking."
538062, "I see. So what happened next?"
538063, "Have a good day."
538064, "Three different worlds coexist within the town. Surprisingly, they are all in accord, but it's really startling that they are-and unclear how that's possible."
538065, "I've noticed that too."
538066, "On the other hand, people of the three worlds don't really mix with each other. Though coexisting, traditionally the parts remain separate."
538067, "But what was the foundation stone, so to speak? The Abattoir?"
538068, "Historically, the oldest craft around here was tanning; eventually a group of factories sprouted on the river bank. About eighty years ago that settlement burned away, and then the Abattoir was constructed."
538069, "It was only constructed eighty years ago? Unbelievable! I was sure that was some sort of a megalith..."
538070, "Later on people wanted to refashion it into a factory. There had been some unusual stone formations and caves; they were... repurposed. Yeah, that was quite an eccentric solution. But a clever one, too: no need for complex constructions-just use what nature itself provided you with."
538071, "Repurposed... but not refashioned into a factory? Why?"
538072, "The Kin resisted."
538073, "How in the world is the Kin so mysteriously influential-and yet I've never had the pleasure of meeting it?"
538074, "Wow. It seems that the love for absurd structures is a far more ancient trend in this country than I could ever imagine."
538075, "What about the Abattoir?"
538076, "The access to the Abattoir was restricted, so the Works emerged as a separate complex. All because the Foreman of the Abattoir made a deal with Olgimsky, promising to double the product in exchange for nonintervention into the Abattoir's internal matters."
538077, "What a curious deal. Care to elaborate on that?"
538078, "I don't know any details, really. But rumour has it they've made an agreement. Olgimsky managed to install the current Foreman to the position of the head of the Kin-and the Foreman serves him in exchange, making sure that the whole Kin works for the Bull Project."
538079, "So the profits go to Olgimsky, huh?"
538080, "That's right."
538081, "Hmm..."
538082, "Farewell."
538083, "I'd like to talk some more about the feudal lords. Tell me a little about the three families, please."
538084, "What do you think of the Kains?"
538085, "I have a soft spot for resolute, outstanding, and bold people. Their kind is rare nowadays."
538086, "You're right... the Kains are conquerors by nature. They fear nothing. They're up in arms and ready to overthrow any rules, any dogmas, any taboos. You have that in common with them, don't you? Well... every coin has a flip side."
538087, "And what is that?"
538088, "The Kains are insane. Possessed, like lead performers on the stage. They're cruel; without a moment's hesitation they would sacrifice anything in the world to achieve their brilliant goals. To their credit, their sacrificial list always starts with themselves. lt has always been that way."
538089, "How do you know which way it's always been?"
538090, "Their family goes a long way. It is at least ten centuries old. Might well be that their roots are lost in the depths of time immemorial. People used to be more attuned to magic back then, and a human life used to cost less. Do be careful around them, Bachelor..."
538091, "I appreciate your advice."
538092, "Don't tell me what to do! I will manage my predilections without your help."
538093, "It's not a random passer-by's place to be opinionated about people like us!"
538094, "Nothing good, I suppose. Their notion of communication is rather annoying."
538095, "It is. And their policies are peculiar as well. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to sell the idea to you... I only know that they are very fond of you. It's not easy to win their favour like that."
538096, "Really? And how did I win it?"
538097, "Thanks to Maria, I guess. She has that supernatural intuition of hers, her mother's heritage. She can feel the resolve within you, she can read your intentions; that makes her believe that you're going to help us all. And we-well, we believe along..."
538098, "I appreciate that."
538099, "Believe in yourselves. No one will babysit you."
538100, "Did they send you to me or something?"
538101, "Of course not... They would never do anything like that."
538102, "Then mind your own business, my good man."
538103, "Who in particular?"
538104, "I mean the family as a whole... Their agenda."
538105, "And what is the Kains' agenda?"
538106, "They make our childhood dreams come true."
538107, "An eccentric course."
538108, "What do you care?"
538109, "I don't care much about them. In fact, I don't care much about any of you. The disease is the only creature that has my interest around here."
538110, "Keep your chin up, citizen."
538111, "All of us will have to make a sacrifice in the end. Our town is like an aerostat: we were bold enough to take off the ground-and that means someone will inevitably have to fall down..."
538112, "Maybe there'll be no need for sacrifices. I'm on the verge of victory already!"
538113, "Maybe, may well be... But many of us would like to see the highlight of our achievement to live on... as a monument to our feat, if nothing else. If something has to be destroyed, let it be something recoverable."
538114, "Why are you telling me this?"
538115, "Because I care! And I'm not the only one. Let the utopians live, Bachelor! Life and death are in your hands now! Save the utopians' lives, even if they are not to your liking. For it is through their deeds that we achieve immortality."
538116, "I intend to do just that."
538117, "Who do you call utopians?"
538118, "And what is your idea of 'the highlight of your achievement'?"
538119, "Everything that the utopians have created. The tangible memorial, the evidence of the human ability to make dreams come true; the proof that you only need to overcome your fear, misery, and inertia to do that. "
538120, "Who do you call utopians?"
538121, "I'd consider at least a third of the town's population utopians. Painters and labourers, men of property and beggars, young and old. The utopians are those who believe in the power of the human spirit and the infinite scope of creativity. Take care of such people, Bachelor. Let them live."
538122, "I'll do everything that's in my power."
538123, "Huh, and let the others die, I suppose?"
538124, "Not you, I hope?"
538125, "Farewell."
538126, "No, thank you."

538128, "Good morals and luck are a great help in managing a small community without resorting to violence. Personal standing can work wonders."
538129, "What do you mean?"
538130, "I like our town. We're all one big family. But sometimes I get the feeling that we're all controlled by an unseen power, our actions but fiction."
538131, "It's quite possible. "
538132, "You are lucky. "
538133, "No. It's pie in the sky."

538136, "Anything I can help you with?"
538137, "Have you been given the vaccine? "
538138, "Tell me, what is a vaccine? "
538139, "A protective agent."
538140, "But how does it work?"
538141, "It's a weakened specimen of the disease that our body can fight off. After you've suffered through the process, the body becomes resistant to it."
538142, "So vaccination provides permanent protection?"
538143, "It usually does."
538144, "Then why does the vaccine circulating around the town only grant temporary protection? The 'black ampulas' and 'blue ampulas', I mean? People are willing to sell their souls for them, and still..."
538145, "Because it's not a vaccine. It is an experimental sample. The body fights it for a while, but then it stops."
538146, "Will you ever be able to make a real one?"
538147, "Maybe."
538148, "You see, my father used to deliver mail. It's a huge risk. His health is badly damaged by the abundance of various chemicals. He's coughing blood and has a constant headache... He's been bed-ridden for two days in a row. I'm so worried about him!"
538149, "So he's a postman?"
538150, "A courier, more like... he delivers messages and small parcels. People are staying in, so they use courier services whenever they can."
538151, "People like your father help to maintain order. They make our job easier."
538152, "What's his profit though?"
538153, "It pays rather well-the rulers are seeing to it. I also know that some people-like my father, for example-have chosen this line of work out of sense of obligation. It was only later that the Kains offered a reward for it-and he didn't refuse, of course..."
538154, "People like him deserve to have a real vaccine. I'll start working on it today."
538155, "Yes, that's commendable."
538156, "I'm doing everything I can."
538157, "You should thank me for having this one!"
538158, "Where did you get these samples anyway?"
538159, "They're being sold on the black market. I don't know where they came from, but rumour has it that they're made by you personally... We are so, so grateful!"
538160, "It wasn't just me."
538161, "You are wrong. Doctor Rubin made them."
538162, "It depends on the disease."

538168, "Would you kindly mend my clothes, my dear?"
538169, "You've got a curious town here... I never expected to see something like this in such a remote place."
538170, "Everyone's tired of the endless construction work. We want some quiet."
538171, "Is there a lot of construction going on?"
538172, "Not a lot, but I cannot shrug away the feeling that the world is changing all too quickly. The rulers invite architects from the Capital, and they turn everything upside down... It's fun for the children, but a torment to us. "
538173, "I'm sorry to hear that."
538174, "You have a very tidy little town. I haven't seen something like this for a long time. "
538175, "Doesn't it have a positive side? "
538176, "Of course it does... Estate is never lacking, and the constant construction projects provide workplaces. Still, we want some quiet."

538181, "Why would they immediately rush looking for an undead... something?"
538182, "Victoria was a Mistress... Somehow it seemed that an ordinary creature couldn't hurt her. Her death was unexpected, she was very young. And so well-loved by the people... So the rumours started immediately that a bayun maneater has taken her soul."
538183, "So what, did they try to seize every fifth man too?"
538184, "No... No one was seized. But there was an anxiety. There was no doubt that an evil was walking among us. You can always feel it, it changes the... density of the world. Your instincts just tell you that it's true. This is all old Steppe wisdom... and you can't avoid it, you really can't. The Steppe is wiser than we are."
538185, "Superstitions like this have thrown sand in the wheels of countless scientific discoveries..."
538186, "Nothing to be done about it. "
538187, "What the hell... "
538188, "Who is Victoria? "
538189, "It was arrested, I hope?"
538190, "Do you have enough food?"
538191, "Oh, we're absolutely miserable... the last of it has run out completely. We're starving, no less! How can it be? Why? People can go for forty days without food... "
538192, "Starvation weakens the body. That's why."
538193, "But the prices, just look at the prices! It's unheard of! A piece of stale bread costs a thousand. Where am I supposed to get that much money? How do they live with their conscience and demand that much of me when my children are starving!"
538194, "Are you really that low on provision?"
538195, "Oh, what a fool I was! And I'm not the only one... So much has been burnt and buried... We were afraid that the meat, the oat, the fish, potatoes-that it could all be infected... The day before yesterday and the day before that, we did... We didn't know that the train wouldn't come, and we just threw it all away! We expected new safe food to come."
538196, "The train might come soon."
538197, "No it won't... Who in their right mind would send a train here? There's a quarantine. Thanks to you!"
538198, "You make it sound like it was I that had ordered to block the town off."
538199, "Not true. It's not about me at all. The quarantine is a desperate measure."
538200, "Sanitary trains are exempt from the quarantine."
538201, "You did the right thing. Starving is better than dying of infection."
538202, "Profiteering always goes hand in hand with catastrophe."
538203, "You're not starving. You're dying of exhaustion."
538204, "Man's share is harder."

538207, "So here we are... Once again, no one's asking us... Got a smoke?"
538208, "Take a look here. Can you repair this... device for me? It keeps missing the target from three yards away. And sharpen this blade too."
538209, "Hey, factory man, how about fixing this barrel for me? And sharpen the knife too."
538210, "Look. This gun must be ancient. It keeps misfiring. Can you fix it?"
538211, "Who are you? Tell me about yourself."
538212, "Me? Well, eh, I'm... a factory worker... The owner treats us like dirt though. Well, I got me my own house... otherwise I would've been stuck in that husk with the rest of 'em. No going out, not even to buy bread! You just sit there gnawing at what you've stockpiled beforehand. They're completely off their rocker..."
538213, "What are you talking about? "
538214, "The Termitary! And why? For what sins? Did we not handle the workload well enough? That might be so... But still, what are we to do now? Nah, home is best. Feels nice to have one."
538215, "I can appreciate that..."
538216, "Moreover, living as a commune is warmer, yeah... mutual support, team spirit, all that... But when you've got one bite and a thousand mouths, one gulp and a thousand throats, support becomes irrelevant. They're starving and therefore getting weak... "
538217, "You don't seem to be starving here."
538218, "We don't seem to be? How about you take off your big-city goggles, eh? Just take a peek inside the Termitary-you'll turn your nose up at it in a split sec! That's where they SEEM TO BE starving all right! The train is two weeks off schedule! Yeah, it works fine for them provident squirrels. The rest are on their hunkers."
538219, "So stocking up was the right choice. Good for them squirrels."
538220, "Kindly stop shouting."
538221, "It will all work out."
538222, "Have you seen anything suspicious? "
538223, "They keep going after the wrong people... What about you, doc? Can you tell a maneating mara when you see her? She's absolutely cruel... And everyone's going mad for her..."
538224, "A maneating what?"
538225, "Everybody's looking for a mara... Well, they say no one believes in her, but everyone's keeping an eye over their shoulder... You know how they paint mara? There's a girl warming her hands up, with her hair loose, all lithe and nimble, and then she bends back, peeks at you, and bam! Her face is all twigs. Heh heh..."
538226, "So you believe in this kind of monster?"
538227, "No, c'mon, I'm an adult man... On the other hand, pigs fly 'n all, y'know? If Simon can live for two hundred years, why can't a mara suck his life out? Using her twigs as sipping straws... Heh heh..."
538228, "You are all borderline feral here."
538229, "You're a funny man, pop."
538230, "Seems like recognizing her is very simple."
538231, "Heh, hopefully... There was this guy five years ago too, said he'd recognize her easily too. And she walked by him-or maybe behind him-right to his very house. He closed the door behind him, but she slipped in. And, well... four coffins of the front porch. And yesterday, too..."
538232, "What about yesterday?"
538233, "You should all stay in. Go home."
538234, "I'll know her when I see her."
538235, "What is it, pop? Do you want to ask me something?"
538236, "So uh... Have you defeated the foe? Found the root of evil? I mean, like, by the way, there was an accident once... happened to a mate of mine... "
538237, "I'm all agog. What happened to this worthy man? "
538238, "So, you see, he broke a leg once, right? Also got himself kidney pains-it was early spring, March or so. And so he went off to gather them worts, 'twas high time for them. Said he'd sell 'em so that they're made into potions... that is, twyrine. Otherwise they're pretty worthless..."
538239, "Wait a minute... he went to gather worts with a broken leg? "
538240, "That's the point-that's the point when he broke it! Obviously he went to gather herbs unbroken! Running around regardless of whether you're even whole or all in pieces is a modern thing. Things used to be different back then... "
538241, "So what does it have to do with the turnskin?"
538242, "Stop interrupting me then! He wandered far off-darkness fell 'n all. So he thought he should get back. And then he feels like something has grabbed his leg. And it's all dark! So he thought that maybe he's grabbed too many herbs 'n roots, so the earth wouldn't let him go. He took the best ones too, the juiciest..."
538243, "Well, what was it? "
538244, "He looks down-and there's something holding him, something hand-like... like a hand. Doesn't seem like a root at all, holding him fast, trying to get to his ankle. And then he sees that it's a bone hand, for real! So 'twas him, the shabnak! And so my mate tried to break free and run off. Came back home and saw that his leg was broken..."
538245, "I see. So why the hell did you feel the need to waste my time telling me all this?"
538246, "Well, he got sick, right? So 'tis all medical stuff. You're a medic. It's a useful story for you, see?"
538247, "You moron... "
538248, "Thank you, good sir. Thank you."
538249, "Why are you telling me all this rubbish, good sir?"
538250, "What are you trying to say? Be quick!"
538251, "So?"
538252, "Get out of my way, will you? I'm not in the mood."
538253, "How are you feeling, good sir? "
538254, "Yeah, exactly, I've been looking all over for you. I need to tell you something. You're a doc, so 'tis your line of work."
538255, "Well, what do you need? "
538256, "The Works are idle-did you know? They say you've banned all the works. Why are they working in the Tin Workshop then? Who are they canning? Huh? So they're free to work whenever they feel like it and we're supposed to starve?"
538257, "What are you talking about? "
538258, "Pff... And you claim to be in charge here. You don't know a thing. The Works are closed off, right? Right. No benefits paid. We've got hunger pangs all over, but that's fine, we can see why. It's a sanitary measure 'n all... equal for everyone. So why is the Tin Workshop working?"
538259, "What do they produce there?"
538260, "They can meat there, that's what! So what do we do now? Who are they canning? Each other? Beef is prohibited-all right, it makes sense. It's no good sending our infected meat all over the country! But if it's safe, why ain't we working?"
538261, "You're not working for your own sake. Stay home and have some rest."
538262, "It's you who can rest at home! We have little children at home! All of 'em hungry! We don't fear no pests, just let us earn something!"
538263, "Go to Olgimsky with that."
538264, "There's an outbreak of a deadly disease in the town! Find a way to cope with your vacation, will you? If only because of the epidemic. You work dork..."
538265, "Silly rumours, nothing more. What makes you think the workshop is active?"
538266, "Don't you hear the noise when you walk by? Or do you think they're rolling cannon balls there?"
538267, "They are. Go home and await further instructions."
538268, "They're dismantling equipment."
538269, "It wasn't I who shut the Works down."
538270, "Exactly. They're free to work and you're supposed to starve."
538271, "I don't have time for this."
538272, "You look the opposite of upbeat, you worker-born-and-bred... which is to say, beat up."
538273, "The patrolmen have gone absolutely berserk! The cunts are beating 'n kicking everything that moves! They don't care about order, methinks, they're just beating 'n kicking for the sake of beating and kicking."
538274, "They do as governor Saburov orders them to."
538275, "Aye, you go ahead 'n find the bloke they are obeying! When they go to The Rod to do their reporting, they're obeying all right, but out on duty they only care for their free-for-all. 'N taking bribes, too!"
538276, "Bribes? For what?"
538277, "Look, here: they got pills, right? Right. That's point one. They beat us lot dead for nothing, right? Right. That's point two. 'N if any of us wants to go here or there? There goes point three..."
538278, "Are they letting the infected out of their designated areas?"
538279, "Aye, and why not if the sum's hefty? Use your big-city brains, big-city man! You take a look at them, looking good, honest 'n all, standing there risking their lives. But if you take a closer look, they're all muggers 'n bloodsuckers, all of 'em! We know them, they're the same as us-people of the Steppe, working people... Not your head-in-the-clouds type."
538280, "Are you aware of any particular incidents? Has anyone been caught red-handed?"
538281, "Ha ha ha... Caught? Nay, that's not how it works! I was just saying that they know no limits. Same killers, just wearing uniforms, that's what they are. Unfairness is an ingrained part of human nature. Can't hide that under a uniform."
538282, "I believe the patrolmen are honest people."
538283, "That's true."
538284, "If I find out that they're conniving at breaking the quarantine, they're dead."
538285, "You go talk to the governor, make him let us beat 'em if we catch 'em stealing or extorting!"
538286, "That is not an option. You will use it as an excuse to beat them for any reason."
538287, "They have volunteer immunity."
538288, "Stop whining, they are doing everything they can."
538289, "You're right! So give them what they deserve!"
538290, "The patrols maintain order in the streets. They are a necessary evil."
538291, "Why are you proletarians outside? Aren't you scared of the infection? "
538292, "Rumour has it the Termitary is all dandy and shiny now... How's that? Do they know a remedy or something?"
538293, "Why are you so sure? "
538294, "The commandant of the Termitary, Tycheek, had a daughter. When she returned, they all cared for her as if she was a pretty little doll! Sugary sweet. And followed her words, too... She's a smart one though, no fooling 'round-she only talked sense... "
538295, "What does the commandant's daughter have to do with this?"
538296, "The little dove must have saved them! They humoured the lil' weakling, nurtured her like a lil' baby dove, they were all aflutter... 'N so they were rewarded! They can't all be beastworms, methinks. Got a soul in them too..."
538297, "Life takes different forms."
538298, "I shall get in there sooner or later! "
538299, "They followed her words? "
538300, "That they did-she only needed say a single word, and it'd all be done! She wouldn't even finish what she'd be saying, and it'd all be done anyway. She could tell 'em to burn water-and they would. But she's a smart lil' lass, she's not abusing it... "
538301, "So you think she told them not to be sick-and now they aren't?"
538302, "Says who?"
538303, "Wenches do... They're all in league with one another, the folk inside, I mean... As for the meat thrown out of the windows and the bloody rags, that's all smoke and mirrors, they say, so that no one would try to get inside..."
538304, "And the rags are just dyed, right?"
538305, "Dunno, it can all be idle gossip... But them wenches say 'tis all fine there... "
538306, "And you're all too eager to repeat after them..."
538307, "I wish it were."
538308, "Tell me, why is the slaughterhouse here top secret?"
538309, "Well, er... 'tis been like that since olden times! It's one whale of a building, see? Ancient, too. It was built even before men came here, before the glaciers came, too. It was a place of rite... they used to feed the earth there. She's the foundation of every birth and burst, she's the mother. Her depths are endless... "
538310, "So? What does it have to do with the Abattoir?"
538311, "They've been dealing in bulls here since times immemorial, too. And bull rites are complicated-a bull is not a common beast, he's the baby child of Mother Steppe! He deserves respect. So they've built this giant temple. For the rite."
538312, "So it's a ceremonial construction? Is it a place of worship still?"
538313, "A cere-what-tion...? Worship, yeah, they do worship bulls still. The cut them by the rite, bury them by the rite-we factory men only get like half the meat. Where does the rest go? To the rite! Vlad the owner respects 'em, so they respect him back and fulfill the quota."
538314, "You savages... this is ridiculously backwards!"
538315, "So they've got a mutual agreement? Right... "
538316, "What kind of rite? "
538317, "The proper one... They bring him bull in with a song, thank him, clean him, honour him; draw things on him, too. Then they butcher him quietly and respectfully. When they're carving him, it's like children playing-this piece goes here, that one goes there, one for the warmth, one for the harvest..."
538318, "Have you seen it yourself? "
538319, "No... Like I would be allowed to..."
538320, "You savages... this is ridiculously backwards!"
538321, "So that's all idle fairytales then."
538322, "You seem to be far from desperate."
538323, "Well yeah... The sanitary train is arriving soon, they say. It'll bring medicine and take the sick away to be cured. If only we could last till it comes... And when does it come, I wonder?"
538324, "Yeah, in your dreams."
538325, "We were told it would come, so it will. Doctors will come bringing drops and poultices. They'll help everyone. I hope they'll be here in time to save the sick! Their fortune ain't all that shiny otherwise-they are goners in five hours without them pills... "
538326, "Their supply is short. You will get neither drops nor poultices anyway."
538327, "Of couse I will, everyone will. The Powers That Be got it all figured out. And if the population's lower, that means we're on the safe side. Got more than enough."
538328, "Well, we shall hope."
538329, "Pray that they manage to save one tenth of the population."
538330, "Just don't trample one another when it arrives. "
538331, "Soon, pop. There will be a train for all of you soon."
538332, "What do you say, oh wise old man? "
538333, "Fall, fall all around! It's all the fall's fault... Fall means crud, crud 'n ungliness. Last year my good-mother's rooster died, the year before that I got myself a cold back. And cattle won't come... Fall ain't good for your condition."
538334, "About the cattle... How is this business organized here? "
538335, "They are brought from the Steppe. Bulls won't come on their own, they're pampered creatures. You gotta know your way around a bull. The herdsmen, the odonghs, go after them. And then they bring them back... Some of them bring a single beast, others-a dozen or even a hundred... then we nurture them here..."
538336, "Has anyone seen dead animals around here recently? "
538337, "No, no! They do not die. If it's all Sand Pest, not a single bull will die of it. When was it...? Oh yeah, five years ago! None of the bulls died too. And I don't think anyone was sick among those who look after 'em."
538338, "So bulls do get sick, but they don't die?"
538339, "This is not my business, really... I've no idea if they get sick or not-all I know is there was no plague among them. And their caretakers were fine too... No, no, it couldn't have come from them. It couldn't. The hides, the meat... who works it all? We do. So I know what I'm talking about."
538340, "I concur-doesn't seem like it comes from bulls. But the coincidence is weird... "
538341, "Oh blessed innocence... I wish I was so sure."
538342, "Are they immune?"
538343, "Why don't you breed them here? "
538344, "Well, that ain't the right thing to do... that would go against their custom. So what? Our job is canning meat. They can breed 'em however they like. Perhaps there is a pasture of theirs deep in the Steppe-and that's where they come from."
538345, "So do bulls die?"
538346, "A stunning syllogism... You should follow my instructions rather than getting engaged in philosophical speculation about health. Your lot is supposed to stay in!"
538347, "Why do you all keep wandering about! Or are the deliveries irregular? "
538348, "Oi, mate, mate! Stop. Gotta talk to you. Smoke?"
538349, "No thank you. What do you want to talk about?"
538350, "Recently I heard that the factory workers are supposed to get free boots... or something? To get the pest off their feet, 'cause it comes through them feet! Well hey, I'm a factory man, I can fashion myself a passport too if you want. My good-father is a factory man too, 'n my good sister is eligible for them benefits too, her being big with child 'n all..."
538351, "Stop gabbling! What boots?"
538352, "Protective boots! So that the disease wouldn't infiltrate them feet along with all kinds of dampness 'n all. They say they help-the shoes or boots or whatever, y'know, those rough ones. And you don't even have to take them pills-cause their prices bite... How much does a single one cost? I won't make this much in a year! And boots come for free... don't they?"
538353, "ээ"
538354, "But the disease comes from the ground! The ground! It rises up with the steam 'n fog and infiltrates your feet with the moisture. 'Tis her, 'tis her, the shabnak-she crawls from below the ground, grabbing your legs! The folk wisdon it totally right! That's how it is!"
538355, "Please, I'm almost begging you, just stay in! It won't get to you through the floor, will it?"
538356, "Why are you so sure that it comes from the ground? "
538357, "... Everybody says it does. Every-body. You are the only one who doesn't know! "
538358, "..."
538359, "You are supposed to be delivered free pills."
538360, "What? Where? Everything gets stolen and falls into the wrong hands! We barely got enough for them wenches yesterday. Did anyone bring us a single shoddy pill yesterday? Eh? It's not like we've got a ton stocked away-'n did you see what train that we got? It'd bring medicine, they said. 'It'll bring doctors.' Yeah right, like five cartrige clips of medicine per doctor! Helps with any disease!"
538361, "Yeah... just in time."
538362, "You know what? To hell with you and with your whole family! "
538363, "I am not your mate. Get lost."
538364, "What's the news on the street?"
538365, "Have you heard? There's a fight among them goons. Serves them right. That's what you get for poking 'n prying 'n being totally unwelcome here!"
538366, "A fight?"
538367, "Their chief guy, like the mortar-man, won't let them plunder 'n rob. He's young... and he kept 'em in check. Not for the life of him, he says! 'Don't you dare steal a single button, you'll get all court-martialled that instant!' So they got unhappy with him. And then rose against him... So they're all fighting one another now."
538368, "So Block turns out to be a person of exceptional morals... I should support him."
538369, "Indeed, serves them right. "
538370, "What goons? "
538371, "Them army goons! Started beating the living pulp out of one another, 'tis all a mess, you can't make out friend from foe there... although somehow they do. Oh soldier boys..."
538372, "What happened? "
538373, "Ah, so that's what you're talking about... "
538374, "They'll sort it out without you, pop."
538375, "What do you want, pop?"
538376, "So you're, like, the very main guy now, right? And they'll do to us whatever you tell 'em to?"
538377, "Not the very main, no."
538378, "I don't think so... I think you are the very main. Him general guy is all docile and doing like you say. Says he respects your scientific opinion. So he'll do as you tell him. And his orders are to eradicate everything here, raze it all down, and leave no trace behind."
538379, "Where are you going with this?"
538380, "I'm going to say that 'tis within your power now to have your way with us as you please, and any wrongdone sin that comes of it is also yours. Perhaps it'll all settle down somehow? What are your orders?"
538381, "I shall act justly."
538382, "My orders are to eradicate the infection. And since it's you who's infectious..."
538383, "Well, those are very valid orders."
538384, "That's right. "
538385, "Prepare for an evacuation. The uninfected should gather at the Station. "
538386, "So there's only one option? To the ground with us all?"
538387, "I will see to it so that evacuating everyone before the bombardment is the topmost priority. You will be put on the train, placed under quarantine, and taken elsewhere."
538388, "Quarantine my ass... I know how they quarantine people-they take you into the field, put you on your knees and only waste a single bullet... We ain't going anywhere! There's nothing for us elsewhere. Here's our home, our land... no way. You cannot have my consent, sir."
538389, "My duty is to prevent the disease from spreading. The only way to do it is by wiping the town off the map."
538390, "Fine. Fulfill your duty then, you bloodsucker... Go ahead."
538391, "I will. "
538392, "I won't raze the town. The Inquisitor supports me."
538393, "That's to be expected from the addled bitch. She's saving her own skin pretending to care for us..."
538394, "Shush."
538395, "There are no options."
538396, "Sorry, I don't smoke."
538397, "The Address to the Townspeople/n/nAttention all citizens! Following the outbreak of a lethal disease commonly known as 'Sand Plague', 'Sand Pest', and 'Sand Dirt', the town authorities hereby declare state of emergency./n/nThe disease is extremely contagious. There is still ongoing research as to how the disease is transmitted, but cases of contact and droplet infection have been confirmed. There are currently no vaccine solutions in the town and none are to be expected before the regular train arrives. Please be extra careful!/n/nThe townspeople are forbidden to leave their homes unless under special instruction. Remember: the possibility of infection is much lower for those who stay indoors. The citizens are advised to sterilise their household wares, boil their clothing, and exterminate as many vermin as possible./n/nDo not panic! Medics, couriers and executors will take care of mail delivery, as well as the distribution of drinking water, provisions and medicine. Requests should be written down and slid under the door for couriers to collect./n/nThis address was composed on the instructions of Bachelor Dankovsky and ratified by the State of Emergency Town Governor Alexander Saburov. It is compulsory to follow every advice herein."
538398, "EPIDEMIC (Written on Your Recommendation; Sent for Approval)"
538399, "The Annotation for Patrolmen, Couriers, Executors and Sanitary Personnel/n/nIn order to prevent panic, this annotation is classified and its contents should be under no circumstances disclosed to the civilian population./n/nThe disease is incurable. There is no vaccine, neither here nor in the Capital. However, there are a few positive facts:/n/n1. The probability of contracting the disease is significantly lower for someone who has taken immune system stimulants. As of now we believe that A-pills and B-pills (yellow coloured and blue coloured pills, respectively) provide the best protective effect. Excessive doses of these medicants may be detrimental to one's health./n/n2. Additional protection is afforded by synthetic clothing. Woolen garments are strictly off limits (parasites). The clothing should be changed as often as possible./n/n3. IMPORTANT! The disease develops sporadically. At its initial stage, it does not progress in any significant way, especially if antibiotics are taken. However, if contact with the infection reoccurs, the development of the disease becomes extremely rapid./n/n4. The disease is not transmitted by means of droplet infection. As of now, we've yet to find out how it is contracted. Preliminary tests suggest that the disease is not contagious at early stages, therefore there is no need to isolate the sick person immediately after the appearance of the symptoms./n/nApp. The Executors:/n/nIn consideration of your particular line of work, we believe that you will not be able to avoid infection. If you have contracted the disease, do not give in to despair. It would have happened sooner or later anyway. Try your best to conserve the infection at its initial stage. Take antibiotic medicine. Consider using the 'shmowders': they are extremely dangerous, but they help curb the infection."
538400, "CONFIDENTIAL NOTATION (Written on Your Recommendation; Sent for Approval)"
538401, "The following sanitary precautions are hereby announced:/n/nThere are citizens-so-called 'Bound'-who seem to be extraordinarily involved in town happenings. They are regularly contacted by people of different lines of occupation and social standing, including your two colleagues. They also try to compensate what they believe to be your inaction with their own efforts. In consideration of that, the Executor Committee has decided:/n/n1. If a Bound person falls ill, the door to their home should be guarded by an Executor./n/n2. While the Bound person remains conscious, the Executor should collect mail deliveries from them and pass over to them the provisions and medicaments delivered by the couriers./n/n3. In exceptional cases it is allowed to visit the patient. To enable communication with the Bound person, the Executor should resort to higher efficiency antibiotic medicine (feromycinum)./n/n4. Vaccines, serums, and other such solutions should be administered, if available, in the same manner as all of the above./n/nExecutors Committee"
538402, "OF THE BOUND FALLEN ILL"
538403, "The time has come. She is calling for you. If our hopes come true, the new Mistress will return to the town, and in so doing, signify the end of the pestilence./n/nWe put our trust in you. We love you./n/nN. and S."
538404, "Invitation from the Kains "
538405, "The truth reveals itself to me, oynon. I have claimed my father's grievous inheritance. I have made my choice./n/nI believe that the settlement can be saved. It is alive. The Kin still lives, even though my father, who was destined to lead it, has died. The Kin is nourished and sustained by the earth. The earth that knows how to breathe. A new harvest may be nurtured here./n/nI devote my life to service of the Kin, just as the lines of my family enjoin me to. I will change this town; it will be reborn to live anew. Victoria Olgimskaya, the White Mistress, will breathe life into it. The fallen families will be replaced by those marked by the sign of the spirits. Children they are, Taya Tycheek, Chieftain Notkin, blessed Grace, urchins Murky and Sticky, and, possibly, one more whom I did not yet get to meet. He goes by the name of Khan./n/nIf they survive-so will the town. If you want the town to live, just like I do, then help me, or at least don't interfere with my actions. Woe is you if any one of the children dies. For they are meant to inherit the earth./n/nArtemy Burakh, the Haruspex"
538406, "The Haruspex's Choice"
538426, "Yes, I've heard about Mistresses. "
538427, "We're not sure if we ought to be happy or sad. The joy could not be greater if she were to become a mother, for today a wondrous creature will be born. But the sorrow is also great. Maria is leaving. We used to have a beloved daughter-and today we're going to lose her."
538428, "She wanted to talk to me, didn't she? "
538429, "It's too late now. Maria is unconscious. Her latest fit came last night. She came to for a brief while-and then fell back into the depths. She will wake up soon. And I believe my daughter will be able to rise from the depths to which she descended."
538430, "Why did she summon me? "
538431, "There used to be three powers in our town. They may not exist anymore, but they have left offshoots. Two more heiresses will become Mistresses when their time comes. One is Capella, Victoria's daughter. I don't know who the other one is. It may be Saburova's successor, but it's not Clara. Clara is pure."
538432, "No. Tell me. "
538433, "You've written that the coming of a Mistress will stop the pestilence. Why? "
538434, "It won't stop it. It will herald it. You will be the one to stop the pestilence, Bachelor Dankovsky. Your path and Maria's run parallel for now-and close to each other, too. One thing I know for sure: when a Mistress comes, the filth will be gone from our lives. They're incompatible."
538435, "A Mistress grants life to anything she touches with her hand, her words, or even her thoughts. Like that ancient king who turned bread, trees, and water into gold with a touch of his hand. But the king's touch turned the living into the dead. A Mistress does the opposite."
538436, "How does it work?"
538437, "That I do not know. I know that it happens, and know that there is no greater joy in the world. A Mistress can hold a toy in her hands, and it will come to life. She can think about it, and the doll will remember its family history to the seventh generation. She can see it in a dream-and the doll will be able to create."
538438, "I see. "
538439, "And Maria is becoming one of such women?"
538440, "I want to see Maria. "
538441, "Then I should leave so that I don't disturb her."
538442, "Someone's tried to assure me recently that such things cannot be grasped. "
538443, "Who are these future Mistresses? "
538444, "The Saburovs had no other successor. Why are you so sure it isn't Clara? "
538445, "Because Clara was here a while ago. She looked me in the eye-and I can tell good from evil all right! No, she is not the Mistress of Earth. She may very well be a true saint. But I can feel where the real Mistress of the Earth is now. She's hiding somewhere in the Termitary."
538446, "All right. Is there something you want me to tell them?"
538447, "I'll gladly do it for her."
538448, "Quite probably. He's the type to get into trouble, you know..."
538449, "If so, then what are you waiting for? Win him back, help him-and he will tell you something that will turn your worldview upside down. You won't need his blueprints afterwards."
538450, "He may be a mad daredevil, but he is also a friend and a peer of mine... I'll help him out. "
538451, "Do you have the blueprints for the Polyhedron? I've seen papers on the table over there... "
538452, "I am indeed powerless, as you can see. I'm accused of having arranged your discovery. I've lost my vote of confidence. So tell them whose discovery it is-for the laurels are yours. Are you in doubt?"
538453, "Your diabolical deception was so simple! The cause and the source-it's so easy to put these very different things together, Inquisitor! But they are not the same!"
538454, "Yes. It's a phenomenon beyond the habitual reality, contradicting the laws of common sense and embodying that which mustn't be known to, felt, and seen by men. And yet it has been created and materialized at human discretion."
538455, "A man strives to be happy, and this is a great blessing. What's so bad about it? "
538456, "Our country holds the absolute record on experimental utopia designs-and this is a feature that should be interpreted as its absolute virtue. Social masterpieces are rare, but they do happen-and they don't have to be accidental."
538457, "Indeed."
538458, "However, somehow they never seem to live too long. Now, at the dawn of the current century, there are almost none left. One gets the impression that there is no contry that would imbue its inhabitants with inner force simply because they happen to inhabit it. There have been examples of this, but they've all been destroyed. Why?"
538459, "I do not know."
538460, "Let's get back to the matter at hand. A wonderful town is suddenly beginning to die. No one knows why. Why this one-the one that has managed to produce a wonder? The most curious, the most mysterious, inhabited by the most talented people? What did they do to deserve this? I'll tell you."
538461, "I'm all ears. "
538462, "At the persistent pleasure of the caprisious Powers That Be, the Miracle that has been accidentally embodied as the Polyhedron is forced to stay there, captured by the flesh of the town that has nurtured it, feeding it with its resources, people, and hot blood. This flesh has become its womb and its prison."
538463, "You're beeing too metaphoric. What does that have to do with my choice? And the epidemic?"
538464, "Enslaved miracles die not out of anyone's malice-that is just their nature. You can't hold a miracle with your hands, you can only hold its corpse. The idea is not new. Let us have a closer look at the Disease, the imbodiment of this logic. Is it good or evil? Why has it come to the Town?"
538465, "It's obviously evil. "
538466, "Why did you come to the town at the same time then? You are by all definitions a hero. A miracle-maker almost. It was the Powers That Be that have tried to make you detain a miracle here... not the poor obsessed Kains. They've only played their part. They represent their own force. But you... do you really want to go back to being a slave? The Powers That Be are bending you to submission according to their own design!"
538467, "You are obsessed with revenge, Aglaya. Revenge is a bad companion in the search for the truth. "
538468, "In this case they are. It's strange that you have failed to see that. This place is a utopia-that is, an abuse of nature. The Utopia must be destroyed. It's evil."
538469, "Mustn't exist?"
538470, "I don't want to talk to you. I despise you. "
538472, "I've already made up my mind. Let's not waste our time on unnecessary speeches."
538473, "No. I don't. I hate them as much as you do, Aglaya. "
538474, "Do you consider it to be good? "
538475, "I already know what you're about to say."
538476, "Yes, I realize this... Who knows how many years will pass before I come into power? Very many, perhaps... And the only thing left for me will be taking up residence in the town Maria will have built and accepting the place she will have appointed to me... if there is one. So it cannot be changed now, can it?"
538477, "It can't."
538478, "Well... I was so close... But the town is better off with a Dark Mistress than with none at all. We cannot stall any longer. Especially since 'dark' doesn't really mean 'evil'. And Nina wasn't a Dark Mistress, she was the Mistress of the Night. They even called her Scarlet. Scarlet Nina, Scarlet Maria."
538479, "Do you acknowledge her power?"
538480, "Here, give Maria my beads. This jewellery belonged to my mother. An antique work made of the bone of a steppe bull. These bulls are extinct now... Here-see?-the protective brands are carved upon the spikes. I acknowledge her power. Ler her reign better than Wild Nina did."
538481, "What are you talking about? "
538482, "If only it was possible to wait just a little... I could lead everybody down a very different path. It would be so much better."
538483, "I'm a doctor. You can rely on my coat being dirt-free."
538484, "I need to get inside. "
538485, "You will not. The only person we trust is Maria, our sister and patroness. Khan's word. You do not look like her messenger. "
538486, "What proof do you need? "
538487, "Say the password. "
538488, "But I do look like a person whom Victor trusts. "
538489, "Tell him that there was a man who needed to get into the Agate Pit."
538490, "He is a nimble one, the Youngling... He crawled into the Kin's heart like a snake, got us webbed, got to know us, he started talking to Wardens... Oh yeah, he had that kind of power."
538491, "Well... Now he'll tell me everything I'd want to know. That'll sour his arrogant attitude quite a bit."
538492, "Now I'll have something to talk to Vlad the Younger about... He'll tell me about his business all right. In every bloody detail!"
538493, "Capella told me my fate was linked to that of these peculiar children. Apparently, they stood beside my father as he was breathing his last. I need to talk to Notkin and Grace about it. I also have to pay another visit to my father's house, since the children seem to have frequented it."
538494, "Are you out of your mind?"
538495, "Not at all. They know what they're getting into. It's horrible, yes... but it also happens at their own request. No one's forcing their hand-and we're offering sizable compensations to the testers' families. It's a fortune for a poor worker."
538496, "Yes, a reasonable course of action."
538497, "I do. I'll take the drugs from the young ladies and test them myself. Hopefully, you can trust my words just as well."
538498, "Yulia, this is nonsense! As far as I know, a disease of this sort can't possibly be cured by this kind of antibiotics."
538499, "You are not wrong here... Still, I'd rather go with my own assumptions. Not unlike yourself, I base my speculations on rigorous research, even though it may not look veritable enough to you. You see, in order to calculate the probability of either outcome, I had to extrapolate the two mathematical functions, which you may find to be somewhat... esoteric."
538500, "I have a better proposal. You see, I would be very interested to study these shmowders myself-and I think I am better equipped to do it. Give the shmowder to me and I will handle the testing."
538501, "Pardon me, but I have my own prospects regarding the shmowder."
538502, "Oh, leave out those courtesies, will you?"
538503, "...and she said, 'I made a mistake, for I wanted to do the right thing, but instead I have lost my gifts, exhausted my powers and dissolved into the crowd of simple people. I need to go into hiding now, to avoid their false accusations. An alarm bell can be seen from the window of the house where I find shelter. The air is glowing-hot all around it. Before long it will toll heavily over Gorkhon.'"
538504, "She spoke to me in a dream..."
538505, "...looking scared and miserable. She said, 'They persecute me, they hunt me, they try to track me down. They are so close to capturing me that I had to change my hideout four times in a single day. I am covering up here, at the brink of the town, where they won't find me so easily. From the windows I see two bonfires being lit-are they trying to smoke me out? Are they going to put a watcher atop the ruined stairway surrounded by columns?'"
538506, "She appeared before me in a dream..."
538507, "...and although she was covering her face with her hands, I saw that her lips were oozing blood. I saw blood trickling from beneath her eyelids and glittering in the cracks of her dessicated palms./n/nI heard her mumble through her fingers, 'This is not the crowd that seeks me now, not these mindlessly fervent people I came to love so much, not them, but two demons, two destroyers, armed to their teeth and devoid of human compassion! They hate me even more than they loathe each other, they want nothing more than my death.'/n/n'...They will capture me, make me an object of trade, they will pay generously in silver and blood to learn where I am and tear me limb from limb. The names of the demons are Artemy, spawned by the Heat of the Earth, and Daniil, begotten by the cold Celestial Flame...'/n/n'...from my window I saw each one of them bring a butcher down within the flaming Suok Ring. They are fighting each other now, but neither will win the fight...'"
538508, "I saw her in a dream once again..."
538509, "...saying, 'Who has betrayed me? Who has led them to my hiding place? Would I have known where to conceal myself next, were it not for the warning of my faithfuls who brought me inside? For my enemies gathered everyone they could and surrounded my shelter. Would I have escaped were it not for my miraculous powers?'/n/n'...In that three-sided yard, my faithfuls saw me from high above and set out to rescue me, protect me and give me shelter. For they have witnessed the miracles I have shown them and were convinced by my righteous deeds...'"
538510, "As I woke up, I heard her voice..."
538511, "...she was all tortured and torn. All she did was look at me; she didn't say a word this time. She was hiding in the house yet again, cowering in the corner, away from the windows. The crowd was roaring outside. They shouted, they made all manner of racket... but this time it wasn't her they were after./n/nThey were celebrating the arrival of the bull that appeared unexpectedly in the middle of an empty lot. Some of them screamed that the Bos has risen from beneath the ground. The others shouted that it came down from heaven only to be pierced by the stake that was prepared for it down below."
538512, "I dreamt of her tonight, just like the night before..."
538513, "...for as soon as my eyes were shut she appeared before me. 'They have betrayed me,' she said, 'My faithfuls have given me up. I only have you now, my soul, my inseparable connection...'/n'...I would have asked you to join me, but I have no notion of where my feet have taken me. Frightened, I fled the Theatre. I ran down the stairs and came to a place which seemed hard to stumble upon. I concealed myself there, in a small house between the two larger ones... There is no way I can come near the windows, and there is no one here to answer my cries...'/n'...Find me, come visit me and comfort me. In return I will comfort you...'"
538514, "It was just as if she was waiting for me..."
538515, ""
538516, "Being here is such a torment... this place is cold, gloomy, full of pain, and worst of all, devoid of the slightest warmth or comfort... How can anyone be made to suffer this for so long? Why did you do this to us? Why don't you just resolve everything already, so we could be out of here?"
538517, "...Who are you?"
538518, "So I've found you at last... sister!"
538519, "I'm no sister of yours! Do you really not recognize me?"
538520, "What, you're my conscience?"

538524, "I'm the one dreaming you... sister. You can't exist! Do you understand that?"
538525, "Then we should part ways quickly before something bad happens... Except I don't want to let you go! Even though I'm afraid to touch you-I feel sorry for you... and hence I love you, my dear sister-maybe more than any living being on this earth!"

538529, "You're so sweet; such eyes... They're not like mine at all."
538535, "And I've been missing you so much..."
538536, "Our hands don't look the same either..."
538538, "You need to leave at once! See, the whole place is infected!"
538539, "You know as well as I do that the infection won't do anything to me. I can't go anywhere now-I'm now hated by those who used to love me. They torture me; they burn me and hurl stones at me... I have to hide..."
538540, "Why is it that any place you visit becomes infected?"
538541, "Go away regardless. I'm asking kindly."
538542, "See, everything's already dead in here. While elsewhere there are people waiting for you."
538543, "No, I'm not going anywhere, dear sister... I'm staying here. I feel better here. Back there, I'm not needed."
538544, "Yes. That's true. I know that there's another place, where the air is still healthy, and where my faithful are waiting for me. They miss me... I'm leaving tonight, to seek refuge with them."
538545, "Oh, how is that my fault? I come here because I need a place to hide from those who are out there hunting me. They've got fire and steel, their henchmen are ferocious-and what do I have to stave them off with? Only this... They're too scared to get closer... Those who've remained faithful to me can't do anything to protect me. "
538546, "Yes. I'm quite fond of the Kains. "
538547, "The Kains will help us-if they are still capable of anything at all, that is-to gather the necessary documents concerning that unusual structure, the Polyhedron."
538548, "Why do you need those documents?"
538549, "Are you joking? How am I supposed to work without documents? Firstly, I need to draw up a so-called 'Inquisitor's argument', which will contain documental evidence providing the rationale for my decision. There could be a Tribunal... and it's not something to be trifled with."
538550, "And secondly...? "
538551, "And secondly, that blasted Block turned out to be not as dimwitted as I expected. He's taking advantage of my youth and weakness and has decided to ascertain the validity of my decisions himself! Without having a shred of understanding, of course! And of course doubting me from the start."
538552, "Very well. What documents do you need?"
538553, "Basically, I need to know what that structure is. I need all documents pertaining to that building. There is probably a connection between its fantastic form and the fantastic events that have taken place."
538554, "That's out of the question. From what I know about the author, he doesn't have much time left. A wild lifestyle, heightened anxiety, alcohol and hallucinogen addiction, obsessive phobias, remarkably intensive neural stress..."
538555, "And yet you were implying something else when mentioning his short life span..."
538556, "What? No. As you are probably aware, yesterday I took that young man under my protection and averted a threat to him... Admittedly, I also implied that people like him are always in danger. Always. Tell me, how long have you known... that man?"
538557, "Not that long. Do you have some... less than apparent information about him?"
538558, "Spot on. On the other hand, Peter is still quite young. He is of the same age as me."
538559, "We've made acquaintance quite some time ago."
538560, "Has he ever told you of the similarities the two of you bear? That you could end up in a position similar to his-and vice versa? That being an inevitable victim of circumstance is the only fate available to a genius? I ask you to be precise. A lot of things hinge on your answer."
538561, "That was a disturbing question... No. He never said that."
538562, "His brother and I were peers... back when we were in university."
538563, "Perhaps. Even if he didn't say those precise words, he certainly could have."
538564, "I was hoping you would explain that to me."
538567, "Everything is in plain sight-it doesn't require a thorough study to see..."
538568, "If you're talking about the disease, then I'll have you know that the Tower is clean. I confirmed that there's no infection."
538569, "Of course, of course... I'm sure it is. That's the first thing I checked out as well... It's squeaky clean."
538570, "No, it's not. I need more time."
538571, "Why do you ask? "
538572, "No. "
538573, "Because they are obviously very fond of you. Maria is in love with you, that's clear as day-even though it makes no sense if my knowledge of her future plans is correct. Victor has gone so far as to entrust you with some final family matter. Georgiy speaks of you with great sympathy."
538574, ""
538575, "What is it? Why are you here? Look how thin my hands have become..."
538576, "I want to talk to you..."
538577, "It's too late! How am I to talk to you now? Look for me in another place now, not far from here... They've killed me. I've been banished."
538578, "But how am I going to find you?"
538579, "Go to sleep. Put a copper coin on each eye..."
538580, "I'll soon go to sleep forever..."
538581, "Indeed..."
538582, "They're no thinner than mine, sister."
538583, "Killed you? You're no more dead than I am. And I am here talking to you..."
538584, "I don't have any copper coins on me..."
538585, "Go away."
538586, "Who are those faithful?"
538587, "You have adherents?"
538588, "Simple folk; commoners, outcasts, non-Bounds. But they've been unafraid of him who's been my only friend all this time, him who's taken the blow for me. They're taking care of him-of this absurd and impossible creature, a living thing made of dead matter. They didn't turn him into a scapegoat for all their sins and murders!"
538589, "It will be better that way, sister..."
538590, "I know who you're talking about. It's that albino. The creature from the Steppe."
538591, "It's a shabnak-adyr, moulded from bones and clay!"
538592, "All right then... Stay here. Don't go anywhere."
538593, "Yes you are. People love you. They think you're a saint."
538594, ""
538595, "Stop it... You hear me... We are leaving... We are leaving..."
538596, "What are you saying? I'm not trying to make you leave..."
538597, "If I have a chance, I'll rat you out to the Bachelor!"
538598, "I just wanted to tell you about the Changeling..."
538599, "We've already sheltered the harbinger... Her persecutors won't have her... Do not get in our way... we are leaving..."
538600, "So I am late!"
538601, "I'll find you tomorrow... that is to say, today."
538602, ""
538603, "We have been waiting for you... harbinger... We believe you... As do many others... I'll gather the rest..."
538604, "Yes. I am the harbinger."
538605, "You have been waiting for the Changeling! She is not the one whom you want to serve! Go away from here and never give her shelter!"
538606, "...Where shall I take you?"
538607, "Take me to any shelter."
538608, "...How do you know who we want to serve...? How are you now a Changeling...?"
538609, "I am the true Clara."
538610, "Well, now... Let us go... Show us your miracle, give us your blessing so that our set-up is never discovered and we are not attacked on the way... Bless our feet, harbinger..."
538611, "An evil demon is hunting my sister-he's sending the pest after her! If you offer her shelter, the disease will be here tomorrow."
538612, "We are not afraid."
538613, "Show us your miracle... Then we'll believe you... and tell the others about who you really are... And they will believe in you too..."
538614, "Go away from here! Or else I-the real me-will lay a curse on you."
538615, "By the power granted to me from above I tell you this: go. You don't need the harbinger."
538616, "Go away from here! Or you will be punished tomorrow. The plague is after me..."
538617, "Here it is. Go ahead and run away when you know I was in the right."
538618, "Here it is. Go ahead and run away when you know I was in the right."
538619, "No... I'm afraid to. It will drain too much of my power. I think I may even die."
538620, "It's beyond my power... One cannot work miracles just to prove they are in the right. The punishment will be awful."
538621, "What are you...? I keep trying to remember... You are like that for a reason!"
538622, "You are the Changeling... We knew someone would come to tempt us..."
538623, "This is the punishment for my impertinence-I dared use my gift for personal gain!"
538624, "I want to try again..."
538625, "Now I see that it really is you... So what you're saying is somebody will appear under your guise and bring us plague?"
538626, "Yes. You have to go."
538627, "Drive her away!"
538628, "We'll wait for her and make her leave this neighbourhood... Tomorrow this district will be clean..."
538629, "Let it be so..."
538630, "Be firm. Drive her away even if she cures someone on front of you!"
538631, "I have proof that I'm not who I've been mistaken for! I've performed a miracle."
538632, "What miracle have you performed?"
538633, "Yesterday I cleansed the Atrium district-the one that borders on the Cathedral! Go and see for yourself."
538634, "Today I banished the disease from the Spleen district. You can check-it will be clean tomorrow!"
538635, "Hm... That could be a simple coincidence."
538636, "Indeed? Meanwhile the information I've got is that the disease is rampant in the Kidneys. What will happen tomorrow? Tomorrow it will be clean, I'm sure. According to the Bachelor, the disease burns out in the space of a day."
538637, "Your Bachelor knows nothing! It doesn't burn out of its own accord, I can assure you! If I didn't do it, the disease would still be there tomorrow."
538638, "So you don't believe me?"
538639, "So you don't believe me?"
538640, "This information needs to be thoroughly checked. If it is indeed the way you describe it, and you're capable of cleansing districts one at a time... I suppose I might even reward you for such feats."
538641, "Test me! You'll see that I'm telling the truth."
538642, "I've cleansed the Spleen district. Are you convinced now?"
538643, "Maybe, maybe... So you think that if not for you, that district would still be infected now?"
538644, "Doubtlessly."
538645, "It all depends on who's been to that district."
538646, "You're a clever little girl... I'll give you that. Well then, carry on with your work. Collect the reward you've been promised. And make sure you remember our deal..."
538647, "I do remember it."
538648, "Our deal? What deal?"
538649, "I've cleansed the Crude Sprawl. You can see for yourself. It's clean."
538650, "Well done, my girl. Here, let me look into your eyes..."
538651, "Look."
538652, "If you're not afraid..."
538653, "Nothing... Except... I've cleansed the Skinner district."
538654, "Very well. I will relay your words to her."
538655, "So what, am I supposed to become one of your Kin then? Thank you, but no."
538657, "That's right. "
538658, "That's not really your business."
538659, "Then speak, oynon. In this, we are on the same side."
538660, "Then I won't aid you. Your lines are not familiar to me. They even cross out mine. Why would I aid you?"
538661, "I'll manage just fine without you, Ripper."
538662, "Very well. I am doing this at the Inquisitor's request. You trust her, don't you?"
538663, "I am sure that these bacteria have a mineral origin. Its origin might be connected to the history of this place."
538664, "The local soil has rather unusual structure. The earth has something akin to an internal crust. Even water can't pass through it. Why?"
538665, "I don't know. That is what I would like to verify."
538666, "I got quite a letter from you... Blackmail, is it?"
538667, "Not at all. Just keeping you informed."
538668, "It sounded like a threat."
538669, "I see."
538670, "Not at all. It sounded like an offer. A favour for you, oynon. A helping hand."
538671, "Have you lost your mind?"
538672, "No. Right now you're on a railway that leads straight into the abyss. While our cars are still aligned, I invite you to jump into the one going across the chasm, not down."
538673, "So you have indeed lost your mind."
538674, "As soon as I get home I'll take to writing you an answer. It'll be more convincing that way, for I have a knack for the epistolary."
538675, "I should be writing letters like that to you, not the other way round."
538676, "Think of what I said, oynon. Oh, and also don't trust the Changeling. She is evil."
538677, "Can't argue with that."
538678, "There's nothing to think about. Everything has already been thought of."
538679, "Why? Please be so kind as to explain yourself."
538680, "No one had any illusions on this account... "
538681, "...A battering ram, to be precise. Although that is also a dubious honour. Why is her goal so insane?"
538682, "Why did you call me a ram then? You were implying I'm a sheep, weren't you? Why does she need me here?"
538683, "She could offer him ten official reports... Inquisitors know how to do that. "
538684, "No. The Commander is smart. Well, perhaps not very smart, but he's very astute when it comes to honour. He'd see the deceit straight away. Aglaya knows that very well. No, she needed you to get at him with your honesty... because you believed you were telling the truth."
538685, "Wait... I need to collect my thoughts... "
538686, "Anyone could play that role, I say!"
538687, "As you can see, you've fit into it perfectly. Bravo! Encore! And your persona was... 'the smartest and the fairest'. Others would have been less convincing in this role. Aglaya wanted to make a precise strike. She couldn't afford to make mistakes."
538688, "...She had Burakh. He trusted her so much... and he's indifferent towards the Tower... "
538689, "Burakh is dead. He fell several hours ago while trying to wrest his inherited rights from Foreman Oyun's hands. The Abattoir has swallowed him. There's only me and you now. Think, Bachelor."
538690, "I don't believe you. I need facts. "
538691, "I don't believe you, Changeling... You cannot be trusted because you always contradict yourself."
538692, "Why should I care for your Maria Kaina? Yesterday I might have been afraid of her. But now I'm beginning to feel my own power. Also I'm not the Mistress of the Earth. She is mistaken."
538693, "Really? "
538694, "My power is not of this world. Do you understand? "
538695, "No, I don't."
538696, "I understand that this is a formality. Maria definitely possesses some kind of magnetism, I acknowledge that. And if the townsfolk care for it, the rest of you-other girls of the same kind but of lesser standing-are supposed to acknowledge her power."
538697, "...Ah, is now really the time to talk about it? So what does this Maria want with me?"
538698, "Nothing special. A simple formality. You must acknowledge her."
538699, "Why have the Kains told that you are not the third Mistress?"
538700, "What? They did? Which one? Victor or Georgiy? This is very important! "
538701, "Victor. "
538702, "Georgiy. "
538703, "Ha! Then it's all bosh. Be on your way, Bachelor. I shall speak to Maria myself... If she wants me to, that is."
538704, "As you wish. But don't expect me to help you... today or tomorrow! Farewell."
538705, "I do not know myself... Yes, they may be right... They were talking about the Mistress of the Earth, after all. Did he say anything about my miracle-making abilities?"
538706, "We will crush you, Changeling. You serve death while Maria serves life. Come round."
538707, "Are you a miracle-maker?"
538708, "No. "
538709, "You take me for another person! "
538710, "Then what is the nature of the power you're beginning to feel?"
538711, "By the way, two days ago I received a little letter from you. What was it supposed to mean?"
538712, "Take it at face value, Bachelor. Nothing has to be broken, believe me! This town is alive! As for you and Haruspex, you are demons, deceived and ruthless; your eyes are white for you are blind; your tongues are red for you thirst for blood; yourselves are invincible for you are hollow! One of you wants to decapitate it, another-to slice away its body!"
538713, "Stop rhapsodizing, Clara. Your tricks are cheap."
538714, "And you? "
538715, "And I will keep everything. Both of you are destined to fail! Both of you will ruin that which can live united. United tragically, but united still! Let them argue, let them deny one another-but that is exactly how it grows! The town is inconceivable without the Tower; the Tower is impossible without the town!"
538716, "How are you going to keep it all? It's impossible. "
538717, "True. It can only happen miraculously. You can't do that. Just trust me-that will be your miracle! Although Burakh doesn't need that anymore... He has paid for his thickness in spades."
538718, "I can do that. You'll see."
538719, "We'll see. Your letter was impressive. If I ever get out of here, I'm going to keep it as a memento of this trip."
538720, "Because of what happened yesterday I can't help but feel worried about you. Please don't rush headlong into your independent investigation. Keep in mind that the army is a force to be reckoned with, and any mistake we make may well be our last./n/nWhat we need to do is to wait and to collate our observations. I will be waiting for you at the Cathedral./n/nInq."
538721, "Aglaya's Invitation"
538722, "I see."
538723, "That's not true. The final remedy formula was completed the day before yesterday."
538724, "...Can I count on you?"
538725, "Certainly. "
538726, "Only if you drop the act and start telling me everything."
538727, "I have no interest in that... Inquisitor."
538728, "Wonderful. Let everyone do what they are best suited for. Mysticism is for the mystics, the depths of the earth and their relics-for the true believers, and intellectual paradoxes-for the intellectuals. The Abattoir will reveal itself to Burakh... while that strange tower, I believe, will reveal itself only to you."
538729, "That's what I'm hoping for as well. I was just going to discuss this with Victor Kain."
538730, "My impression was quite different... for now, at least."
538731, "You'll manage just fine without my assistance. I won't feel slighted."
538732, "I see that you don't trust me after what happened yesterday. Removing me from the frontlines, are you?"
538733, "I wish I could start this letter on a happier note, Bachelor, but I am utterly crestfallen./n/nThere is hardly a more harrowing discovery than to look back on the life you have lived and to see how little you have managed to do. I am almost out of time and the only thing I want is to pass whatever it was that gave meaning to my existence on to somebody else. Unsurprisingly, I see no better man to confide in than yourself. Please come to see me when you can./n/nP. S. I hope that the Tower will open up before you. It is very important. "
538734, "Victor's Invitation"
538735, "Will you look at him-ain't he tall, ain't he vested in emergency powers..."
538736, "I haven't come here to talk. Know what I mean? "
538754, "Don't bite the hand that feeds you, Grief... It won't end well."
538755, "And I think I know how to find one..."
538756, "I've only been there four times in my life; the only way in for me has always been through the Termitary. Every morning a crowd of workmen comes out of it, walks between the buildings and is swallowed up by the Abattoir's main entrance-the one they call the Gorge. Tycheek would always open and close it himself. But now he's dead, and you're out of luck."
538757, "Yes, I'm aware of that."
538758, "That's fine; it's not like his place at the Termitary's been left vacant, right? And now I'm even more interested in seeing the horrific results of your actions..."
538759, "The road into the Abattoir will have to pass through the Termitary. Superintendent Tychick is dead, and the overal state of affairs is best described as 'absolute anarchy'. Nevertheless, I am certain that someone will have to accept the burden of authority sooner or later. Whoever it will be, he will allow me passage into the bowels of the earth."
538760, "Serves you right."
538761, "I'll check on the situation. I was meaning to anyway... They're waiting for me there."
538762, "Moron. Be on your way."
538763, "You can't make me not go. So I will!"
538764, "The first person he discusses the situation with is going to be me. So believe me, I'll make sure he won't even let you to his quarters."
538765, "I will determine how the situation unfolds, not you."
538766, "I'm keeping an eye on you anyway! You are still a very suspicious person..."
538767, "Like I have nothing better to do than search your blood for fancy diseases!"
538768, "Really, it's all because I'm an outsider. Suspicions follow me everywhere! And pray tell, what's so wrong about me? Anyway, that was a relief. Allow me to thank you with a very special kiss..."
538769, "Go ahead."
538770, "Are you by any chance reciting some monologue? It's hard to believe the Saburovs are capable of such fervent scenes. "
538771, "They very much are. Katerina has only just turned thirty. As for fervency... she has quite an exquisite temper, just so you know. Morphine in her head and passion in her blood, oh, she's capable of many things. A demonic woman. "
538772, "And that brings us smoothly to the most pressing matter. I need a sample of your blood. "
538773, "I'm waiting. "
538774, "Here. Take it. I have nothing to be afraid of. I just don't like the sight of blood, is all... Ouch! Does it have to be so painful? Why are you taking so much...? I'm going to faint... You're trying to kill me, you butcher... But I'm not guilty!"
538775, "How about I shoot you, you mezzo-soprano, huh...? It's not like there'll be anyone to mourn the loss! And you know me-if something is required for the job to be done..."
538776, "Where is the Changeling?"
538777, "Ummm... Who knows, right? Ask the Saburovs. They're probably still crying their eyes out for their miraculously acquired little baby daughter! No, children are the root of all evil in this world, let me tell you..."
538778, "And now I need a sample of your blood. "
538779, "I'll ask them."
538780, "What? I haven't squeezed out even an ounce yet. "
538781, "I think she's having a fit..."
538783, "This isn't Lara."
538784, "This isn't Yulia."
538785, "Surprisingly... this isn't Aspity either."
538786, "This isn't Anna."
538787, "Yet somehow she knew to found The House of the Living in advance... Somehow she stocked up on water in advance, if only for a few people... Somehow she avoided having an isolation ward in her very house... So many coincidences, wouldn't you agree? But oh how naïve she looks, how tender the voice, how inviting the little vein on the neck..."
538788, "That can't be..."
538789, "Indeed... but it doesn't prove anything yet!"
538790, ""
538795, "No one is allowed inside the Tower. Khan's orders. You'll lead soldiers to us!"
538796, "I have a message from the Inquisitor to Khan. "
538805, "I'm a doctor, not a soldier. And there are no soldiers with me. "
538806, "Where?"
538807, "I'm investigating that right now. None survived. And the warehouse thieves have grown even fiercer, even though they managed to fight us off."
538808, "What does that mean? Are you intending to die? "
538809, "We are back at the starting point now. We deal with the issue of death differently. When the original identity is extinguished and an entirely new one arises in its place-is that death? Is madness not a form of death? Is loss of memory not the true death?"
538810, "That's just philosophy... Surely you didn't summon me here for that!"
538811, "Indeed. You see, I'm out of means to influence my son. Now that the town is occupied by soldiers, he is going to turn the Polyhedron into a fortress under siege, which will infuriate the army. I fear that his ill-advised actions may result in the Tower's destruction."
538812, "Why?"
538813, "There is a fourth Kain. What's to become of him?"
538814, "Are you about to lose your mind or your memory? And letting me know in advance just like that?"
538815, "You're joking... But I am completely serious. What I'm trying to say is precisely that we could involuntarily enter a strange state in which we all would, in a manner of speaking, lose ourselves... A slumber, from which we will not awaken for a long time. Who would take care of our affairs then?"
538816, "You would entrust them to me?"
538817, "Yes, very much so. Would you be willing to watch over... no, not over us, but over the garden which we have spent all our lives growing? There are many sharp axes around which would hack it away into oblivion."
538818, "Yes, I would. But only until my business here is finished."
538819, "No, I would not. I don't want that kind of responsibility."
538820, "Thank you. Now allow me please to lay out my first request."
538821, "You have my attention. I imagine your request has something to do with the Tower?"
538822, "How can it be prevented?"
538823, "I agree. What would you do if your words could influence Kaspar?"
538825, "So you're getting ready to die?"
538826, "Because for the first time in many years our town has drawn the attention of the Powers That Be. They are going to enforce their idea of order here. The Inquisitor is just the first of many things to come."
538827, "She's a special Inquisitor. She is here because of unusual circumstances which you are aware of."
538828, "Let's get back to the Polyhedron. I interrupted you with my question."
538829, "There's nothing to negotiate. I want to see it, not listen to some stories-I've done enough listening already."
538830, "Exactly. The enemy, on the other hand, had fourteen thousand casualties, if I recall correctly."
538831, "What is it?"
538832, "These rifles will not fire a single shot until the soldiers step onto these stairs. Promise?"
538833, "Yes. I promise. It's a fair condition. Now show me my rifles. "
538834, "Will you be able to keep your followers in check? Will they withstand the temptation?"
538835, "Khan... what was that?"
538836, "What did you see?"
538837, "I didn't understand a thing."
538838, "What is it made of? Is it cardboard?"
538839, "The magic lantern."
538840, "Wow... That is actually a lot! Were you taught how to do this?"
538841, "No.  "
538842, "So you didn't seen the mirrors?"
538843, "Did you even see a single facet? Did you see the events unfolding behind it? The contents are written on them. Sometimes we even write down our dreams on the facets."
538844, "No wonder."
538845, "Where is the thousand of children?"
538846, "I've only seen a well and some stairs. "
538847, "No. Still, where are all the tower-dwellers?"
538848, "What do you mean, where? Behind the facets. In each other's daydreams and night dreams, oftentimes shared. Only those who have been pushed out wander the stairs."
538849, "Where is the thousand of children?"
538850, "Pushed out?"
538851, "Some dreams threaten death and danger. If a child dies, they're pushed out onto the stairs. They can return in later, but it usually takes them a while to recover... And, well, some of them do return to the stairs voluntarily-unable to withstand the emotional intensity."
538852, "Are you sure you're not pulling my leg?"
538853, "I see."
538854, "You're a grown-up. You will never be able to comprehend this. Adults see nothing inside. Why else would Peter Stamatin drink himself twyre-eyed? This is why. He's created the most magnificent sorcery there is, but even he cannot see it. Can you imagine the torture he has to endure?"
538855, "Thanks for the reminder! I'll have hi explain something to me..."
538856, "Yes. It's excruciating. Goodbye, Khan. Thank you for bringing me back my childhood, if only for a moment. I've already forgotten what it's like..."
538857, "I've been to the Tower, Inquisitor. "
538858, "I'm dying to hear your account. What is inside?"
538859, "A thousand children."
538860, "Mirrors, Inquisitor. "
538861, "Something... else. It seems to be at odds with any and all common sense."
538862, "Impossible! It's just a specular prism. A crazy chamber with dozens of mirrors and light sources reflecting each other to drive a person insane... Is this some kind of joke?"
538863, "Not at all."
538864, "Of course it's a joke. So you've been there too?"
538865, "You saw the mirrors too? Well, how was it? Has your sanity withstood that challenge without much difficulty?"
538866, "So you've been there too?"
538867, "Not quite, Bachelor... It must be a remarkably curious structure. A Focus, huh?"
538868, "So the Polyhedron is the Focus?"
538869, "Yes. That's what it is."
538870, "I believe it would make sense for us to talk about it tomorrow... If it is what I think it is, then it's outstandingly exciting. Come back tomorrow. Do you need anything? "
538871, "Yes, I'm almost completely broke. Getting into the Tower was a rather costly endeavour."
538872, "No, nothing. See you tomorrow, Inquisitor. "
538873, "And so?"
538874, "Even if that is so, it doesn't oblige me to anything. Hopefully, this won't sour my relationship with you."
538876, "What happened to them, by the way?"
538877, "I don't know if something has happened... but something could happen any time now. They're a remarkable lot, you know... that have some remarkable family rites. They have this tradition for, I think, commemorating the dead, when they shut themselves in and refuse to allow absolutely anyone to communicate with them."
538878, "So it would be reasonable to speak with them about the Tower before they... set about their family tradition?"
538879, "Basically, yes. If you're too late, communication could become quite difficult. That I know from experience. Although I doubt that they will tell us what we really want to know about the Tower. Just speaking with them is not enough. I need documents."
538880, "Are they absolutely necessary?"
538881, "I understand."
538882, "Sorry, the thought has slipped my mind."
538883, "I completely agree with you. I can't wait for learn more myself."
538885, "You think so? "
538886, "I believe so. In any case, I'll speak with the Kains."
538887, "How about some water?"
538893, "Five? Why do you need that many?"
538894, "I'm not planning to drink them. I need them for self-immolation. Go, go, I'll wait for you. Burning twyrineless is frightening-its vapours would exalt me to subtle planes; I'd be a mere pile of ash falling to the ground otherwise. I'd just 'feed the earth,' as the Steppe people say... it'd gag anyway."
538896, "Oh, damn you to hell... Just don't do anything stupid. I'll have another word with you later."
538897, "Don't worry about the designs. They'll be in good hands."
538898, "I do care. Soon I'll prove that to you in practice."
538899, "...What happens to them afterwards? If I do convert them?"
538900, "The evil will not touch them. You will see it for yourself. They will become invulnerable to the scythe that will cut down the brazen, the blind, and the bellicose. Save them."
538901, "All right."
538902, "Do tell me more!"
538903, "Speak on!"
538904, "Go on, go on..."
538905, "No mother would hit her child so hard as to kill it..."
538906, "Why, the town will live... Who is to live in it, the Earth cares not, even if we do. The mother is not concerned with the germs in her child's body... until they make it ill. There are beneficial and harmful germs. When the child is ill, the mother gives it medicine to drink, in order to purge the harmful ones."
538907, "Now I understand..."
538908, "So be it. What am I to do now?"
538909, "You shall begin with Grace, the late cemetery caretaker's daughter. She is especially dear to me."
538910, "One shouldn't strive to be liked by those one wants to turn to the truth."
538911, "What of it? Isn't it better this way?"
538912, "Well! I see that the latest news have been too much of a shock to you. You're looking upset and bewildered. What a strange look you have in your eyes, girl... You ought to go to sleep, get some rest immediately. But Clara, are you really so easy to lead astray? This is the song of evil!"
538913, "...And who was this Willow?"
538914, "...She was nice, a real baby doll... But I did to her the same thing the Caravan had been doing to children: ground her into flour, unwove her into threads; I don't even know how I did it..."
538915, "Flour and threads? You're mad, aren't you?"
538917, "Yes, now I see that you're mad. You deserve to be exterminated."
538918, "Well, speak now!"
538919, "Simon is alive. Fully alive, do you understand? Eva's told me secretly!"
538920, "How can she know?"
538921, "The Bachelor has Eva completely under his thumb! She's like a slave to him now-but she also knows his secrets. And guess what-he's colluded with Stakh Rubin, an apprentice of Isidor's, a surgeon and former mercenary. Together, they're now hiding Simon from the Kains! Making it look like he's dead..."
538922, "Ah... I love secrets of every kind!"
538923, "Why are you telling me this?"
538924, "You need to check if Eva's telling the truth... do check! And afterwards, inform the Kains about that newcome Bachelor! Do you understand how that will change your life? They'll stop persecuting you! You'll gain their favours and earn a lot of money... Or perhaps you don't care about money at all?"
538925, "I'm very scared of this Bachelor... I feel that he's a demon, a spirit of destruction and downfall!"
538926, "And so-he killed the boy?"
538927, "He said, 'I'll do the job; I like it a lot when business gets bloody.' 'I'll find that scoundrel of yours,' he said, 'and if I see that he deserves death, I'll cut him into little pieces right on the spot...' And I don't know what possessed me to agree, but I did."
538928, "And you're regretting it now? There, there... How did it come about at all that such words escaped your lips?"
538929, "I don't know what to do with myself now... If I could only bring him back, the scoundrel! Just to think that I gave someone the right to decide if he should live or die!"
538930, "That's true... who are we to ever have such a privilege?"
538931, "But perhaps he's left the traitor alive after all? Eh, I'm afraid not. Lika is not the type to make an impression of a creature deserving to live... And they say some young lad's been killed by the Station; the description matches."
538932, "Don't cry! Be firm. Someone had to decide this."
538934, "Yes. That's how it usually happens... with people of the kind."
538935, "Don't despair. The Haruspex has spared him; I know that for certain."
538936, "It's good that you're filled with regret. You'll soon find that repentance is beneficial."
538937, "So that's who it was... This Lika, he's dead now. I'm sorry to pain you, but I know that for sure."
538939, "How do you know?"
538940, "I was the one who decided if he should live or die."
538941, "His death was inevitable. Higher powers killed him, not you. He wasn't a boy at all, but a real monster. So don't blame yourself."
538942, "I just do."
538943, "Where are you, my girl? We didn't finish our conversation yet. Come back to us. The streets are too dangerous a place for you to stay... Besides, was it not fate that led you, unmistakably, to our home? Why, then, are you so intent on rejecting our hospitality?/n/nWaiting for you, implacably,/nKaterina"
538944, "Katerina is Worried"
538945, "...sister of mine, who can trickle through a tiniest crack, crawl through a barely visible hole, it is almost as though you could seep through the pores in human skin. It is as if you were not a human being, but a nectar-sweet moisture of volatile spirit! How is this even possible?/n/nPeople trust you; that's how./n/nHave no fear. Go where you will-and nothing will touch you. Speak your mind-and no one will reject you. Hear them out-and nothing will evade your attention./n/nThere is but one question I want to ask-what is it that you do to make people love me less and less, trust me less and less, even when I am asleep?/n/nWhatever you answer me, remember I love you more than anything and will never be angry with you./n/nHere I am, take my hand..."
538946, "You are the only one who can do it..."
538947, "...since they call you both names? Whether or not you're a saint is not for you to judge, but can you at least remember what it was that you stole? Why do they try to chase you, to hunt you down, as if you were the world's worst offender?/n/nSister of mine, don't you cry. Don't give in to despair. As powerful as your enemies are, your protectors wield greater power. /n/nA villain should be judged. A saint should perform miracles. If you cannot spare time for these everyday commitments, rest assured I will take care of your affairs for you!/n/nI am going to visit the Skinners district today./n/nDo you recognise my hand yet?"
538948, "Are you a saint or a thief..."
538949, "She wants to do a good deed, so she makes a shelter for the living, where people who want none of your miracles may hide. Furtively, out of control, she collects the money she then spends on provisions. She is an angel, they say. And no one, not  a single person would call her a thief.../n/nCould it be that she won't welcome you in her shelter? Would she refuse sharing the burden of righteousness with you? The time has come to knock on her door..."
538950, "Do you know what Lara has in mind?"
538953, "Daughter (for this is how we want to call you from now on)!/n/nI am brought down by a heavy burden: Katerina is sick and she won't be able to perform the tasks of a Mistress without your help./n/nMuch labour awaits you. We will let you run free, but be prepared that every single day, either me or my wife will have an errand for you. Be at hand./n/nWith great expectations,/nYour loving father"
538954, "Alexander is Waiting"
538955, "...that's how they name anyone who is hiding from the law. This is our worst enemy, the Law, as merciless, cruel, and unrighteous as it is. The Law thinks nothing of whatever falls between the arms of its scale. The Law does not believe in anything that falls inbetween the black and the white./n/nThe Law is impossible to appease. Its motion is heavy and devastating. For the time being you have escaped its all-seeing eye. You were thinking, perhaps, that it won't find you here? That's how it was, for a long time./n/nAs of today, however, everything has changed. Were my traces uncovered? Is my miraculous power not enough to hide myself?"
538956, "I know why they call me a thief..."
538957, "There is a creature that wants to have a word with you. They call it a shabnak and think it is the maneater itself, although I don't find it all that scary... Perhaps, there is some mistake./n/nIt wants to talk to you./n/nYour friend Grace"
538958, "Grace's Note"
538959, "I know everything about you now. I know it was you who got inside the Catheral. I know you have left there the presents the other people gave you. I know that you are the very person whom the Bound see whenever the streets by their homes get infected with Sand Plague!/n/nYou are not going to escape. The only thing that may save you is giving yourself up to me of your own accord. I promise I will let you live, then, I will not surrender you to the crowd, but take you with me to the Capital instead. And there I will study you./n/nCome to me, my girl./n/nBachelor Dankovsky"
538960, "You are not going to escape!"
538961, "...before dawn. I was lying at the riverbank with my feet under the water. My arms were stretched out and there were handfuls of earth in my grasp./n/nI praised heaven for my salvation and then turned my thoughts to my beloved children, the ones entrusted to me. It is very difficult to reach them, however, so I have no other choice but to take care of the other Bound. I took some of them in my ward already so you need not worry on their behalf./n/nI placed my hands on the shoulders of my Bound ones and went after you. I've been searching for you all day long. Alas, you have slipped away today, as you always do. My wonderful hands did too much labour today, they won't serve me anymore... Everything will be just fine. I will see you soon enough, my dear."
538962, "The chill woke me up today..."
538963, "...make a visit to the Cathedral. They need me there, I feel, else the worst could happen... Where are you? What do you have on your mind? I've lost your trace once again./n/nI also cannot escape the feeling that the Bachelor and the Haruspex, the two merciless strangers whom nature itself would command to eliminate each other, have joined forces to destroy me instead. Where are you? I am so worried about you..."
538964, "By this evening I am going to..."
538965, "Oh, I do know what it's about! There's this local usurer... I'll tell you later how I'm involved here. So Tough Vlad decided to pocket his blood money. Vlad himself had had to pay up quite heftily. He transferred the funds to your new father yesterday."
538966, "But what does that have to do with you?"
538967, "We'll come to that, my dear. The Hunchback refused to give Vlad the money. So Vlad said he'd find a way to bring him to heel-pressure someone who could reveal all the skeletons in the Hunchback's closet. That was a direct hint at me! Vlad had found out about my involvement with the Hunchback."
538968, "But it's hardly something that Alexander wanted to find out..."
538969, "Please my dear, save me from those infernal Olgimskys! Vlad is terribly, unbelievably cruel; he can't control his anger. He can smash an oak table into splinters; he can condemn hundreds of people to torture just to quench his own fury! Help me, and I'll be completely open with you! Find out if Big Vlad is scheming against me!"
538970, "Would he really threaten you?"
538971, "That's just how it looks to you. I'm naturally pale-skinned."
538972, "Whoa, whoa... What are you getting at?"
538973, "Yes. He thinks I'm easy to handle because of how I acted yesterday... And today, there was this threatening message. Saying I'll soon die the same death as others who-well, no need to go into the vapid lies that follow. Signed, 'Look Back'. Do you have any idea how scary that is?"
538974, "How am I supposed to talk to him? He won't even let me past the door. My words can't pierce walls."
538975, "Well, think of something. You'll surely manage, I sense an angelic power in you! I, of course, would have used his children to get to him... but they're already grown-up and I wouldn't be able to handle them at this point. But you will!"
538977, "What kind of a strange signature is that?"
538978, "It's a hint that there'll always be danger lurking behind my back! I mean, what else could it be?"
538979, "So how can I help you there?"
538980, "Used his children... that sounded sinister."
538981, "See you later, Anna. I'll come back with news."
538982, "What? And this is what you've come to ask me about? That's absurd! Our family doesn't care about this Anna! Well, didn't, until yesterday... but that's about her possessions, not her person; possessions, I might add, that she'd obtained under very shady circumstances... And here's the result-she's making up imaginary enemies now."
538983, "Why is she so afraid of your father then? It can't be on account of the commandeering yesterday."
538984, "She's afraid of the smallest noise now-and no surprise. A life of fear is the price she 's paying for the horror she once helped unleash. You do know about the Caravan, don't you?"
538985, "No. I know nothing about the Caravan."
538986, "Say, you must be from far away indeed. A few years ago, the Ace of Diamonds Caravan was all that the entire country was talking about. That was a bunch of especially scary criminals who were committing savage and senseless atrocities while posing as a wandering circus. They were famous for kidnapping children."
538987, "Why did they do all that?"
538988, "Oh... So Anna was with the Caravan?"
538989, "Judging by what's been coming to light recently, yes. She was with the Caravan. And her role there was among the most loathsome: an enticing bait for the trusty children those trolls were intending to kidnap."
538990, "I have one more question: is it true that your dad has decided to appropriate a Stone Yard usurer's blood money?"
538991, "Enough! I'm not discussing my father's affairs, especially not with you, Changeling. You've barged into our lives way too quickly-as something in between a temptress and a judge. I find both equally dangerous, given that you're an alien. You're a force from out of our world."
538992, "Be careful... I'll be watching you!"
538993, "I'm no Earthdaughter. I'm of celestial extraction."
538994, "Whoa, look at you, you're some mess... Which of us is the earthdaughter?"
538995, "No. I'd rather not meet a monster like that. I need the newcome one, the outsider."
538996, "Are you pulling my leg? Look me in the eye, morlock! I'll step on your yurt if I have to; I could give you a whacking no worse than any haruspex... You know who I need."
538997, "Burakh. You're looking for Burakh. The son, not the father. Ay, he was here too."
538998, "Enough... I can't stand the stench anymore!"
538999, "And where is this den?"
539000, "On the bank of the Gullet. It's easy to find. You'll have to take the steps down to get there. It's under the ground, ay, close to Suok..."
539001, "Goodbye, morlock."
539004, "There is more than one haruspex here, more than one man that knows. Which of them do you need? The biggest and the most dangerous is Foreman Oyun. He came here two days ago, trampled our fires and yurts. We would have died under his hooves, had we not hidden ourselves... "
539005, "No, I've no desire to meet a monster like that. I need a stranger, one of the outsiders."
539006, "It is Burakh, you need Burakh. Not old, the young one. Yes, he came here. "
539007, "Did he bring his herb formulas?"
539008, "He did. I didn't take them. He took them to the dealers, took to sell to the dealers. "
539009, "Who are these dealers? "
539010, "Herb dealers are all in the den. A cruel man reigns there, an artist, a builder, the one that also came from the other end of the Steppe-the end where only the dressed up dead and Suok spawn dwell... He makes twyre tinctures here, he blasphemes, he abuses the herb!"
539011, "And how does he blaspheme against it? "
539012, "He treats herbs badly, he tries their patience... Gives more money for them than we do. He set us against each other, made us kill those who'd given him the secret spices... If you ever find herbs, don't give them to him, he'll hurt them."
539013, "Want me to sell them to you?"
539014, "No business shall we have with you, for you smell of clay! Don't you ever come back here, for you smell of rich clotted clay..."
539015, "You freak! "
539016, "Eww... Gross."
539017, "So Burakh took herbs to him? That's what I wanted to know."
539018, "And where is this den? "
539019, "On the Gullet bank. Easy to find. Go down to enter. Underground he is, yes, close to Suok..."
539021, "Enough... I can't stand this stench anymore! "
539022, "Are you messing with me? Look me in the eye, morlock! I can't trample your yurt, but I'll take you out just as efficiently as any haruspex would... You know full well who I'm talking about."
539023, "Oh, but I'm no Earthdaughter! I am of heavenly nature."
539024, "Oh my, what a monster you are... Which of us is an Earthdaughter, I wonder?"
539025, "Say one more word, and I'll turn your blood into clotty gruel! "
539026, "I don't need herbs anyway. I only eat meat. "
539027, "Peter Stamatin"
539028, "Anna Angel's take on him:/n'While it's common consensus that both of them are brilliant, you don't need to be the brightest tool in the shed to see that Peter is the real genius. Such people are only born once a century. Not that I deny Andrey his talent... But Peter has drowned his gift in twyrine long ago, and it's become glaringly obvious that Andrey is nothing without him. Now Andrey believes that it is his duty to protect Peter and serve as a middleman between the harsh reality and the drunkard brother!'"
539029, "Ah, pray tell! What are they up to?"
539030, "They're not the ones plotting against you; it's the Kains. Anyway, they've both been distracted now. Got themselves a bogeyman that's scarier than you..."
539031, "You have nothing to worry about, sweet dear... The Olgimskys aren't interested in you in the slightest. A boy named Khan is who's sending you the threats... I wonder why?"
539033, "I wonder if Simon himself is part of that plot..."
539034, "Yes, I think so... There must be a reason the three of them are doing this! And their goals are probably evil. What else could they be..."
539035, "Ah, what you are saying! Do you think they're up to something bad?"
539036, "I do. And why didn't you-"
539037, "...Let's begin then. Anna, did you cause this plague?"
539038, "Anna, is it true that you are a kidnapper of children-a criminal from the Caravan?"
539039, "...I'm afraid I did... Afraid I'm guilty... For we will never be forgiven... we will be exterminated, all of us, with no clemency. No one will be saved."
539040, "...It's not true! I've never kidnapped a child. I was myself kidnapped at a very young age. Well, not literally kidnapped... My ending up there was more of a mishap..."
539041, "Why didn't it?"
539044, "But how did you do it?"
539045, "...It's all because I'm cursed. Because I've finally become one of them-one of the Caravan!"
539046, "Why, then, do people say that you're a performer from the Caravan?"
539047, "...Because they wanted to make me one of their lot... Tried to make a singer out of me. Dressed me up in motley-patterned stockings and a whalebone corset... so that children would come to look at me and listen to my frolicky songs... But it didn't work."
539048, "A mishap? Why?"

539053, "...They had sorcery in their blood. They made stage artistes out of children like myself... Nothing came out of my singing in the end, but I did become a true Caravan girl!

But if she is allowed to stay, the disease will remain as well."

However, some of the townsfolk still take her for a saint instead of villain. These places where people are still devoted to her are where I must search."

539133, "...The moment his boots stepped on the dusty soil of our roads, the moment he took a deep breath of our air, the moment his shadow fell on the cobbles of our town, I knew that my life had changed, and that it was approaching its acme. He has come, and now I live for his sake..."
539134, "...Why do you love him so much?"
539136, "Doomed? I don't understand what you're saying at all... What does being able to work miracles have to do with anything? No, miracle-workers aren't doomed! Even those of them whose lives are short live them to the fullest in a way you couldn't live a thousand ordinary lives! "
539137, "Look at me, Eva. I can work miracles. I can sense their nature. Mark my words: neither you nor he will get any miracles for as long as you're expecting them with such greed and entitlement!"
539138, "Why? No, Clara, you didn't see what we saw. You're being too serious. Those who watched Scarlet Nina build the town, who watched Simon play with our children, would never say it's futile to demand a miracle... One can, and in a way, one must!"
539139, "Believe me, it's because of teachings like these that the disease has struck your town. For as long as the town is afire with this naïve, criminal, and greedy hope, you will go on suffering and dying. I know it. I am the harbinger."
539140, "Is it that great? Not really. He longs for miracles; he needs living evidence of the impossible... Yet was this not what I used to brood on daily and nightly? Was this not the reason I shed so many tears over our useless Cathedral?"
539141, "Look at me, Eva. I can work miracles. I can sense their nature. Mark my words: neither you nor he will get any miracles for as long as you're expecting them with such greed and entitlement!"
539142, "He is not like you. He's a cold-hearted demon."
539143, "What's wrong with your Cathedral?"
539144, "You're asking me? You, who are called a saint, whose tender heart ought to know the answers to such questions? Why, you're just testing me... I'll tell you. Look at the place where true miracles are meant to be happening: it's empty and dead like the shell of a bad nut."
539145, "I'll tell you why."
539146, "Are you hoping that it will come back to life?"
539147, "Of course I am! And you know, I feel that it's going to come back to life any day now-now that you've all come here! You, the girl with miraculous hands, are here for a reason too! I'm sure that the Cathedral will spring back to life very soon-for his sake. And I will help..."
539148, "No, Eva. It's not going to happen while you think about it like that."
539149, "Well... Go on hoping then. Perhaps it will be just like you say."
539150, "Well well... So that's what the utopian false doctrine looks like. Why, it sure is beautiful."
539151, "Did you call my words a false doctrine?"
539152, "All right. I won't try to dissuade you, Eva. Go on living for the sake of your love..."
539153, "That's precisely why you've gathered here, you miracle hunters... That is why your Bachelor is here: to meet his death-for it was people like you who that incurred the wrath of heaven. I am the harbinger of this truth. Reconsider before it's too late."
539154, "I can."
539155, "I will take care of him."
539156, "He says we have to fight... To hope for the impossible until the very end."
539157, "He's the one who'll do the fighting. Not you, gentle Eva... Sleep."
539158, "How can you tell? I, for one, know it's not true..."
539159, "No. I haven't seen him."
539160, "You probably didn't look hard enough! He's bound to be hiding here somewhere!"
539161, "I've searched every room in every house; I listened to the banging of doors inside, I would even light my lamp, and now the wick is all gone. There was no one in here!"
539162, "Oh great. So I've wasted several precious hours because of that bloody sod. And I still haven't obtained any dead tissue..."
539163, "Mark my words, it won't be two days before you thank heavens for letting the Ripper escape your wrath today..."
539164, "Take heart. Dead tissue will soon be in no short supply. Enough for you and for everyone walking these streets."
539165, "Aren't you afraid that he'll overpower you? He looks menacing..."
539166, "Not afraid at all. I'm well armed."
539167, "He's armed even better... We'll see who wins."
539168, "I have. Don't try to scare me. Men armed with pistols, scalpels, and kitbags are more dangerous than infected clouds!"
539169, "Eva?"
539170, "No. Capella. Aren't you here on her request?"
539171, "Yes, precisely, Eva. She's cried her grey eyes out... Go to her, will you?"
539172, "You're the one doing the errands, not me. I'm doing my own work here. Actually, that reminds me: have you by any chance seen a dodgy-looking lad around? I told him to get lost but now I'm not sure he listened. You could tell by his eyes he was a weaselly fellow."
539173, "No, Bachelor... You're the only weaselly fellow here that I'm aware of."
539174, "I wonder what you were up to while he was out there risking his little life. I've sent him away."
539175, "That's intense... So what happens now?"
539176, "I've been trying to track him down for some time now. He's certainly somewhere close. Flashed past a while ago, actually. If you happen to see him, tell me which house he's in. I'll deliver on rewards. In coin as well as medicine. They will come in handy."
539177, "Whose body did he snatch?"
539178, "Now that's something you don't need to know. But it very likely was the exact body that I need."
539179, "And what if that child Loafer were to encounter him? Have you thought about that?"
539180, "That makes you the body-snatcher! And certainly no better than him!"
539181, "What you're talking about is utterly beyond me."
539182, "I'm not angry with you. I think I know what this is about..."
539183, "...Really? Do you really want to do something nice for me? I don't even know what to say... You know, sometimes I feel that there is no one better and kinder than you in the whole world, and that whatever you might do would be good, even for me..."
539184, "But sometimes you feel differently, don't you?"
539185, "Yes... Yes, sometimes I feel as though you and I were enemies. And you are a very dangerous enemy-seeing as you're not human... Ah, what am I saying. Got a headache, sorry... It's all this terrible air."

539384, "My house is too small... and also, you know, it used to be my father's.

539520, "Three flamethrower-wielding freaks. And an officer."
539521, "Life doesn't teach you anything... What you are going to do? "
539522, "I see... I see. What can I say? Well done, Andrey Stamatin... you heartless bastard! Why did you leave him alone?"
539523, "What's wrong with you? I'll just deal with everything that needs to be dealt with-and that's it, I'm never leaving him again. All our lives we've been persecuted for being extraordinary! As soon as a genuis sets foot out of his house, he's immediately struck by lightning! You must know that-we're birds of feather, you and us..."
539524, "Yes. This is true... I could have easily been in your shoes. "
539525, "No, Andrey, we are not birds of feather... you're absolutely mental!"
539527, "What's up with Peter, Andrey? Where is he? "
539530, "I'm listening. "
539531, "At last I realized that any building is an edifice. A concurrence of planes, lines, rhythms, and temperatures that can become a perfect vessel for a soul. Not a human soul, no; a bigger one! The soul that no man can communicate with yet, for it has no shape, cycle, or voice..."
539532, "Are you referring to an intelligent being?"
539533, "I don't know. Neither did I know or experience this soul back then-I only sensed its existence and loved it in advance. When my passion reached its zenith, I realized I just couldn't live like that any longer. I wanted to speak its tongue, I wanted to touch it!"
539534, "Go on, go on..."
539535, "And so I gradually began to try. I started to design buildings that were not buildings; chambers that people couldn't live in-everyone thought I was either a madman or a joke... Only my brother believed in me. He and the few that were privy to my secret. They knew that my designs were not intended for men, but rather for this wondrous soul..."
539536, "And what came out of that? "
539537, "Finally I understood that I was on the right track! I knew I've discovered an insane but genuine feature that only a lover can feel-and I knew I was striking true! I constructed project after project, but... all of them contravened the laws of earthly physics and geometry. Seems like my beloved soul was unlikely to find a permanent shelter on this earth... "
539538, "Why? "
539539, "Chimeras, they were all chimeras... Nobody would have allowed me to even model them... if not for Nina the Wild! Oh, that's when my brother and I met her! She married Victor, went to live here and provided me with everything-the place, the materials, the working hands, and-most importantly-the hearts willing to believe in miracles."
539540, "What do you mean?"
539541, "I mean that buildings demand people. Moreover, they demand the people that would demand those buildings back! Museum showpieces, models, abstractions, mind games-these are all not my cups of twyrine. Nina gave me a whole living town-a town aching and craving to go heavenwards, to the stars-a town desperately hungering for a crown-the crown I've given to it!"
539546, "It's hot, Peter... The story is going to take a while, why don't you come over here?"
539547, "Was it that beautiful?"
539548, "Peter, this heat is intolerable. How can you stand it? "
539549, "And how could I stand that which was burning me from the inside all these years? No, no; you're a medical man, a cynical man, a geometrician, you're not a poet-you'll never understand. You cannot see the profound. You fear death!"
539550, "Well, no, I don't... But go on."
539551, "And you don't? On the other hand, obsession does indeed eliminate fear."
539552, "The eternal curse of dreamers like you and I... "
539553, "So what can your Polyhedron really do?"
539554, "I cannot put it into words. It's only been tested by the children yet. If you asked them, they'd tell you that it brings their dreams to life, plays their games, daydreams with them, transports them into someone else's fantasies. Heard anything about it?"
539555, "I have."
539556, "But the Kains could tell you even more! They'd tell you this is a vessel that can hold the most precious substance of all-the focus of a soul... But even they cannot understand what they've been granted. Neither can I. And I will never be able to repeat it... I'm dead..."
539557, "Well, now I've heard it-from you."
539558, "So this is suicide? "
539559, "Maria asked me to tell you something."
539563, "...She did? What? "
539564, "She will become a Mistress and construct your latest invention. She gave me her word. "
539565, "Take it, Peter. Die if you really want to. "
539568, "I have."
539569, "You are delirious... "
539570, "You will find the answer one day, Peter. "
539571, "I am Bachelor Dankovsky, an authorized representative of the Inquisitor, head of the sanitary staff. Your company commander should have informed you."
539572, "Right. So what are you here for?"
539573, "No, you'll be the one to answer my questions, not the other way around. On what authority are you here? Answer-unless you fancy a court martial, that is."
539574, "Are you trying to order me around, you civvie rat? Got yourself a death wish?"
539575, "No. I don't."
539576, "Name and number of your unit. Now!"
539577, "No, nothing. "
539578, "This is your final warning. Any further attempt to engage in conversation with me will be your last one."
539579, "You will regret this... You're nothing but mutineers and looters, not soldiers on duty!"
539580, "I'll keep that in mind."
539581, "I am on duty as well. I want to hear a full report. Now."
539582, "Why in the world would I do that? "
539583, "We're going to find the offender sooner or later anyway... We already have tactical data suggesting that one of the offenders is hiding in the ruined building in the central part of the town and is presenting armed resistence. I suggest you cooperate in his arrest. Or else."
539584, "He'll come back here soon. Wait and he'll be here."
539585, "Is that so... "
539586, "I've built it from prisms and mirrors! I've managed to focus them, to capture the perfect trick of the light and dream... That's right! I'm a trickmaster, the ultimate magician! I've focussed the aura of magic just like a lens focusses sunrays! And now the town is dying... poisoning my precious wreath, my crystal bud, my Focus..."
539587, "I think so too..."
539588, "Great. Perhaps you should even become friends."
539589, "I'm afraid of him... He'll chase me away."
539590, "That means you're guarding your lady poorly!"
539591, "I've brought these... offerings to her. "
539592, "She must receive them personally from the hands of the other two. It's strange that she has entrusted you with this affair."
539593, "Give them to your lady. The sooner, the better. "
539594, "Impossible. We shouldn't touch them. The lady will be distressed-or even angry. If you cannot find her anywhere, just leave the offerings at the tomb of Nina the Scarlet. No one will touch them there, and it would be best for the House."
539596, "Nothing strange about it. I will not fail her confidence and trust."
539597, "You were simply focussing your sight on a single point for too long, mate. You should not forget to look around."
539598, "Let me see Maria. "
539599, "It is impossible. The lady is sleeping. She cannot be disturbed now, however important an occasion. Only the lady's maids are allowed inside-they are tending to her body."
539600, "And I happen to share her opinion on the matter. "
539601, "Is Grief to blame for starting this plague?"
539602, "Mark said that there's some sort of Rat Prophet living in the basement of the town's Theatre, some lying spirit who has taken over Katerina."
539603, "Wait, are you crying? "
539604, "Was he arrested? "
539605, "No, he was not arrested. They came in, pointed the guns at him, grabbed him by the arms, and took him away... The neighbours told us to come here because all the soldiers get their orders here. We came in, but he's not here-never was..."
539606, "Where could he have been taken? "
539608, "No thank you, pumpkin. Leave it to yourself. "
539609, "This is exactly what 'arrested' means. They must have had a reason. Go home."
539610, "Where could they have been taken to? "
539611, "I have no idea. We tried to interrogate the children, but they only sob and refuse to utter a single distinct word! "
539612, "...It's just 'both', no 'the'. But it doesn't matter now. Where did they take them? "
539613, "He was taken to the courtyard, and there the soldiers gathered the men from our entire street! They asked them if they're going to help them arrange a provocation. And Daddy said that they wouldn't! Then the main one, the guy with iron teeth, said, 'To the cemetery-quick-march!' And they took them there... That's all I know!"
539614, "There will be a chance. As for now, go home immediately!"
539615, "You just didn't get a chance to check it for sure, you blockhead! Oh you blockheads..."
539616, "It's nothing. "
539617, "They don't. The news of your execution was a surprise for the general. "
539618, "Why did they do this to you?"
539619, "As far as I understand, one division here wants to attack another. They needed us for a provocation or something. Said they're going to seize the weapon."
539620, "Curious..."
539621, "No, way more. Twenty or so. Only four of us are left... And if not for you, there would have been none."
539622, "So it has begun. The army is out of control... "
539623, "Peter! Where's your brother Andrey? "
539625, "I hope you're not suggesting that she had eliminated her seniors to grab power?"
539626, "I thought after yesterday's incident he'll cling to you like a limpet. Yet here you are-all alone once again."
539627, "'Sister'"
539628, "My precious albino, this peculiar alter ego of mine, was expelled from the Town! This effigy of my indecision, crafted out of someone else's keepsakes, has gone away; just as it should have done. It walks towards the Steppe now, moving through the Rotten Field. I will be able to get ahold of him if I come by the hanging sacks at three hours before midnight."
539629, "*** Oh no, I am not going to the Prophet. I am quite happy with what he said of me already... and with what he revealed of my sister, if she exists."
539630, "How did you get home after what happened yesterday? "
539631, "So this is how pirate treasures come to be... "
539632, "Here are the signs of acknowledgement from Clara and Capella. They send their regards to you, Dark Mistress. "
539633, "Precisely. This is what differentiates a utopia from a dream. There is a 'top' in 'utopia', but don't let the word deceive you: it's all about what's down below. It requires dirt. A ruby firmament needs something to sit atop-otherwise it'd topple. A utopia can appreciate the earthly and the humane in their raw homeliness. That is why we have the blood-stained Abattoir, the Rotten Field, the dens, and Earth-the collective name of the poorer districts-itself."
539634, "Is that so... "
539635, "A utopia needs the Cult of Bulls, a living echo of the time when the human and the bestial world sung in unison. Beastliness lies at the heart of our civilization. Dirt, blood, manure, devourment, skins, meat, and bone tools. This is what the human civilization of creators originates from."
539636, "Architectural constructions seem to make passions run high. Some people demand the Abattoir to be razed, and others want to do the same to the Polyhedron. It's like they're living creatures."
539637, "They are living creatures, Daniil Dankovsky."
539638, "Poetry, even more poetry... "
539639, "Oh no, it isn't! Take the Abattoir-and old body, an organ petrified with age, the thing that the earth breathes through. A vociferous spirit inhabits it-a spirit devoid of history, memory, name, or kin. An ancient lifeforce that has in reality been long dead."
539640, "What do you mean?"
539641, "The light of the stars long extinguished still reaches us. The distance is so great that the light keeps penetrating space even though the star itself is long gone. It's the same with Earth. It's soaked with the humours of an ancient life-the life that gave birth to every thing in existence long before men came into being. The source is gone now, but the humours keep flowing, trying to reach the sun..."
539642, "What about the Polyhedron? "
539643, "The Polyhedron is a mirror that preserves the reflection of the person that has looked into it the last. You know, when Nina died, Maria said she may never be able to cope with grief... she started to pine away. That is when Focus was created."
539644, "By Peter? "
539645, "Yes. I don't know how he managed to do it. I think that's because he loved Nina so much. Anyway-he ended up creating a space she could inhabit. Can you imagine? You come into a room and can definitely feel that she's there-as if you've simply turned away from her for a second... And you can talk to her."
539646, "But what does it have to do with the Polyhedron?"
539647, "You still don't get it? Simon conceived the Polyhedron with a special purpose in mind. He never explained it to us. Children that have settled there were like little monkeys to him-he let them play there until it was time to use the Tower as intended."
539648, "What was its purpose? "
539649, "I think Simon has built it for himself. Exactly in case he..."
539650, "So it's a tomb... "
539651, "I don't care, old boy. I only know one thing for certain: everything can go down a hole-but the Tower must be kept intact."
539652, "Even if the Tower is destroyed now, nothing can be fixed anyway."
539653, "It should be kept intact-if only for the uniqueness of this pathologic phenomenon."
539654, "It needs to be rooted away immediately! And I will do it."
539655, "The Scarlet Mistress. But it matters not. So if a miracle happens-if those who must remain alive by my design are still alive by tomorrow; is the merciless Powers That Be disregard us, like they used to; then we will be able to contest the ruthless law of existence. The dream will prevail. There will be a new Utopia."
539656, "What is a utopia for you, Maria? "
539657, "It's not the Tower, en-Daniil. It's the whole town. A utopia is not the dream of mercantile prosperity, sensible social structure, or political fairness to us-it's the mystical manifestation of a world inscrutable and inaccessible for men."
539658, "Who am I speaking to? The mouth is yours, but neither the voice nor the choice of words is... "
539659, "Indeed. Keep listening. This world exists, but it cannot be touched. Ever. It can reveal itself obliquely, but inevitably dies under direct scrutiny. It has a built-in essential stealth mechanism that launches self-destruction when this world is trapped."
539660, "So Aglaya was right... "
539661, "Probably. But luckily for us, even the most well-adjusted mechanisms fail. And the two worlds do still touch sometimes! Antibodies collide! And then they go against the law of self-preservation, merging into a wondrous symbiosis rather than dying. This is the state of Utopia-an earthly form of an unearthly miracle!"
539662, "And so you have constructed this town? Is this what an embodied miracle looks like? "
539663, "Yes, we have. We could have create a mind-boggling place of rock crystal, sapphire walls, emerald roofs, and ruby pavements; a place akin to those you're used to seeing in children's fairy-tales about fairy countries. But this place is inhabited by people of flesh and blood. Why are you so surprised?"
539664, "Why the dirt and the pedestrianism? Why the disheveled walls, the rusty beams, the drain covers? Is this really what a utopia looks like?"
539665, "But how is it miraculous?"
539666, "Earth represents the miracle of the antropophobic Steppe merging with the human world. The Settlement represents the miracle of turning a society of devourers into a society of creators. The very logic of this town's existence is a miracle in and of itself. When the process of its creation has reached a peak, the Cathedral has been built. It's been a failure though..."
539667, "...And then the Polyhedron was created. "
539668, "Yes. The Tower on the Other Side has become the representation of the final metamorphosis, the miracle of merging the realm of possibilities with the realm of the impossible."
539669, "Why would anyone need a utopia? It's a chimera, nothing more."
539670, "Wait. Is this the reason for the plague?"
539672, "If it's all so perfect, why is there a plague?"
539673, "I do not know, en-Daniil... It's not our fault. The town could not bear this tension, this heat-oh well, we shall restart it then. There is no death. We do not fear it. See-dead and incorporeal, I am still present... a restless soul destined to come back eternally."
539674, "I've heard this recently... yes. This is the truth."
539675, "You shouldn't have merged the extremes. Couldn't you have looked for a compromise?"
539676, "Mother hated compromises. That's why it all worked for her. She could also view it all as a graceful chain-she has interlinked all those powers, making then serve one another."
539677, "How exactly?"
539678, "A failure you've failed to address..."
539679, "You are mistaken. The town has crawled from dirt and bestial selfishness towards the demand for a spiritual life; the demand for creation-pointless from the rational point of view. We have addressed this. The Cathedral was a failure exactly because it was merely a trade-off."
539680, "A trade-off? "
539681, "Yes. A convenient shape. Too human. Not real enough. A cathedral without God, without faith... No miracle can settle a building like this."
539682, "And so you have built another shrine... "
539683, "Mysticism, more mysticism... Theomachy. Could it have been the reason for everything that had happened? "
539684, "What? Was it the Changeling, the future Mistress of the Earth, that has offered you these words along with the relics? These are her words. 'Three miracles have begotten one another, but now the chain wants to circle back to a close. The disease has forged the final metamorphosis, turning the utopia into manure and bringing it back to the soil that everything has come from.'"
539685, "An infernal transmutation if I've ever seen any. Is this what the girl everyone considers to be a saint is preaching?"
539686, "A horrible, but fair metamorphosis. "
539687, "And which direction is right?"
539688, "None of them are, Bachelor Dankovsky! Do come to your senses! Let go of your pride! Let go of your victory and let me have mine! The town will stay, and nothing will have to perish! None of the three worlds will have to be sacrificed, neither beasts nor men nor children!"
539689, "Are you trying to convince me with shouting once again? I am not the person to be swayed by nervous exaltation! You may as well throw a fit-I still won't trust you."
539690, "I need to think. "
539691, "Are you sure? "
539692, "Well, it's for the better... A new colourful star is rising in our skies-for the first time in many years. All hail its ascent..."
539693, "You're... happy? I thought Maria and you were rivals. "
539694, "You sound sad."
539695, "Look, this is simply insulting! Would I be worthy of being called a Mistress-in the future, if not right now-if I put my pride and my personal interests above the needs of a dying town? A Mistress will bring our town back to life, so her coming is a blessing."
539696, "But this town won't be in tune with your design. At all."
539697, "How would you change the town? "
539698, "Oh, I have grand desings... I would change it completely. You know... It's scarlet now, scarlet and navy and taupe... I would make it golden and chalk and cinammon and chestnut. We'd have new powers, new ideas, new aspirations... it would be completely different."
539699, "Would it be better?"
539700, "Seems like you're beginning to daydream too..."
539701, "Sounds interesting... and very beautiful. So what do you need to win and rebuild the town according to your design?"
539702, "...Are you serious? "
539703, "No, of course not. I was just trying to be nice."
539704, "Yes. Dead serious. "
539705, "Then trust Artemy Burakh. Take him to the Cathedral, having kept the lives of the children! He was unable to protect some of them because he was badly wounded in a fight with Foreman Oyun... I wonder how he got out of there alive. He wants to sacrifice the Tower in order to save the Settlement for me."
539706, "I understand, Victoria. But I must fulfill my mission. That is my duty."
539707, "Well, Victoria, rejoice-it aligns with my own intentions. I will take Burakh to the Cathedral and vouch for him in front of the Commander."
539708, "She thinks the Tower is not for children. She thinks we've been taking someone else's place all this time. Now the one it has been built for will inhabit it. But the Tower is for children! Who are we if not the birds nesting among a factory's chimneys?"
539709, "Who will inhabit it?"
539710, "If I do, Kaspar... I'm afraid she won't answer me."
539711, "Did your sister know about the bull? "
539712, "Turns out you're a selfish and pettish child..."
539713, "So do I."
539714, "Did I? I don't seem to remember doing this..."
539715, "Is that so? I have already got used to the fact that Changeling can't remember what happened to her five minutes ago, let alone yesterday, but you didn't seem to have this problem before, oynon. On the other hand, we're all exhausted..."
539716, "Go on then. This information will be useful to me anyway-I've been tirelessly looking for the source all this time."
539717, "But it has already been spilled, as you can see. What are the Abattoir's thoughts on the matter?"
539718, "The Abattoir's voice is my voice now, oynon. And I'll tell you this: Oyun used to run things poorly. His bloodline was akin to mine, but he kept failing to learn the lines. He has commited numerous mistakes recently. I think it was he that dipped out the pest from the cavities five years ago."
539719, "A bold hypothesis. What about now? "
539720, "I suspect that he tried to bury the pest in the Steppe not so long ago. I have no idea why. That was the greatest sacrilege, and my father tried to intervene. He went to the Steppe to reinter this nightmarish burial ground. He must have burned it... but couldn't come out unscathed. You know how it went after that."
539721, "How probable is it that your father failed to destroy that... gulp?"
539722, "Well, I have already done it, haven't I? The vaccine has been produced."
539723, "As has been the serum. So why fret?"
539724, "Well, I never... Spoken like a truly wise man! Thankfully I, at least, can still keep a cool head! The town is inextricably connected to the soil, and the only way to defeat the disease is by destroying its source!"
539725, "By destroying the Tower... right?"
539726, "Even more beautiful? This ugly hellhole feels as though it was specifically designed for artillery testing!"
539727, "It's nice to see your zeal, commander. "
539728, "We're out of luck, commander... But I have to admit that your situation is much worse than mine was a week ago."
539729, "Why interrogate them? Whom did you place in charge of the execution?"
539730, "...Well. Turns out I've been doing the right thing all along."
539731, "Certainly. I have already dispatched two squads to search for them. Thankfully the town is not that big..."
539732, "I think I know which wall those volunteer executioners are standing by."
539733, "Still, I'll talk to the children. Perhaps they've managed to find something out already..."
539734, "Another couple of these scoundrel bands, and this long-suffering town will add civil war to the long list of its misery!"
539735, "Andrey! Now is the time. I have come to talk business. "
539736, "'Tracking Down the Haruspex'"
539737, "Aglaya asked me to find Burakh and warn him that he is in danger. I will be able to find him in the house described in the letter. However convoluted the phrasing is, I will be able to figure out the location."
539738, "I managed to find the Haruspex and deliver a timely warning. No matter what Aglaya's intentions are, she is going to pay my reward. "
539739, "I found the Haruspex, but decided not to disturb him. I wonder how well the Bachelor will pay to learn the location of his enemy..."
539740, "*** The Bachelor was generous enough. I wonder which of the two demons will come out victorious? If only it was a draw! If both survive, it will be most convenient!"
539741, "*** Burakh has slipped away, and Aglaya returned the favour."
539742, "'Tracking Down the Bachelor'"
539743, "I need to find the Bachelor and warn him of the danger he is in. I will be able to find him in the house described in the letter. However convoluted the phrasing, I will be able to figure out the location."
539744, "I managed to find the Bachelor and deliver a timely warning. I hope the reward will be worth the trouble."
539745, "I found the Bachelor but decided not to disturb him. I wonder how much the Haruspex will pay to learn the location of his enemy..."
539746, "*** Apparently no price is too high for the Haruspex. I wonder which of the two demons will come out victorious? I'm afraid it will be a stalemate."
539747, "*** The Bachelor avoided the punishment. And I got what was coming to me."
539748, "Huh... Well, he won’t be able to deal with me on his own... But you've offed my companions, you deadly girl... Is he surrounded by henchmen as usual?"
539749, "Go away, Burakh. The sooner the better. Remember, I bring good tidings."
539750, "Are you staying here for long, Burakh? Any plans to go anywhere?"
539751, "I wouldn't have come to a place like this if I didn't have serious plans... Why do you ask?"
539752, "Be careful, Burakh. It's very dangerous here, as you can see..."
539753, "Would you like to finish the Bachelor in the same fashion? All you need is to catch him flat-footed. I know where he is, and he'll stay there for a while."
539754, "Off I go then. How much do you want for him?"
539755, "Here he is. Be careful, he bites painfully..."
539756, "I do know who you are hunting. Why are you staring at me like that? It's not me you're looking for but my sister.  Have you heard of the sister?"
539757, "Well then... I am unlikely to make you knuckle under. Give me the sister at least. She will do. I promise to give you something special for her."
539758, "Fine, Burakh... That's a good deal. Now look, I'll draw a map for you."
539759, "Why would I harbour hard feelings towards the dead? I've come to you with an open heart, you see... "
539760, "You're exactly who I'm looking for, the girl of notable peculiarity... What is it in your eyes? Are those tears? Today must be a bad day for one of us..."
539761, "I want to warn you. Go away from here, Cold Demon. Someone who wants to kill you will come here soon."
539762, "Oh, don't bother... I can't read hearts like you do, but I can read the poignant hatred in your eyes all right. You would be very happy if someone were to kill me... the cold demon, pah!"
539763, "...I wish she whom I need wouldn't value your life so much. I have special plans for her. Special! Go away, Bachelor."
539764, "Stay here, Bachelor. Don't go anywhere. That is all I wanted to tell you."
539765, "Why in the world?"
539766, "Oh, I'm not fretting, Bachelor... There's nothing for me to fret about now... "
539767, "But I'm not the only one you're looking for. You've got an enemy greater than me. Fight him-as you can see, I'm not trying to run away from you... and I won't."
539768, "Is he well-armed?"
539769, "There you go..."
539770, "No, it's not me that you're looking for, Bachelor. You are mistaken again. Don't be rash, don't say anything... Make sure for yourself first. And I'll show you where to look for my sister."
539771, "Are you sure I'm looking for the sister? All right, let's assume I believe there are two of you-one of you borderline saint and another, the carrier and the devil itself. But how do you know which one I need?"
539772, "Be careful! Now look, here's the house you need..."
539773, "Today is your bad day, Bachelor. Your henchmen are dead, you're welcome to check. That means they were bad people... "
539774, "I've got a strange letter from you... You're asking me to warn the Haruspex about the danger."
539775, "That is correct. Which part of that was not clear to you?"
539776, "The idea hasn't even occurred to me..."
539777, "I've found the Haruspex and warned him like you asked. The part where his beastly bodyguards almost tore me to pieces is, I suppose, too obvious to mention."
539778, "I won't forget this, girl. You've done a good deed... It goes without saying that I'm going to reward you and, from now on, trust you a little more... which will in no time reflect on the general local attitude towards you."
539779, "There was no need..."
539780, "The Bachelor had found your Haruspex even earlier than I did... How on earth did he manage?"
539781, "Burakh has escaped death. He's not easy to capture, even with a whole gang of followers... But were you really not involved? I have my doubts about that, Clara. And if my plan hadn't granted you a complete freedom of action..."
539782, "I understand. You'd have had me executed."
539783, "I've received a strange letter from you... Are you asking me to warn the Haruspex about the danger?"
539784, "Exactly. What's not clear about that? I will reward you if you do exactly as you've been told. Don't for a moment think I won't find a way to check. So no trying to deceive me!"
539785, "The idea hasn't even occurred to me..."

539791, "How could you say something like that! Unbelievable..."
539792, ""
539793, "What are you looking for here? Perhaps I haven't scared you enough?"
539794, "I've received a strange letter from you... Are you asking me to warn the Haruspex about the danger?"
539795, "Oh, that... Yes, yes, that's correct. I've overworked, that's all... Well, if you do it for me, I'll change my mind about you. I promise. And there will be a further reward."
539796, "Really? I didn't think that man was so important to you..."
539797, "I've found the Haruspex and warned him like you asked. The part where his beastly bodyguards almost tore me to pieces is, I suppose, too obvious to mention."
539798, "I won't forget this, girl. You've done a good deed... It goes without saying that I'm going to reward you and, from now on, trust you a little more... which will in no time reflect on the general local attitude towards you."
539799, "But can I hope that you'll stop hounding and hating me now? If you only knew how sick and tired I am of this already..."
539800, "The Bachelor had found your Haruspex even earlier than I did... How on earth did he manage?"
539801, "He has escaped death. He's not easy to capture, even with a whole gang of followers... But were you really not involved? I have my doubts about that, Clara. And if my plan hadn't granted you a complete freedom of action..."
539802, "Yes. I did it. Are you satisfied?"
539803, "I've cleansed another district. Are you convinced now?"
539804, "Maybe, maybe... So you think that if not for you, that district would still be infected now?"
539805, "Doubtlessly."
539806, "I can see you're telling the truth. And that's what matters the most to me now... Well then-carry on with your work. Mind you, I will find a way to ascertain if you've been telling the truth to me now. And here's the reward I promised you. Just make sure you remember our deal..."
539807, "I do remember."
539808, "We had a deal?"
539809, "It all depends on who's been to that district."
539810, "I'm not easily scared..."
539811, "I've received a strange letter from you... Are you asking me to warn the Haruspex about the danger?"
539812, "Exactly. What's not clear about that? I will reward you if you do exactly as you've been told. Don't for a moment think I won't find a way to check. So no trying to deceive me!"

539816, "Nice... Some kind words for you at last..."
539817, "The Bachelor had found your Haruspex even earlier than I did... How on earth did he manage?"
539818, "He has escaped death. He's not easy to capture, even by a gang of five... But were you really not involved? I have my doubts about that, Clara. And if my plan hadn't granted you a complete freedom of action..."
539819, "Yes. It was me. You shouldn't have treated me like that!"

539861, "I've received your letter concerning the Bachelor..."
539862, "Ah yes, the letter. I need to see this Bachelor urgently. Without him, we'll be unable to do anything at the Council tomorrow. But he's nowhere to be found, and to make things worse, I've heard that he has an axe to pick with that surgeon... And now this mutiny! It's driving me insane..."
539863, "I'll try to find him... Don't vex yourself!"
539864, "I've found the Bachelor and warned him. He'll be here soon."

539867, "The Haruspex had found the Bachelor before I could. All I saw was evidence of a fight."
539868, "Deplorable... most damnably deplorable. But I'm too tired even for despair at this point."
539869, "It's all right. It will all be fine..."
539872, "But why didn't you abdndon any and all business to stay with him? Why didn't you take him with you? "
539873, "Why would I? They didn't even know who Peter was and where he lived... He never reported to them, I hope... And even if he did, well, none of them got out of there alive."
539874, "What? Did something else happen? "
539875, "Yes. There are soldiers in your brother's studio! They're ambushing him there while others are combing the town searching for him!"
539876, "Come on, let's go find him. I go north, you go south. Take some pills with you."
539877, "Wait for me here, don't go anywhere! I'll find him. "
539878, "I'm here on assignment from general Block. Report the situation."
539880, "...Oh no. Something tells me there's been a mistaken identity issue... Ugh. And what am I supposed to do?"
539881, "What were you saying?"
539882, "Nothing. Just thinking aloud."
539883, "I'm asking on whose order you are here!"
539884, "Our immediate commanding officer is captain Longin, commander of the 15th Company. He is in charge of investigating the attack on the flamethrower corps' sanitary patrol. Any more questions?"
539885, "So you're telling me that general Block has no authority over you? He'll be excited to find out..."
539888, "This place is memorable to me. It was after making this ruin that I had an epiphany and realized how to erect my Tower heavenwards! And the mask... the mask came into my possession after my unsuccessful appointment as a master of cremations. So here I am, doing my job."
539889, "Go away from here, Peter. Go to Andrey. "
539890, "First I'll go to my place. I don't want to see anyone in this condition. Too much has burned to ashes inside of me. Too much has evaporated into thin air. I want to drown myself in a new flame."
539891, "Wait... Tell me, Peter, what have you constructed? What is it? "
539892, "Go away from here, Peter. Maria is waiting for you. "
539893, "There are soldiers in your house. They've found out where you live."
539894, "Haven't you had enough?"
539895, "No. Go in peace, Daniil. Or give the designs back!"
539896, "Fine. I'll go."
539897, "I'm in the clear. There is nothing for me to be afraid of. "
539898, "That's what you think. What if they confuse you for your brother?"
539899, "I was... strongly demoralized. And your bottles have had an effect. First I went to the Crucible. But there I was told that Maria had dozed off already. Then I came back home... found no traces of a trashing... and fell asleep. "
539900, "So you mean that Andrey was looking for you, but you were in the Crucible at the time... and it probably took you some time to get there, too. Where can he be now? "
539901, "If the soldiers were here, he could have gone to the Commander..."
539902, "I'm afraid you're right. "
539903, "Yesterday he attacked a patrol in an attempt to defend his brother... "
539904, "Ah! Yes, there was a madman here. Barged in shouting that his brother was innocent, that they're twins, that is was he who attacked the flamethrower corps. I've pardonned him because I have already been informed of the unauthorized actions of said corps. His actions were justified."
539905, "So are your soldiers disobeying you then? They're surprisingly quick to issue orders..."
539908, "So it was he who told you about the mutineers? "
539909, "I was there when he himself was informed about them. That is what saved me. I rushed to the cannon, started asking questions about an executed architect. They said they've arrested a lot of rabble-to execute at dawn. And then they offered special treatment to me-I barely escaped with a whole skin."
539910, "I see."
539911, "Then I rushed to the pub to find reinforcements and assault the cannon. That's where it gets stupid. It seems that I've raised so much noise by the cannon that they've made special inquires about me. They've sent a squad to the den..."
539912, "Okay, I know what happened next. How did you manage to break free? "
539913, "My faithful comrades have won me back. On our way here they told me that Peter came home and was sleeping like a log. I made sure it's true-and then I came back here to count my losses..."
539914, "Talk ahead then. Wait... Don't you want to know what happened to me at all? "
539915, "No. I want to know how you installed the Polyhedron. It was you, wasn't it?"
539916, "And what could have happened to you apart from more senseless lunacy? "
539917, "I see."
539918, "There's also a rumour that Andrey Stamatin, the architect that had murdered every soldier in his studio yesterday and set fire to a stone stairway later, was just executed by the mutineers. That's when the assault began. What is that supposed to mean?"
539919, "That was me."
539920, "So I am you! The furnace of this catastrophe has molded me, my brother, and you into a single person... The fire of war has molded us into a threefold bullet. It's natural. We are one. The three sides of a single process. Come to the Capital with us!"
539921, "Wait a minute... I think I've heard that already somewhere. Déjà vu... "
539922, "Really? Well, it's no wonder another smart person has pointed out the obvious to you."
539923, "Wait, it's too early to celebrate yet. Show me the design of the Tower's foundation."
539924, "Peace, Andrey. Remember what I had to suffer through for your sake today..."
539925, "It's not enough for me to have a look; I want to borrow them."
539926, "BONE HORN. Bos Primigenius, a beast from legend whose lines reflect all the intricacies and laws of the Universe, gave this bone to one of the first menkhu."
539927, "The truth and you are incompatible concepts! "
539928, "So the Changeling hasn't deceived me after all... and I thought she was the main source of all lies!"
539929, "Aglaya, how could you do this? This is an honest to God betrayal. I trusted you... "
539930, "What were you expecting? You seem to be overstepping your bounds, my dear... You are nothing but an individual, a bachelor of some sciences or arts; I, on the other hand, am an Inquisitor. People like you only exist to allow people like me to achieve their personal goals."
539931, "Personal! Not the goals handed down to you!"
539932, "Really, Dankovsky... Stop with the infantilism. You want to get back at the Powers That Be? So do I. And the best way to get even with them is to take their precious toy away. Or better yet, to turn it into ordinary utility equipment. That would be elegant and just."
539933, "So you assume that our goals coincide? "
539934, "No. I do not want to take revenge on the Powers That Be anymore. I want to take revenge on you, Aglaya. And I swear it'll work out perfectly!"
539935, "I wonder how."
539936, "You are powerless, Aglaya. And I am powerful. Because, heaven be praised, the Commander knows how to tell truth from lies. Whatever moves you make, he'll listen to me. So... "
539937, "I think you are right. This is exactly what I was expecting. I won't bid you farewell-I haven't made my final move yet."
539938, "So you are going to alter the truth to have a farewell jab at me? To preserve this diabolical Tower and raze the Settlement to the ground? Is that so? You are a hypocrite, Dankovsky... You won't have any self-respect after this."
539939, "We'll see."
539940, "I am sure of it. I hope the next day shows you without a shadow of a doubt that I am right. Remember how you've been managed all this time... and how blind you would have been, have I not opened your eyes to the truth you hold so dear. As for how I've used your epiphany... well, that's my business."
539941, "Damn you to hell, Inquisitor. "
539942, "Oh, no. That is my business."
539943, "You still do not realise who your true foe is, Dankovsky. We restore the mechanics of the Universe, you and I. We have built a logical chain of events and consequences. You swore to destroy the enemy and to be just. I gave you a chance to keep your word. A chance to win. And here's your gratitude..."
539944, "No. Now I realise who my true foe is perfectly well."
539945, "Hey! I can hear something in your voice... are those tears? Or is that how you laugh?"
539946, "What is a utopia, Aglaya? Let's talk for the last time. What is provoking your hatred so much?"
539947, "I am a humanitarian. My duty is to save people, not kill them. I only condemn a few to death for the sake of the many. Now I'm offering you to save the happiness of several thousands hardly shedding any blood at all. A utopia will demand more and more sacrifices, you know. Even this Utopia."
539948, "It's not your place to talk good and evil, Inquisitor. Stay here and watch me change the world."
539949, "But why do you think this place is a utopia? Nobody conducts social experiments here. Look, this place is more natural than nature. "
539950, "Utopias are usually constructed to embody perfect justice, liberty, or economical thrift. This one, however, is different. This town is not a 'place that does not exist'; it's a 'place that cannot exist'. Mustn't exist. Here's where the cause and the source are the same."
539951, "You're a bore, Aglaya Lilich. I'm tired of your pathos. "
539952, "Do elaborate on that, please. I'm still failing to understand where you see the root of all evil."
539953, "What does this shabby town have to do with it? Aren't you overselling it by calling it a utopia?"
539954, "I need to speak to Alexander Block. He's here. "
539955, "Here? No. He will only arrive at seven o'clock in the evening, a person of exemplary punctuality and honour that he is! "
539956, "What powers? "
539957, "You'll find that out if every person whose life had been in your hands for the last twelve days has a chance to say a word before the council. Every single Bound person."
539958, "Some of them deserve death. "
539959, "Undoubtedly. It has nothing to do with morals-it's about whether or not they will be able to speak up by the time this town's fate is decided. History loves to connect human lives into chains. Misplace one link-and the whole chain is broken."
539960, "Why should the powers that block my the entrance to the Cathedral care about these people? "
539961, "You are too inquisitive, my dearest Bachelor! You don't have to worry about higher powers. You don't have to know why it had all been arranged like this. Who dies, dies. Do your deed. If you want to be present at the Council, fulfill your obligations."
539962, "What obligations are you talking about, you creature in a beast mask?"
539963, "There are a few lives that you personally are responsible for. If these people are safe and sound by the evening, you will be allowed access to the Council. You will have a chance to tell Aglaya Lilich what you think of her."
539965, "There is no particular need in that... "
539966, "Yes. I am extremely inquisitive. "
539968, "By the evening all of them will be well. "
539969, "Let it be so. "
539970, "I never gave my consent to be in charge of anyone!"
539971, "Wrong. Even if that is your opinion, your conscience must think otherwise. Were you aware that they depend on you? You were. Could you have kept them away from harm? Absolutely. Have you been notified in advance that this is how it's going to end? Definitely. Which means...?"
539972, "Is it still possible to remedy the situation? "
539973, "There's very little time left. Burakh has produced several portions of his concoction. Some people may still have shmowders left; some may have shmowders. If you're one of those lucky few, then good for you! You're welcome to make the round. Offer the medicine to the vulture-faced corpsebringers standing watch by the doors, waiting to hear the owners' last breath... All is not lost yet."
539974, "Wait for me. "
539975, "I know what it means without your help."
539976, "How many people would you like me to bring to life?"
539977, "'Would like to'? Us? He must be having a laugh at our expence! We would like nothing. What I find surprising is that you wouldn't like it all that much either, Bachelor! And it's not about 'how many', it's about 'which ones exactly'; although you must know the answer to that question well enough!"
539978, "What if I don't?"
539979, "Then you're not as smart as everyone's been portraying you to be all this time... But don't be sad. You won’t need do be smart inside. The only thing that matters to the Inquisitor is sheer resolve, and the Commander is all about emotions now."
539980, "Which people exacly should stay alive?"
539981, "The people who you had been charged with protecting. The people whose fates you have without second thoughts taken into your own hands afterwards. Rings a bell? Aren't you keeping the list of all those people in a chest pocked, close to the heart? Or in that clumsy carpet bag of your? I wonder what it's stuffed with-I've always been curious and never had a chance to ask..."
539982, "The cheeks of cheeky guys and arses of smartarses. Like you."
539983, "I get it."
539984, "All right. Wait for me. "
539985, "We are not going to wait for too long though. Time is in short supply. You have until ten o'clock."
539986, "Damn it! "
539987, "Then let me see the Inquisitor. We have a lot to talk about before the Council begins."
539988, "No, Bachelor. You will meet them at seven o'clock and not a minute earlier. New powers have come into play now-the powers that even a government Inquisitor cannot oppose. We are only doing their bidding."
539989, "But Eva's dead..."
539990, "She, apparently, does not think so. This unfortunate girl is the only friend of yours that has really done something for you. You won't ever have to take care of her now, yet her voice will be heard. She pleaded and spoke for you."
539991, "...And the others? "
539992, "So that's what her letter was about... "
539993, "How about I pull your nose, Executor? You won't have a chance to strike back, after all. You have no hands."
539994, "Do I hear laughter from under your ugly beak?"
539995, "Funny... Now everything will be decided. The Inquisitor lass seems to think she has used you. Confused? Don't you fret! She's also nothing. Everything was leading to this. You are now acting in the interest of inevitability. You can't get away from it. Evil conquers all."
539997, "I laugh at you, person in a mask. "
539998, "In my opinion, there is a plot against the Inquisitor. I do not want to become the weapon raised against her by the hands even more devious..."
539999, "Are you talking about Clara?"
540000, "Yes. About the Changeling."
540001, "Clara the saint? No. The thought never even occurred to me. "
540002, "Live, Andrey. Keep a close eye on Peter. You'd become desperate and turn into a villain without him."
540003, "Live, Judge. Live for as long as you need to execute your decision."
540004, "Farewell, puppeteer. Best of luck in your creative endeavours. ...Is that how my line is supposed to sound, right?"
540005, "Live, Vlad. I think you'll make an ideal husband to Maria. It was obvious that the Kains and the Olgimskys were supposed to unite one day."
540006, "Live, Peter. Work and dream. Hold Andrey's hand-or he may do something bad... "
540007, "Looking at you frightens me. It seems to me like an unimaginable creature living in a star-filled abyss looks at me back through Victor's eyes..."
540014, "Let the Settlement be destroyed. But don't fire at the tower of glass. It must survive the tremor of an artillery barrage."
540015, "I'm surprised to hear that from you... How can you prove that it's a wise direction to take?"
540016, "Bachelor will. I trust him. And I know nothing about the Tower except that it contains the life that my father has instructed me to preserve."
540017, "We will now be talking to you, Bachelor Dankovsky. Artemy Burakh! Are you sure that you have nothing more to tell me?"
540018, "I am sure, general. I've made my choice."
540019, "Let the Settlement be destroyed, but there's no reason to hurt the Polyhedron. The survivors will find shelter there until we vaccinate them and the epidemic dies out."
540020, "So you think that the town is doomed? "
540021, "I do. The soil underneath it is soaked with poison. We're very lucky that the ground here is so fastidious. Plough every inch of it up with shells, shake it and pull its rocks out, split it into cracks so that no one would ever dare re-inhabit this land. This side of the river is uninhabitable."
540022, "I see. And you believe that the Tower will make it through the bombardment despite its base being so thin?"
540023, "Yes. The tower must keep its balance. I've studied its structure and I'm inclined to believe that it's rather earthquake-resistant. It's like a weight on a steel spring. If no shell explodes on the opposite bank of the river, the Polyhedron will remain intact. "
540024, "Shells will only fall where I point them to fall."
540025, "Let it be so then."
540026, "How do you prove that this choice is sensible?"
540027, "Here are my arguments. The panacea; the evidence of an underground blood deposit that feeds the town; my rightful and supported claim to take this blood."
540028, "Come see me at the Crucible, Daniil... I am expiring fast, I can barely hold the pen with which I'm writing this... My voice will fail me soon. I want to see you one last time./n/nMaria"
540029, "A Message from Maria"
540030, "*** This is out of the question. These are merely unarmed townsfolk. If I set the soldiers at them then it will be a massacre! I'd rather they make a commotion for a while and go home unharmed."
540031, "A disturbing letter has arrived from Victor Kain. It seems there is a storm gathering over the Crucible. Since he's phrasing it so, I probably shouldn't ignore Victor's request."
540032, "I have found Burakh and relayed your request to him."
540033, "...What did he say?"
540034, "He said he has nothing to tell you for now. He's going underground, drawn by the echoes of some events connected to his father's death."
540035, "Ah, how untimely... We might have to resort to using a blind pawn. Yes, I'll give that Changeling a chance... It could go well. I am grateful to you, Dankovsky, and deeply indebted. My errand must have cost you dearly."
540036, "Obviously. I'm almost broke."
540037, "Well, it cost more to those who were getting in my way."
540038, "I won't go down without a fight, you lowlives! "
540039, "What makes you think that? We'd love to shoot you-whoever you are. Thirty people have walked this path today already; two of them have bought the return ticket though. We only accept panacea. Here it is, see? I'm keeping it close to the heart. So what, lucky guy, got a panacea?"
540040, "I do. Take it and let me go in peace... "
540041, "I'm actually quite intrigued by your own vial..."
540042, ""
540043, "Oh, it was so scary... You got out, right? So you're not mine yet..."
540044, "No, no, sweetheart... I am not yours yet... "
540045, "Listen, I can't feel my legs, and my lungs are heavy... Could you please take a closer look at me?"
540046, "You are all covered in bullet holes... How did you survive? This cannot be... "
540047, "Oh... Where are the soldiers? Have they left? "
540048, "No, no, they're there-smoking by the fence... Can't you hear them talk and laugh? "
540049, "No... I hear nothing, my ears are bursting... I can hardly hear you... Do you have bandages? I need to have my wounds dressed..."
540050, "I do, I do! We're so very much in luck today-I've just gotten some new ones to tend to the people from Andrey's den, and I do have some left... Many people were killed there, you know, and some of them came here..."
540051, "What people... from the den...? Who was killed there? "
540052, "Do you have... weapons? "
540053, "There was a terrible fight... First they were attacked, five were killed, two were wounded. Then they got together, there was an awful lot of them-and they went somewhere... And came back with Andrey. They brought two people dead and seven wounded... That's who I tended to."
540054, "I see... So he managed to get away with it... Do you have any weapons?"
540056, "They've taken everything from me... I've got nothing left..."
540057, "Here, I have something I took from the wounded, they forgot it here... See, a carving knife and small tourniquets... I also have cotton wool and lint... "
540058, "No need for the... cotton wool and lint... Give me the knife! "
540059, "Give me everything! So you're saying they're smoking behind the wall, huh... "
540060, "...I feel like a punctured tank, I'm bloody leaking... And my head... Damn it!"
540061, "'The Messenger'"
540062, "The Haruspex buries himself deeper into the body of the town. It makes Aglaya nervous, wondering as to how the messenger is doing. This is convenient. I will ask him to do what I could not; to see if there is some kind of wormhole down below, where these horned bacteria may thrive."
540063, "Haruspex is determined to carry on. He wants to be left alone and says he will notify me himself. All for the best; I'd rather return to my own research, without him prowling around. Why did he give the Inquisitor the attitude though? Would he be as daring if she was stood right there next to him?"
540064, "*** Burakh went deep. On the one hand, I hope he emerges with some useful data. On the other, I would be the last man to mourn him if he does not."
540065, "Apparently, Andrey did not manage to get to the firing squad before me. They took me for him, which means they won't be bothering him any further. I wonder where he is, though... Perhaps someone in the twyrine shebeen would know."
540066, "Apparently, Andrey did not manage to get to the firing squad before me. They took me for him, which means they won't be bothering him any further. I wonder where he is, though... Perhaps someone in the twyrine shebeen would know."
540067, "No, no, you're right..."
540068, "The young lady Olgimsky probably has the most untainted view of whatever is going on inside that mysterious Tower on the Other Side. I'll ask her."
540072, "' Polyhedron. This is the price that has to be paid for procuring enough raw material to create tons of panacea. I would keep the Settlement, of course; an abandoned dangerous place is a hundredfold worse than an inhabited one that's ruled with resolve."
540073, "So you would demolish the Polyhedron... That's your price for saving the town. But how would this powder keg of a settlement be ruled?"
540074, "I would tackle the hardest task myself, ruling the dome that's covering the depths. The living part that has a protective crust I'd pass over to the new generation of rulers brought up by Capella. If another outbreak ever happens... we'll have enough panacea to nip the epidemic in the bud."
540075, "I suppose I could help them."
540076, "Really? Then I could present the Commander with arguments in favour of a proposal that will preserve the town at the cost of destroying the Tower. This is a wise arrangement, and-as my heart tells me-a lasting one. I'm thinking about the future of my community."
540077, "What do you need for that?"
540084, "Sounds right."
540085, "Why? "
540086, "Because I have to take care of several children-my confidants, that are to rebuild the Settlement and turn their lives to become the angles of its foundation."
540087, "So you still hope to make the Settlement suitable for life? "
540088, "The next generation of rulers? You mean your bound children?"
540089, "Yes, exactly. Olgimskaya has marked them, and her mark is not of this world. She is never wrong. Say; if you took it upon yourself to take care of them, I'd have the time to prepare my arguments before evening and could attended the Council well-prepared. But Changeling has ruined them... and now some of them are dying."
540090, "So your Bound are children?"
540108, "Is that where they are? I'd like to pay a visit, then. "
540109, "Too late. Nothing can be changed at this point. You can't leave until you make a decision. Don't regret that you never saw them. Some day I will tell you everything... won't be able to show you, though."
540110, "Too bad..."
540111, "Yes... This happens."
540112, "Got it."
540113, "I will."
540114, "If the Town is destroyed, that spells her doom as well. I could have killed her by giving the Bachelor the right to decide. I know what he would have done."
540115, "So what? You don't want to do this?"
540116, "No. I would've told you if I did."
540117, "So you've lost?"
540118, "No, I haven't. There's another way we can procure blood. Tear the Tower down."
540119, "I'll try to do something. How can I recognise your confidants?"
540120, "I wrote to you about them the other day. But in case you lost that letter, I'll tell you how to spot them. They all want one thing, and that's to preserve the marvellous Tower. Nothing else matters to them."
540121, "I'll do my best to help you. How do I recognize your Bound?"
540122, "All of them are listed in the letter that I sent to you several days ago. And... they're easily recognizable. The persecuted, the outcasts, the villains, the criminals... those whose only shelter is me, the new Mistress!"
540123, "How will they paint it?"
540124, "Anew, Warden. The triangle this town was standing on is going. There will be no more Utopian Scarlet, Termite Navy, Humble Taupe. There will be gold, amber, lilac, malachite, black, and dawnish beige."
540125, "I hope you explain the meaning of these colours to me one day."
540126, "Yours will be charcoal. Don't be distressed, it has its own beauty. But its role is different. Along with my white it will be used when mixing colours to receive various tints."
540127, "And the others? What colours will you assign to them?"
540128, "That's beautiful. This palette is more robust than the previous one."
540129, "I never thought you were superstitious. "
540130, "I am already becoming the Scarlet Mistress, Burakh! Even if I were the last living creature on this earth, surrounded by barren desert; even then I would have become one. It's not within your power to stop this."
540131, "Then at least do not regret your most precious thing. The Polyhedron will be razed to dust in a few hours."
540132, "I respectfully bow before a new Mistress..."
540133, "The twinkle in your eye betrays the truth. You made him do it!"
540134, "You are indeed the blood-red queen... I shudder at the mental image of your hypothetic reign-and the rivers of blood you are intending to spill."
540135, "Well, as for me, I'm totally fine with the Bachelor's choice."
540136, "Then pay a visit to Maria, the Scarlet Mistress, the one whose ascension your dear Bachelor is looking to ensure. Go to her after giving up your right to make the choice; go-she's daydreaming still! She won't stoop to hiding her real intentions from you; she's absolutely convinced that puny insignificant babies like Victoria or me can do nothing to get in her way."
540137, "Is she now? I think I will indeed pay her a visit..."
540138, "Farewell, Simon. I've found you at last... sir."
540139, "I've already done what I wanted. My life expectancy was low anyway. Why should I stretch my last days, accumulate diseases and grow to become a burden for my relatives? No... the best thing I can do now is to give way to my niece."
540140, "I have finally realized what my part is, you know. I'm good at breaking through to where no one is supposed to. And I'm really good at breaking rules, at challenging and contradicting. But I have no idea how to build something..."
540141, "I'm seeing you for the last time today."
540142, "The Polyhedron will become for the new town what the Abattoir used to be for the old one. A hub, a nursing organ, a source of vital power, and the origin of its history. "
540143, "How is it possible?"
540144, "Isn't it too fragile to become a foundation?"
540145, "It is a prism. It will refract sunrays, focussing them and inseminating the other bank of the river with its blessed warmth. It will all be about the solar cycle. The spots will shift and move following the laws of every calendar."
540146, "Your design is thought through in detail, as I can see."
540147, "Oh, no... I am not a geometrician; arithmetics is not my element either. But everything I'm describing is in my plain sight. I had enough time to fall in love with my design. I will heat up the new town with my rampant passion while it's being built. It will take years. But I'll bring it to life in the end."
540148, "What will your new town be like?"
540149, "We will build it so that various points of its space would awaken inaccessible and unexplored ideas and feelings in those who come there. We'll lay routes so that anyone following them would end up becoming a different person after reaching their destination."
540150, "Are you going to remove the children from the Polyhedron? What will happen to it?"
540151, "You will inform them beforehand, of course, won't you?"
540153, "It's not about manipulation at all! Everything that can be discovered will be discovered. Everyone who takes to the road is free."
540154, "For example?"
540155, "The Polyhedron, the beginning and the starting point of the new town, can accumulate childhood and its own magic. Routes, space, and structures that will stretch from the Polyhedron will be able to ignite other flames in people who have left the Tower..."
540156, "Can it all be truly possible? Can you really do it?"
540157, "Can it all be truly possible? Can you really do it?"
540158, "I am not alone. Moreover... I am not showing you my real power. You're leaving today, aren't you? So remember me for who I was. Remember me not as the Scarlet Mistress, able to grab your life, ignite you, and drag your whole being along, but as a girl with her life hanging by a thread."
540159, "Don't forget that your destiny hasn't been determined yet. It is still hanging by a thread."
540160, "Who told you I'm leaving? I am staying here."
540161, "Perhaps I'll come back here one day. I surely will if I don't forget the way."
540162, "What is there not to get, oh esteemed and wisest of bachelors?"
540163, "You were a puppeteer. Your Masks foretold our future-or maybe they imposed it upon us; in all honesty, I don't see the difference. All this time I was absolutely positive you were connected to the plague."
540164, "I thought that the whole point of the Utopians' ideology was neglecting the laws of fate and the limits it imposes upon us."
540165, "You are correct, oh the keenest of the astute! So what? I have cognized this side of Existence from backstage, so to speak; from where the strings go and the machinery is hidden-and yet I willingly swore allegiance to the Utopia. Does that tell you nothing?"
540166, "It doesn't tell me enough. You are, as always, a double-dealer..."
540167, "I don't believe you've changed. And you being with them is fearsome to me. You are an alarming tone in the jubilant orchestra of creators. "
540168, "Pff... You know, I'm glad you're leaving. You are a dangerous person, dealing with you would be and arduous task..."
540169, "You're back to being annoyed already? And I was just planning to ask as to what you're going to do with your life."
540170, "Me? Hahaha... That's ridiculous! And it's very tactless of you to ask me a question like that! Oh no, no offence taken... by me; you haven't offended me, after all-you've offended the Scarlet Mistress herself. My life belongs to Maria now... And I am merely her humble servant... always at her service."
540171, "I know who you are! You are the devil... Well, seems like you can't be done without. Especially with the Utopians."
540172, "You know, I've just realized why you haven't been infected even once... You've never been among my volunteers! "
540173, "Yeah, well... That was an unexpected turn of events-even for myself. It all happened very fast. The last few days, I mean."
540174, "You were such a loyal son... I was sure you were to follow in your father's footsteps."
540175, "But you are an abhorrent criminal... You have sentenced several thousands people to death. Their blood is on your hands."
540176, "I am still a loyal son. Who told you I was denying my family's values and power? That's like genes-one cannot change them. Even if I abjured the ideas my father believed in, I cannot abjure his lines... But that's Steppe knowledge... Burakh could tell you all about that."
540177, "Yes, that's true. So what? I would be an even worse criminal if, having known of the impending epidemic, I wouldn't have taken urgent steps, but rather allowed the infected rabble enter the town. There was a hope that the disease would burn out if we board it off-just like five years ago. That's just the role I had to play. "
540178, "Your father... Do you want to be like him?"
540179, "He is a boös, a bullman and a master of bulls. He is a man of primeval age; of the age that has long sunk into oblivion. He was born by the very damp and dense epoch that gave birth to the Kin and its values. I respect him and... I love him. You can see what he's done for me. But the age of aurochses and bisons has irretrievably ended."
540180, "What are you going to do now? "
540181, "I'm worried that a man like you-the one who was dealed this very role and played it all too easily-is suddenly among the Utopians!"
540182, "There might be a higher purpose to that, you know. After all, Nina the Wild never held human lives in high regard..."
540183, "What are you going to do now? "
540184, "I'll serve Maria. I'll be her hands. Her practical mind. I'll be her accountant and her chancellor. I'll estimate the price of her ideas and outbursts and I'll estimate the price of her every dream. You know, it happens-some business-like people are also surprisingly mad."
540185, "Yes. I know. "
540186, "Well... You have surprised me, Olgimsky. Farewell."
540187, "Here's what's going to happen. The part of the town on this bank of the river will be deserted. The people who will have found shelter in the specular cocoon will become its new inhabitants. "
540188, "What are you going to build? "
540189, "My brother and I will build the whole town. The Cold Hall will look like a mudpie in a sandbox compared to it.  I've designed it in my mind already."
540190, "Really? Tell me. "
540191, "That was an effulgent epiphany, a true eureka moment. My brother and I have planned the space already. We have laid roads, placed suburbs and districts... And when we saw the whole thing and realized how much energy was hiding in it... you know, we exchanged glances. It will rival the cities of the greatest ancient civilizations! "
540192, "When did you do that? "
540193, "So I've made the right choice after all... You alone are worth bringing a gang of criminals and scoundrels into power."
540194, "That town of yours will only exist on paper... Like with the Polyhedron, it will turn into a full-sized model of itself-made of its own designs..."
540195, "You're wrong. But why should I prove anything to you? Time will tell."
540196, "All right. I hope you will stop sinking in the green whirlpool. The herb is pulling you to the bottom already. There is neither warmth nor light there. "
540197, "It's simple. I won't be staying here long. When everything is finished and I make sure that my daughter has become the Scarlet Mistress, I'll relocate to Focus. I belong there. "
540198, "But if the town is destroyed, the Crucible will be razed, too. Only splinters and heaps of dead stones will remain here. "
540199, "The vial that Burakh gave me is strangely heavy and warm to the touch. I wonder what is inside? I need to study the contents under the microscope immediately."
540200, "What an interesting blood sample... I need to talk to Burakh about it!"
540201, "The gift wasn't mine to give. Don't put it like that."
540203, "You are not alone, Andrey. "
540204, "Exactly. There is no Andrey, only the brothers Stamatin, the twins. We are worthless without one another, and together we are worth more than any of the old school masters. For Peter's fantasies have no limits-he's too naïve for that-and I have the genuine freedom of action."
540206, "Hey, hey, you keep your hands to yourself... Little doll! A litle doll smarting around!"
540207, "A doll? Me?"
540208, "Yeah... Well, you personally have grown a bit big..."
540209, "I'll rip your heads off."
540210, "You don't conform to anything."
540211, "...You are also absolutely wild. A pointless atavism, evolutionarily speaking. I've been looking for a reason to tell you this since university."
540212, "You love superlative degrees too much."
540213, "And this is exactly why I'll be able to implement anything invented by Peter and blessed by Maria's love. Neither death nor depth nor the Law itself will stop me. All in all, I'm staying. I love this future pyre. It makes me feel like a demiurge."
540214, "I envy you, Andrey."
540215, "I don't think so-I'm pretty sure we'll meet in the Capital soon enough. Your first drink will be on me."
540216, "I told you already of the idea to construct a building with variable density... or was it someone else? But there is also a knot-house, there is a house that erupts from itself-an inside-out-house, so to speak, but without the 'inside' part... an encircled suburb that is at war with the centre, a bridge suburb... And, of course, a growing house that changes every week... "
540217, "How could you possibly invent all that? Are you really going to build all those things? "
540218, "It wasn't I that have saved your life, Mark Immortell. I want everybody to hear that! I would have killed you if I could."
540219, "You are fading away quickly, Judge. Life is leaving you. How much do you have left?"
540220, "Not much. But I do not need much. Pretty soon the spirit will find a more worthy vessel than this old body."
540221, "What burden do you bear, Judge?"
540222, "It is a joyful burden. By taking it in I have finally found everything I used to be lacking-everything I was so jealous of in my brother! But... yes, now it's become obvious to me how much fuel these qualities require! It costs me as much energy as a week of concentration to even think about them..."
540223, "How long will you last, Judge?"
540224, "What about your spirit? What happens to you, Judge?"
540225, "But in reality all you do is always keep him in mind and think things he would have thought... right?"
540226, "Indeed, my boy. Indeed. Now let us not talk about it anymore-it disturbs my peace... and weakens me."
540227, "I admire for your courage, Judge."
540228, "What does my spirit matter compared to Simon's? And it is not going to stay long in the specular trap either. It's not even cozy there. When the new town is founded, Simon will dissolve in it, I'm sure."
540229, "I admire for your courage, Judge."
540230, "Your mind is going, Judge."
540231, "You are speaking to me as if I were a gosling... I might be failing to understand something."
540232, "What will happen to this place? "
540233, "Here's how it's going to be. The town on this bank of the river will be deserted. A new town will be built on the other bank of Gorkhon-a town bigger, freer, and more beautiful. The people who will have found shelter in the specular cocoon will become its new inhabitants. Everything will change for the better."
540234, "But Focus is not quite a place. It will survive the destruction of the town. You can how tiny these houses are... Focus is nothing more than a mere toy. And the Polyhedron will be sufficient to everybody. We'll get along well with Simon. And when a new town is designed, we'll dissolve in its features."
540235, "So there will be a new town? "
540236, "My mind is confused... I wish your victory hadn't been bought at a price of your madness, Victor. To tell you the truth, you are the only one here who has really gone mad..."
540237, "Last question... Tell me about Nina."
540238, "I see. "
540239, "She was a radiantly beautiful woman. A dark chestnut with an intricate hairdo. Her eyes were deep and of the colour of French plum; her features were noble. Her only failing was the tendency to blow her nostrils, but that was hardly noticeable-they were thin and tight and elegant."
540240, "That's excusable. What else? "
540241, "I can see now that you really loved her very much..."
540242, "She was carefully minding her P's and Q's. She had an imperial deportment. Nina was very tall and her waist was so thin that a man could clasp it with his two palms. She liked cinnamon and black cherry. Will that be enough?  "
540243, "Thank you. That will be enough. "
540245, "ANDREY STAMATIN'S BLUEPRINTS. A supplement to the Polyhedron blueprints. They describe the terrible foundation which allows the Tower to stand, defying the laws of physics and geometry. The supplement also contains all the relevant calculations."
540246, "Victoria, do you know Katerina's successor?"
540247, "Oh, this is so very complicated... First I was absolutely positive that it was Clara. For a long time I was sure Clara was the Plague itself... I'm ashamed to admit it now that I know for sure that she is a real miracle-maker. Perhaps even a saint..."
540248, "So what? Can't she be Katerina's successor?"
540249, "Why don't you think so now? "
540250, "No. A saint can't be the Mistress of Earth... I think. These ideas are incompatible. Even though she says that everything she does-even the horrible deeds-she does for the greater good... Oh, I'm so confused. Even now that I have been assured of her sainthood, she just seems... disturbing to me."
540251, "Because sometimes it seems to me that there truly are two Changelings-a good one and an evil one. On the other hand, I know for sure that it cannot be so. She doesn't seem deranged to me, nor do I believe that she has split personality... All in all, it is all very weird."
540252, "What bothers you about Clara? "
540253, "Why? "
540254, "I am worried that she's clinging to the Commander too much. A very peculiar ally... Perhaps there's nothing bad about it. Perhaps she wants to influence him with her blessed power, to quench his cruelty... but there's something unnatural about this union."
540255, "Yes, perhaps you're right. "
540256, "Why? "
540257, "The sixth sense has never betrayed me. It is as though she was looking for a powerful destroyer in him. Or maybe she is just tricking him to subdue his will... In any case, I don't like it."
540258, "I know what you mean. This Changeling is very dangerous..."
540259, "Your Bound are alive and well. Come to the Council."
540260, "Fine. I will. If you tell Block yourself that you're on my side, the Inquisitor will be disarmed."
540261, "See you at the Cathedral, oynon. "
540262, "No, oynon... On the other hand, I'll do just fine without you."
540264, "Your confidants are alive and well. I'll be waiting for you in the Council. "
540265, "If my confidants are alive, I will come to the Council with you, and there won't be a single Queen there that I won’t be able to convince to my cause! But are you absolutely sure they are alive? Do you really want me to come to the Council?"
540266, "Come to the Cathedral. I'll give you the right to decide. "
540270, "I've decided not to decide."
540271, "Indeed? So what am I to do now?"
540272, "You won't regret it. And now-goodbye."
540273, "*** Nothing keeps me from entering the Cathedral. I have a feeling, however, that the Cathedral is the real trap; not the Theatre as the warning suggested. I renounce my freedom of choice. Let someone else decide. Let it be as it may."
540274, "*** Nothing keeps me from entering the Cathedral. I have a feeling, however, that the Cathedral is the real trap; not the Theatre as the warning suggested. I renounce my freedom of choice. Let someone else decide. Let it be as it may."
540275, "*** Nothing keeps me from entering the Cathedral. I have a feeling, however, that the Cathedral is the real trap; not the Theatre as the warning suggested. I renounce my freedom of choice. Let someone else decide. Let it be as it may."
540276, "I have come to announce my decision: there will be no decision. I forego the right do make a choice. I will not decide the town's fate and present my arguments to you."
540278, "I've said everything. Farewell, commander."
540279, "I have come. But I've changed my mind now. My choice is this: make this choice without me. I'm leaving."
540280, "You're out of your mind, surgeon. We won't be able to make this choice without you. We are at a deadlock. The Inquisitor is holding me back. I won't let her act-it seems to me that she is plotting to laugh her last dying laugh and let the disease loose in the end. Bachelor was tricked, Clara is compromised. You are the only one left."
540281, "I've said all I wanted to say. Farewell, general."
540282, "Well? Are you planning to make up your mind any time soon?"
540283, "I would still like to know how you're going to keep the town intact."
540284, "No, Bachelor! You will never understand this. You are very smart, but your intelligence holds you back. You will never come to understand my truth. Even though you're close to Maria and believe in Simon's abilities, you are still all too far from understanding the higher purpose of things. And my truth only comes together on that level..."
540285, "Why are you so displeased with my intelligence? "
540286, "Your victory is a victory of pure reason. Look-just like we all, you have reconstructed a picture of the whole Universe and found the root of what happened, but your picture is austere and barebones... You have merely come to understand the mechanics of the events. You are generally a mechanic of a medic."
540287, "Who are you then? "
540288, "Me and Burakh-we are different. And much more profound, believe me... Your world is mecnahically consistent and rational! You want to keep what is reasonable to keep and to destroy what is necessary to destroy in order to complete your tragic mission with minmal risk..."
540289, "Are you laughing at me? I want to keep the Polyhedron! What can be less logical? "
540290, "You want to keep the Polyhedron out of respect for the kindred genius who has calculated the mechanics of a miracle trap-a contraption able to capture what should not be captured! The Polyhedron is only a cold mathematical masterpiece made of glass to you! It's a very different thing to me..."
540291, "Look at you... it's like you're possessed by someone else."
540292, "Perhaps it's not the same me you knew before. There is more than one me... a lot, perhaps. We've got the same pretty face-but who knows whose will is behind it right now?"
540293, "Enough. Do whatever you please... "
540294, "No, I won't give you an opportunity to make a choice!"
540295, "I never thought you were superstitious. "
540296, "Is it true that the Commander has acknowledged you as a heavenly harbinger and is now obeying your will?"
540297, "Would I ever have the right to be called a heavenly harbinger if I had my own will? Does the Commander serve me? Oh how stupid you are, Bachelor, when speaking of matters of this kind! The Commander is a knight. His heart is sensitive in a very unique way. He has realized who is to be served now!"
540298, "What is to happen to him now? I am not impartial to his fate too."
540299, "Are you afraid that he will die? Don't. The Powers That Be have in fact given his an order no less hypocritical than the one you've received... He will be spared, I think. They just need to find a new battle for him. So many fires, so many abysses he is to walk through-each of them eagerly prepared by the Powers to become his grave... Yet he is to overcome all hardships... "
540300, "To become a dictator and a tyrant eventually! "
540301, "With your help, is what you're trying to say, right?"
540302, "I shall accompany him everywhere. In every campaign I shall stand by his side... And he will always know where to strike for that will not be a choice for him. Terrible and numerous will his foes be, yet his force is to become unconquerable, empowered by my spirit."
540303, "So... you want to start a holy war? Under what banner? Who will believe you, Changeling..."
540304, "But you seemed to look at him as though he was doomed..."
540305, "Wait some more."
540306, "Look at them. You see now that she is a victim? Do not paint her a demon. She is just honestly doing her duty-like you or me."
540307, "You are protecting Aglaya. Do you really have something to say in her defence?"
540308, "I'm just still confused-what has she done to deceive you? Did she lie to you, has she withheld the truth? I think you've learned everything you have without her help. Every conclusion you've made is your own. The whole town was at your disposal."
540309, "She had to protect the town at any cost. That was her purpose. And yet she tried to settle personal accounts with her deceased sister while claiming to fulfill a noble duty."
540319, "That is true... but the point stays. I would have never become her ally, had she uncovered her true goal from the start."
540320, "I've changed my mind, Burakh. I'll make the choice myself. "
540321, "Then why have you brought me here? "
540322, "Just in case. In case something unforeseen happens. "
540323, "We have very different definitions of duty then."
540324, "What is your duty, oynon? "
540325, "Eradicating the infection from this world at any cost. You will see now how scrupulously I keep the promise imposed upon me from above."
540326, "Well... Her duty is rescuing the town. As far as I understand, the orders she had received from the Powers That Be didn't say a single word about the necessity of keeping the Polyhedron..."
540327, "...The Powers That Be foresaw that that would have put her on the scent of their foul play. They must have known where the filth is coming from..."
540328, "She has fulfilled her duty faithfulty and literally. Just like you do. She caught them cheating. Turned their own implications and half-truths against them. So why are you reproaching her? Both of you want to break the whole to spite the Powers That Be. Both of your choices are driven by the appetite for revenge."
540329, "No, Burakh. Peculiar that you're mistaken here too. I am driven by an entirely different feeling. And that feeling is love. "
540333, "I have no idea who you're talking about, Burakh. There is not a single woman here fitting your description."
540334, "I'm surprised to hear that from you... Can you prove that it's a sensible choice?"
540336, "Haruspex will. I trust him. He will speak the language of the scary tales of our long-lost childhood-the language I've forgotten already. Let him tell you of his relationship with this tribal kin. That's the recipe for saving the town, as far as I understand."
540337, "Now we shall speak with you, Artemy Burakh! Bachelor Dankovsky! Are you sure there's nothing else you'd like to tell me?"
540340, "We won't be able to make this choice without you. We are in a deadlock. The Inquisitor is holding me back. I won't let her act-it seems to me that she is plotting to laugh her last dying laugh and let the disease loose in the end. Haruspex is acting on the Inquisitor's behalf, Clara is compromised. The town is doomed... "
540353, "I will. Do you have your panacea? "
540354, "No, oynon, I don't. That's the problem. I'm out of panacea. I'll have to use the last flask and the last batch of ingredients at the Council, as an argument in favour of my proposal."
540355, "Are you aware that we turned out to be toys? "
540356, "Really? You're kidding... Though figuratively speaking... That is true-after a fashion. We are all mere toys in the hands of Providence."
540357, "No, I mean literally. You are a toy. I am a toy. We are mere dolls made of rags, sawdust, whalebone, and hell knows what else."
540358, "I always knew that you were a person of refined and philosophical mind, oynon... But I never expected to hear something like this-even from you. But... sure. I can't say it bothers me all that much. The Tale of the Daughters claims that men have been made out of most inappropriate trash."
540359, "We have masters. They are little kids. They are playing us right now."
540360, "I hope my side wins!"
540361, "No. You lose. They don't love us, by the way. They're fed up with us. That's why we're stuck here... they've stuck us here."
540362, "Like I said, I don't care all that much. Aglaya told me about this too, you know... She expected to stun me with the news, but I wasn't sad at all. Although I didn’t take her words that literally. But I'm honest with myself-so does it really matter what I'm made of?"
540363, "Well, it matters to me!"
540364, "You are also better-crafted than me, oynon. Take a look at us-a closer look. You are probably right about me, I'm not a toy to keep-unbending, leather-made, old, and shabby. You, on the other hand, are an entirely different thing! I'm surprised they're playing such a bad game with you..."
540365, "You're having fun... Somehow I fail to join in."
540366, "Yes. You have boggled my mind as well, Burakh. I think I'm beginning to understand how you've managed to impress the imperial diva. We upperclass people have already become disaccustomed to such stoicism. "
540367, "But I will have my revenge. Never again will they have the desire to play games of the kind... I've figured it all already."
540368, "Why? You two had the same purpose-overcoming the epidemic. And don't you tell me she doesn't want it. It's a matter of principle and professional honour for her. "
540369, "Her goal has been set in advance-destroying the Polyhedron. "
540370, "I saw a person serving the truth just as faithfully as I do in her-but she is a turnskin."
540371, "That's because she knew beforehand that the root of all misfortunes of this town lies there. Was she wrong? "
540372, "I have come across new information. I truly apologize."
540373, "Why? "
540374, "She came as a lightbringer capable of resolving all our misfortunes with the power of her intelligence-and ended up being a traitor that tried to sell me another lie under the guise of the ultimate truth!"
540375, "Yes, nothing to fault. It was executed so perfectly-not a single weak spot anywhere. But don't you see the difference? "
540376, "You're just holding a grudge, oynon, nothing more. You only feel betrayed because you've entrusted yourself to her-but that was your own choice. It's unwise to brand someone a savior beforehand and then denounce them when they fail to live up to your expectations-even though they didn't know you had them."
540377, "She knew. That's the difference. She knew and exploited my hopes. "
540378, "You brought this on yourself. Don't try to get even with Aglaya. If you want to destroy the town and save the Tower only to get to her-and push her towards her demise... that would be unbecoming of you, oynon. It is you who will turn into a spiteful puppeteer driven by his thirst for revenge..."
540379, "Oh my! Look at her-she's getting closer and closer to becoming a victim of my malevolent scheming with every word you utter!"
540380, "She is. The feeling  that hinders you now is rage, oynon. You feel deceived because you put too much hopes in those who have been guiding you all this time. Consider the fact that Aglaya has been guiding you according to her own truth. She is a servant of the Law."
540381, "It doesn't matter-she has deceived me and betrayed me. She treated me like a pawn, and I won't ever forgive her for that."
540382, "Yes, you'd make an excellent lawyer. A pity she can't hear us now. "
540383, "It's not about revenge. I just want to keep my word and to fulfill my mission fairly. "
540384, "My duty is to find out the truth and to act in good conscience. This is what both the Powers That Be and the Inquisitor have demanded of me-yet both of them have concealed the crucial truth."
540385, "Wait for me here. I shall speak to the Commander. He will call upon you soon."
540387, "That's just how the world goes."
540388, "The world doesn't work like you think it does. You've been taught wrong in that academia of yours. As for me, I know how to arrange it so that both the town lives and the Polyhedron stands. It will all be just like it used to be!"
540389, "And how will you arrange that?"
540390, "It's a secret. Something has to be sacrificed anyway... a lot, really... but these are things that actively want to disappear off the face of the earth. Nothing to regret about."
540391, "Curious. What kind of things? "
540392, "What do you care? They are but fuel that would allow to preserve the old state of being. Oh, the Powers That Be will be delighted. They really shouldn't have persecuted me! I could have offered them a wonderful gift."
540393, "What's the cost?"
540394, "Yet another secret! Curiosity killed a cat. My word is enough. I will keep it. I am a mystical creature. I am a Mistress!"
540395, "Are you now?"
540396, "Fine, I believe you. Go ahead."
540398, "Why? "
540399, "Because I want several outcast Bound to live-the ones that no one would take care of and caress but me... You have your own confidants, I have mine. I'll try to do something for them in these last few hours..."
540400, "Are your confidants in danger?"
540401, "Some of them are gravely ill. They are on the verge of death. It's partly your fault too, Bachelor... They wouldn't have fallen sick without your kind assitance, now would they?"
540402, "Fine. I'll check on your confidants and bring them back to life. How do I recognize them?"
540403, "My confidants are outcasts. Those who have accepted me as a new Mistress. They believe that I will be able to preserve the living Utopia. The town will remain the same. They will surrender their lives for that."
540404, "If they live, will you come to the Cathedral? "
540405, "I will."
540407, "Serves them right, the villains. "
540408, "So you've decided to play saint after all? Whatever..."
540413, "The Powers That Be... Don't you even speak about them! I've got a very particular account to settle with them!"
540414, "Whatever the Powers That Be claim, they don't really care about the disease. The town, the town, the town-in the precise state it's existing in now-that's their primary concern. The town whose juices flow to feed the blooming and active Polyhedron!"
540415, "And you think you could arrange that?"
540416, "I could arrange it so that everything stays the way it used to if I could get into the Cathedral and look the Inquisitor in the eye. But I can't. I have to care for my... confidants. They have put their faith in me already, you see. I cannot abandon them now."
540417, "I'll do my best to help you. How do I recognize your Bound?"
540418, "All of them are listed in the letter that I sent to you several days ago. And... they're easily recognizable. The persecuted, the outcasts, the villains, the criminals... those whose only shelter is me, the new Mistress!"
540419, "Wait for me. I'll take care of your outcasts. "
540420, "If my confidants are alive, I will come to the Council with you, and there won't be a single Queen there that I won’t be able to convince to my cause! But are you absolutely sure they are alive? Do you really want me to come to the Council?"
540421, "Yes, I am sure all your Bound are well. Come to the Cathedral. I'll give you the right to decide. "
540422, "I'll think about it. Can't help the distaste I have for some of your adherents..."
540423, "...A chimera! A greedy, insatiable chimera. I'm so happy it's not you who is to make a choice, Changeling."
540424, "Do you have a different solution?"
540429, "Are you aware that we're toys? "
540430, "Of course I am! Were you not?"
540431, "I wasn't... and you're so calm about it!"
540432, "Lil' puppets we are, true... but it's not the puppet that matters, but whose hands control it! Have you seen them?"
540433, "I have. "
540434, "They probably think themselves so big? Think they're real human creatures, lil' baby kids, don't they?"
540435, "...Aren't they?"
540436, "I wouldn't be so sure! I have a gut feeling about it! That's my knack, what can you do. And Haruspex is probably still thinking he's a haruspex, isn't he? Although he doesn't seem to care... He would have got on very well with those kids!"
540437, "I doubt that. "
540438, "Tell what you know! "
540439, "I have already told you everything. I don't know anything-but I sense a lot. See you, Bachelor!"
540440, "See you... "
540441, "How long were you aware of that?"
540442, "I'm aware of something else, too. I am. Almost everyone we've come across in the past few days are toys-honest to God toys. But some creatures here are more intricate..."
540443, "Who? "
540444, "You and me, for example. You surely understand quite a lot about yourself-you feel a powerful will standing behind you... And I'm going to surprise you quite a lot, tee hee... What would you have done if you knew beforehand?"
540445, "I would have acted more confidently."
540446, "I would have shot myself."
540447, "Turns out that you're a toy, Clara. And I'm a human being."
540448, "Are you sure? "
540449, "I am."
540450, "So I'm not human. That gives me a huge advantage over you."
540451, "Why? "
540452, "Because you think I'm a toy. I know who you are, but you don't actually know who I am. So I have an advantage."
540453, "How so? "
540454, "Who were you fighting all this time? Oh you human... "
540455, "The plague. "
540456, "Do you realize now that you have lost? And there's nothing to be done. It's too late."
540457, "All right. Let's go to the Cathedral. "
540458, "I'm tired of you! Your lies are so crafty it's too easy to mistake them for the truth. Even the Inquisitor is less skilled than you... "
540459, "The inevitability. "
540460, "Was I fighting you...?"
540461, "No, not really."
540462, "Why? Look at your hands. Are they really yours? No, not these ones... Now count them. Are there exactly two and not four? "
540463, "That's not funny. "
540464, "Do not pretend to be alive. "
540465, "I'm not pretending. But you shouldn't have called me a toy... I'll make you regret that... Tell me, who am I really? What do you think?"
540466, "A doll. "
540467, "No. That is my doppelganger. My twin sister. "
540468, "So I was mistaken. "
540469, "Whatever I choose, you will immediately change your essence. Is that what you're hinting at?"
540470, "I'm in your head now! This is what I'm hinting at. I am you!"
540471, "Whatever! I'm in no mood to argue..."
540472, "Fine. Score one for you."
540473, "...The Plague. "
540474, "A miracle-maker."
540478, "Let them shoot. I'm eagerly waiting for it all to go to hell!"
540479, "I hope this will not affect the course of war... "
540480, "Are you afraid that too much blood will be spilled before the light of truth triumphs over the world? Don't. Yes, guns will destroy many before the war is ended. But when it ends, it will end forever. All earthly kingdoms will unite and exist in consent, and there will be but one Law! "
540481, "Yes, this mission has become his first failure. He lost the army, failed to stop the plague and is now-with your help-going to break the order and rebel against the authority of a goverment Inquisitor. It may well be that he's bound to be sentenced to death. They're too afraid of him."
540482, "You know... I will not give you the right to decide. Or was this exactly what you were going after?"
540483, "But you need him alive. Why?"
540484, "I shouldn't have brought you to the Cathedral, Changeling! Thankfully I was smart enough to talk to you before making a decision."
540485, "You're laughing at me! In reality you already know he's doomed... "
540486, "Just don't you think I don't feel sorry for him. He's noble, honest, and a true hero-an Alexander! Yes, he is destined to die... but we will save the town. Make your choice, Bachelor."
540487, "I already have. You will have the right to speak."
540488, "No, I won't give you the right to decide... You are the vilest creature of all creatures I've met recently."
540489, "Both you and Burakh are semiliterate simpletons. So why are you both pitying me? Why won't you respect my knowledge as much as I respect yours?"
540490, "If it were so, I would not have taken you to the Cathedral, Changeling. "
540491, "There Maria stands-she looks at you hopefully, her velvet eyes already ripe with scarlet fire. What is she waiting for then? What is she doing here at all? "
540492, "She is waiting for my decision. "
540493, "I don't know. I haven't talked to her yet. "
540494, "Klara, you are plain stupid. You have understood nothing... "
540495, "Yes. I have come. "
540496, "I have already begun, my Daniil... When the night falls, and the wind scatters the smoke above the scorched earth, and the dust of the buildings demolished settles, you will see several new constellations light up in the sky. They will plunge their light towards us, and when the first specks of this light reach the castellations of the Polyhedron... a miracle will happen."
540497, "Where will these constellations come from?"
540498, "After what happens today, the only thing light in the sky will be that of Mars..."
540499, "They have existed for a long time already. People just couldn't see them before because their light was hurrying towards us from far beyond. Now the first rays of these stars are about to reach our surfaces. We will see their light reflected in the specular planes of the preserved Polyhedron."
540500, "What will they be like? How are you going to call them?"
540501, "I'll see. But I expect them to be mostly red. Ruby, scarlet, crimson, carmine, merlot, mahogany, vermillion, garnet, rose, pink, burgundy... Perhaps you may even notice something familiar in the structure of these constellations."
540502, "What will become of your family, Maria? "
540503, "Perishing, burning down, dissolving without a trace-this is my family's destiny. It happened to my mother; it happened to Simon. Tomorrow Georgiy dies, and my father will fade out in a week. And in ten years, when my town is complete, I will pass on in the same fashion."
540504, "What will happen to the children? Will you expell them from the Tower?"
540505, "There's nothing to be done about it. They have to free up the space for the new guests. My brother will become embittered, betray me, and rebel against me. But I will find a way to deal with him. He will cower behind Capella's back willingly when my mother's eyes frown and glare at him!"
540506, "So you won't be living forever... Well, that is your destiny, Maria."
540507, "Have you become a Mistress already?"
540508, "No, I haven't. You won't see it here-unless you're planning to stay, of course."
540509, "I won't. I'll leave the town on the military train at dawn."
540510, "I have considered the pros and the cons... I'm staying."
540511, "Why are you here, Maria? "
540512, "You ask strange questions. Don't you see that this is my town now? I am the power here. I am the mother, and since I am to give birth to a new town, I want to witness the demise of the old one. This is my duty. I am the last of the Kains."
540513, "What about your brother? Aren't you going to share your power with him?"
540514, "No need to hurry, Maria. In fact, I haven't made up my mind yet. "
540515, "...'Cause we've been to a funeral! They've been sending us out to the garden for ten days in a row so that we wouldn't get in anyone's way! They've been taking us to the cemetery for a week now, Bachelor. And if you keep being naughty, I'll take you with me next time and leave among the wreathes so that you know better!"
540516, "But why did you need dolls? Couldn't you have played without us?"
540517, "...So who died on you?"
540518, "No one did! No one ever does! Why is he asking about it..."
540519, "Hush, hush, no need to cry! Oh come on..."
540520, "See, doll? It was us, we've arranged all this. Turned out to be great! We've never made a world like this before. It's magical. We planted it and here's what has grown up. But now there's rot everywhere."
540521, "You're calling me a doll, you whelp?"
540522, "Hey, don't call me names! Take it easy! Okay, it wasn't me who's made you, but I've had you since I was three. You're a doll-ask anyone! Your name is Haruspex. You are a ripper. You're always a bad guy when we're playing. Your face is all bruised and messed up!"
540523, "Yeah, that much is true... the headache is splitting. How about I mess your face up?"
540524, "Really? So you're not a doll? Go ahead, hit me then. Well, why are you just standing there? I dare you! Hit me with everything you have!"
540525, "You will regret this, I swear."
540526, "What shall I do now?"
540527, "Stop moaning, get up and help us fix the town! You were doing well... Just a little bit left till the game is over. It's time for us to go home anyway."
540528, "It's time for you to go to a youth detention center!"
540529, "I don't believe you. You are not real."
540530, "I am a human being. It's you who is going to become a doll in my hands now, kiddo. "
540531, "I am a human being.  "
540532, "In that case you're a human being that closely resembles one of our toys. It's a Ripper, but we call it Burakh for fun."

540559, "Tell me who she is then."
540560, "Are you Olgimskys meaning to kill her?"
540561, "Ah, so that's why... Now I see clearly what's scaring her so much!"
540562, "That's the worst part. Had they done it for profit, their actions, however abominable, could have at least been explained. But their motives were a mystery. They'd take the best, and leave disfigured freaks in their place; and the children would become performers with their Caravan."
540563, "Was Anna with the Caravan too?"
540564, "What did they need those children for?"
540565, "That's horrible... And what did they kidnap the children for?"
540566, "To replenish their troupe. They were collectors. Do you realize how the Kains must have hated them? The Caravan turned up at the exact time our children had settled at the Polyhedron, and the Kains saw that they had given the little ones of the town a magical childhood. The Caravan stood at the opposite pole, as it were: a challenge, a mockery, a reminder for Nina and Simon..."
540575, "But none the less powerful for it, aren't I?"
540576, "Oh, for how much longer are you all going to torture my father? No, he is not to blame for anything! Anything whatsoever! Remember it, in case anyone points the finger at him in the future! Why did I only give him my word..."
540577, "Someone's been sending anonymous threatening letters to Anna. She's convinced your father wants to punish her for something."
540578, "He doesn't care about this Anna at all! But I suppose he's going to start now. Anonymous threats... way to slander him! Thank you for telling me. I'll strangle this Anna myself, the viper! With my own hands!"
540579, "But who could be sending her those letters? They're signed, 'Look Back'."
540580, "What did you say? 'Look Back'? I think I'm beginning to see now... Anna must have really been involved with the Caravan... which makes Khan the most likely writer of the letters. So that's why they all suddenly assembled at the Polyhedron five days ago and wouldn't leave. They had heard of the seeds of the Caravan sprouting in the town. Small wonder..."
540581, "I don't get it... Who assembled at the Polyhedron?"
540582, "Really though, what was the point of the whole plan? They probably had something else in mind too?"
540583, "No. Nothing. They travelled the country... acting, singing, performing stunts and tricks. They took bright children and left ugly ones on doorsteps as replacements. Like changelings... They were leaving fear, grief, hatred, and monsters in their wake-while themselves becoming ever more alluring, beautiful, attractive, and memorable. But despite that, people were growing more and more afraid of them."
540584, "But that's a very clear picture of an imaginary evil... An evil that really only pretends to be evil."
540585, "What is real evil then?"
540586, "Nothingness. The absence of feeling and colour. If a Caravan like that never existed, that would be the real evil."
540587, "You'll soon get a practical demonstration. You'll see for yourself..."
540588, "That's horrible... There's so much hatred around! Was the Caravan destroyed?"
540589, "Yes. It attracted the attention of the Powers That Be fairly quickly. There was a real manhunt for them; they conducted raids and searches, they chased them... At first the Caravan miraculously managed to elude them, but eventually they were surrounded somewhere near Orv... A ballad was written about that attack. You've probably heard it."
540590, "No, I don't remember hearing it..."
540591, "...But who could have defeated that evil if it had been real and not of the buffoonish kind? No one. And the Caravan would've made it as far as your Steppe by now."
540592, "...And the Kains know about Anna's connection to the Caravan?"
540593, "Well, it hasn't been proved yet. But the day they find out will be the last day of her life, I have no doubt about it. The Caravan is a bogeyman that the Kains hate with a passion. A punishment by the government would be a walk in the park compared to the scourges that the Kains used to call down upon them."
540594, "Could it be that the Kains have found out about Anna and are threatening her now?"
540595, "If it is so, then it can only be one particular Kain: the weakest and temporarily paralysed one. The others wouldn't stoop to threats; they'd act right away."
540596, "Who is it then?"
540597, "Kaspar, also known as Khan. Victor and Nina's son, and black-eyed Maria's little brother. My sister will tell you all about him-they were friends for a while. At one point, our parents even considered arranging their marriage, despite the age difference... But they were too incompatible."
540600, "Thanks for your advice. I'll talk to your sister."
540601, "Well... thank you, Vladislav. Now let's see what your sister thinks about it."
540602, "Yes... You do sound like you know what you're talking about... Who are you, Clara? Answer me!"
540603, "I've noticed that a lot of people here are scared of me. It's probably a trial I have to withstand..."
540604, "Why do I feel we have something in common, something important that's hard to miss... As if we were siblings... But what is it?"
540605, "Then tell me, what is your purpose in life?"
540606, "I already have a sister, and it's not you."
540607, "I'd like to give the children a new life... and a new faith."
540608, "Indeed? Then you must be the holy one? Then you too are a prophetess and a harbinger? And you're saying that you're going to gather a congregation and give them the light of a new truth? What truth will it be? Tell me, girl with eyes out of which a dead woman is looking at me already!"
540609, "I'm not saying I want to start a new church... I must have phrased it badly. You simply don't understand how good my intentions are..."
540610, "I know, sister... Don't be alarmed by the things I say. It's just that what you're talking about is too dangerous. It's not to be toyed with. Even if you're just children..."
540611, "You may be one of those to whom I've been sent as a harbinger."
540612, "And why had the news of Caravan fugitives frightened the children so much?"
540613, "What is the Caravan? "
540614, "It's that circus of wandering murderers. The one where singers were abducting children... and doing horrible things to them. It was an enormous circus troupe doubling as a cult of some sort. A mysterious story that's still unclear on many points. The reprisal was too hasty, and the investigation too muddled. They had frightened everyone too much."
540615, "Frightened how?"
540617, "Basically, they used to abduct children. It is said they brought them up as actors, in order to attract new audiences... They picked the best. But now, so many years later, there have been so many legends, so many ballads and scary stories about them that no-one remembers the truth anymore. In the children's ears, the word 'Caravan' is simply synonymous with a maddening and inescapable horror."
540618, "But it's only Anna, and she's alone..."
540619, "Khan will give her no peace regardless. In his mind, even a single living Caravan actor is a being who will sow and spread the seeds of this senseless monstrosity... like an infection of sorts."
540620, "By the way, Anna has an accomplice: the hunchback usurer!"
540621, "Stakh, I'm not an informer... How could you think something like that of me? I myself, who's yet to do anything except good and kindly things to people, am being hunted and scrutinized inside out-like some epitome of evil!"
540625, "I don't need your vaccines, Rubin. I sense something scary in them... Besides, I don't think there'll be enough for everybody..."
540626, "You just try to inform on me! I'll tear you to shreds! I'll grab you by your ankles with my one hand and by your wrists with the other and... Got just enough arm span for that!"

540637, "I know everything, Stakh Rubin. Tell me where Simon is. At first I even thought you might be him... You mountain of a man... You impossible man!"
540638, "That's true. But Simon's body has been stolen. Do you understand? He's not where I examined him anymore."
540639, "Anna Angel did. She advised me to tip the Kains off about you and the Bachelor."
540640, "Anna Angel is a crazy neurotic, with nothing inside and nothing of her own on the outside: a salad of haphazard imitations and borrowing. This rumour-mongering of hers is a typical example. Any more questions?"
540641, "Look, I do believe you. But suppose Anna tells somebody else? She told me to go and check-when she could've just as easily written a letter to the Kains..."
540642, "What kind of vials?"
540643, "A... special kind. Vaccines. I'm going to make a few hundred and give them to Isidor's apprentices to distribute to the people so that no-one gets ill. If the Termitary is re-opened, they'll deliver them to the Kin. If it isn't, they'll give it to the people. To everyone. So that there's enough for all."
540644, "True... except for the false part.  Is that how you always lie, Roubin? Don't do it, you're rather bad at it. Childishly bad..."
540645, "Don't hide from me. I mean no harm to anybody. There's no act that I couldn't understand, explain, and forgive..."
540646, "All right... I'll tell you. Yes, it was I who stole the body. The Bachelor knows nothing. And the reason I stole it, Clara, was that I wished to carry through with my duty. I'm a doctor, I've sworn the oath... and not only the same oath everyone swears, but also a special one... to my Master."
540647, "So why did you steal Simon's body?"
540648, "My Master was a Menkhu... who had renounced his lawful power entirely for the sake of the Kin's prosperity... He dedicated all his efforts to medicine, instead of the art of bull-drawing or the science of government. He probably knew or sensed something. And so, were it not for his vile murder, he would now be doing everything in order for the Kin to live on."
540649, "And it's probably more important than that other one, right?"
540650, "And that's why you stole Simon?"
540651, "Simon was more than a mere human. He had transfigured his entire essence in such a way that every particle of his being would align with the law of universal harmony. Simon had fashioned himself after Bos Turokh-so they said at the Kin, meaning that for them, he had become divine."
540652, "Who is Bos Turokh?"
540653, "The World Bull. He out of whom the Universe was made. Everything that happens to this being, all of its vital processes, all of its shapes, are signs and semblances reflecting all that was, is, or will be in this world. All creatures carry that knowledge within-but the Universal Bull and its semblances embody it fully!"
540654, "This is heresy, Rubin. This is so not how the Universe was created!"
540655, "I'm beginning to understand you now... So two days were not enough to complete your study of this... Bos Turokh transfiguree?"
540656, "Not nearly enough. He really is different from other people. And I've seen a lot of those. Many different creatures have revealed their nature under my scalpel. So what are you intending to do?"
540657, "I've found out everything I wanted to know. I'm leaving."
540658, "You know that already. Why ask?"
540659, "Yes. You've understood what I'm talking about. Goodbye, Rubin. Prepare yourself for a formidable test."
540660, "I'm a Kshatriya, not a Brahmin."
540661, "I feel there's still a lot we need to talk about... You are blasphemously doing what can only be performed by one invested with a special right to power."
540662, "This is what the people of the Steppe believe. And I'm telling you that Simon... is more than a man. I'll go on working on him for a long time yet. And Victor and Georgiy aren't going to stop me!"
540663, "Aren't you a little too sure of that? Do you have a lot of places left to hide? I wonder how they haven't found you yet..."
540664, "You are wicked, Burakh... And scary. You know, you and the Bachelor really are... inhuman. What with all this spite emanating from you... And I feel that there's an enormous and evil creature controlling you both with its hands!"
540665, "I've just been thinking about the feeling you give me-and there you go! No better way to describe it. Some call you a saint-but to me, you look like the exact opposite. It's said that all tempters assume the guise of holiness!"
540666, "Well... I've come to tell you that you must leave. There's a manhunt underway for the Ripper. It's led by the Bachelor."
540667, "Stay where you are, demon! I don't know if I'll be able to kill you today-but you will lose a lot of blood. You are mortal too, I know it... however hard to kill you may prove!"
540668, "Wasn't it you who stole Simon's body? You certainly didn't do it in order to bury him. You're holding a freshly sharpened scalpel!"
540669, "...I never touched Simon-in fact, I never even met him. But if you tell the Bachelor that I've stolen his body and that I'm here, I'll be in a lot of trouble. A patrol will be dispatched here at once, and my mission will end in failure."
540670, "Stop... You have no idea..."
540671, "Every time you show up at The Crucible, be prepared to suffer! These walls will burn the very thing within you that allows you to do your wicked work. Call it magic, if you will, or call it supreme justice."
540672, "...And how are you going to drive me out, old man? Will you draw a circle around yourself, or cover the walls with arcane signs? Aren't you afraid that will summon a demon scarier still?"
540673, "I just wanted to..."
540674, "All the suffering you will have gone through here will seem like gentle caresses compared to the torture you will endure if Maria touches you-not even with her gaze, but with thought alone, a mere recollection of you! Be warned, heiress of the earth! Now begone!"
540675, "Ouch! It burns! What is this? What is this?"
540676, "Ouch! You'll regret this, impudent old man! Your sorcery won't save any of you from retribution!"
540677, "I am a harbinger."
540678, "It won't help."
540679, "You don't have to worry about that. Rest assured you will do something for me. In fact, you are doing something for me already, even if inadvertently. Believe it or not, but the pleasure brought by your visit feels startlingly physical for the kind of purely intellectual stimulus it actually is."
540680, "...Is this something that you expected?"
540681, "Shame on you, Yulia! You're making me blush..."
540682, "'Expected!' An apt observation indeed! Bear with me, please; I am still young, and whatever acumen I've had the time to acquire is clearly not enough to suppress the excitement one feels when everything happens just the way it was expected to happen. Oh, the joy I feel when everything falls well in line with what I have predicted-by which I don't mean the brute probabilism your mother would resort to, but a watertight, well-grounded calculation of likelihood! You check your notes... you make minuscule adjustments... and then-bang! You see your assumptions gain flesh at your own doorstep."
540683, "I'm happy that you've been expecting me. However silly it might be to be happy about it."
540684, "I suppose you worked out on paper what I should look like too, didn't you?"
540685, "Frankly, I imagined you as a completely different person. Tall as a lamp post; white; ragged... with your ribs bare, and a firm, shapely bosom. Long hair, off-white and disheveled of course... and a pair of huge, puffy peepers."
540686, "That's the image of a saint. It's what they would look like a thousand years ago..."
540687, "Nice. Was I by any chance carrying a long, rapaciously curved scythe?"
540688, "Right. Enough silliness. Let us get to the meat of the matter. You know... I am dying to know what your request may be. I'd even venture an educated guess that you wanted to ask me something about Eva Yan? But what could it be? Anyone could have told you the basic facts; who she is, where she lives, what she prefers to wear... Are you interested in something else then; something concerning her soul? Is this the case?"
540689, "But how would you... Who told you? Did you speak with Katerina? Is this some kind of a joke?"
540690, "Alas, no, Yulia. I wanted nothing of the sort. You can roll cigarettes from your scribbled calculations. I don't fit into your constructs!"
540691, "Oh no, I didn't speak with Katerina; I never do. Morphine addicts and other kinds of substance abusers are not the company I normally prefer. They make too bleak an impression. I have ceased my relationship with the Stamatin twins for that very reason. Now these two are of potential interest to you. Did you meet them yet?"
540692, "How did you know I was going to ask you about Eva?"
540693, "Tell me more about the Cathedral! Why is it so empty?"
540694, "Why... it is empty because it was built before the religion was allowed to reach maturity. Even an atheist like me knows what a cathedral is for. They are not-as Peter Stamatin would have it-'a set of walls covered by a roof'. Rather than that, they're vessels of the numinous; miracle incubators, if you will. The issue, in our particular case, is that we have the Tower on the other side of the river to serve this very purpose..."
540695, "Is Eva in love with the Bachelor? He is a demon."
540696, "Your atheism is groundless... I think you'll soon change your views."
540697, "Why are you looking at me like that?"
540698, "I am going to keep looking at you, or rather to keep watching you. I get the feeling that every move you make may be reliably predicted. This is not an opportunity I would ever miss, for it feeds remarkably well into one of my theories... perhaps, the most pessimistic of them all. Well, off you go... harbinger."
540699, "I understand now. Goodbye."
540700, "I'm brave! I'm not afraid of you!"
540701, "That is ill-advised. The moment I decide that I want to fight you, you will drop dead. I merely don't want to begin before the time is ripe."
540702, "You can begin right now. If you dare."
540703, "You're mistaking me for someone else... As I have come, so I will go... And right now I only want peace..."
540704, "Destroying you, a Mistress of the Earth in the making, would take too much of my power... After you collapse with a ruptured heart, I will be lethargic for over a year. And right now I need that power like never before."
540705, "No... No! Don't look at me like that!"
540706, "Why? To charm the Bachelor?"
540707, "...Lethargic? Did you say lethargic?"
540708, "You ought to know that in a matter of a few days my power will grow to its fullness, and I will reclaim all of the scintillae of magic now scattered across the Memory of my dear mother. Run away from here. As soon as I become a Mistress, this plague will be over-no matter who sent it upon us. There will be no place for you here."
540709, "It's for these words that you will pay... And not you alone! Now I see how right my dear mother Katerina is..."
540710, "I will stay here."
540711, "I'm telling you, I'm good, not evil! Why can't any of you see that?"
540712, "I need to talk to Mark, but in private! Without you."
540713, "See, Mark? Shall we give her a chance perhaps? It'll be a lot of fun. So what was it you were hoping to tell Mark? Could it be the same thing you told my uncle Georgiy the other day? Actually, I'm beginning to get angry... I should be angry now but this is just too amusing..."
540714, "There will be nothing amusing about that, Maria Kaina. Oh, how I hate you! Goodbye! "
540715, "So I've been saved by my sheer lack of artifice?"
540716, "Of course, Clara. Surely you didn't think those tricks would work on us. Or is there really something you're missing? Could I be the naïve one, and you the saint? Let's see... No... not even remotely. You do feel I can break you with a mere effort of my will, don't you?"
540717, "Nothing... I've walked into the wrong door!"
540718, "I'm just testing you. So far in our encounters, you've been the bigger loser!"
540719, "You cannot possibly have important news for me. You cannot possibly know something I do not."
540720, "Capella has had a bad dream about a tragedy striking at the Cathedral. Very soon, perhaps as we speak. Have you had the same dream?"
540723, "It also concerns the demon you worship so much-I mean the Bachelor. After all, it was he who occupied and defiled the town's Cathedral!"
540724, "How exactly did he defile it? Perhaps by sheltering sufferers in it? Why, it's only because of him that the Cathedral has at least partly begun to serve its divine purpose! Its routine has changed-but only to bring it back to the intended roots; how can a Changeling like you not feel it? What fool has called you a saint?"
540725, "Pull yourself together. Capella has had a dream in which tragedy struck at the Cathedral. Everyone inside was dead! It's worth checking!"
540726, "You'll remember my words tomorrow! I had a dream once..."
540727, "You could not possibly have had any dreams. Don't lie to me. If you actually had that nonexistent sister, she could be the one having prophetic dreams. Not you."
540728, "You don't even have to... you probably know everything anyway, don't you?"
540729, "All right... Capella has had a dream in which the infection found its way into the Cathedral and killed everyone inside!"
540730, "Alive, you say? It would've been a good idea to listen when the bells were ringing..."
540731, "Yikes! No! I'm afraid! Suppose I walk in and there are dead people in there. And I'll get blamed afterwards..."
540734, "Don't be afraid. The Cathedral is well-guarded. Here, take some money and give it to the guards. They'll open the doors and you will check together... You will have witnesses..."
540735, "That could work... Either way, I won't go past the door."
540736, "Give me your hands, let me touch you... And you, and you, and you too... There, there, no need to be afraid... Nothing more will happen..."
540737, "Look into my eyes. What have you got here? Can I touch?"
540738, "Must be some dirt in my eye, I'm sorry... Or maybe a piece of clay... I need to rub my eyes... Where are you?"
540739, "You don't see me, watchful guard. And my voice is your own fancy. It's coming from within..."
540740, "Who knows?"
540741, "There'd be none to see in any case... They say it strikes at once. One faints before one can take three steps. Only someone special-someone like Burakh, Simon, or a Bound person-can withstand the sickness for a long time... "
540742, "Are you at ease now?"
540743, "I have..."
540744, "Did she abuse you? Or was she kind? You didn't mention my name, did you?"
540745, "She almost killed me! Every time I'm at the Crucible, the Kains use some kind of destructive magnetism against me!"
540746, "I'm so sorry... Can I do anything to reward you for what you've had to suffer through?"
540747, "I'd prefer never to see her again..."
540748, "No. I should even say it was an enlightening visit. And I'm most content with how it turned out."
540749, "Drop a word for me... At least to your friends, the children."
540750, "I can guess. Are you and I really Mistresses, though? Can you really say something like that to me? Why joke like that?"
540751, "I had a dreadful dream last night. I saw a sinister creature come in the dark of night-a thing of the Steppe, a shabnak-adyr. She sneaked into the Cathedral and killed everyone, everyone who was hiding in there! All around, I saw the dead-the dead-the dead!"
540752, "How can I help you?"
540753, "I do not know if I should trust that dream... Maybe it was no vision-I'm not used to having those yet, and cannot tell a dream from a Dream... And the children wouldn't stop talking about the shabnak-adyr to me. They've been told all those scary things..."
540754, "No, Capella dear. I don't know that yet."
540755, "Well... it makes sense. Can't an infected person get inside? "
540756, "The probability is very small. But the Bachelor is the one who estimates the time since infection, for his own bigoted reasons. He has some diabolical term for it, 'the latent stage'... Something he needs to put in his reports to the capital..."
540757, "Should we really be afraid of your dream then?"
540758, "I'd rather ask Katerina."
540759, "Forgive me, Clara dear, I know she is your mother now-but Katerina is wrong too often. You can ask her if you wish, but I know that her visions are often distorted. The theme is right but the details are twisted. And the demon is in the details this time."
540760, "I feel sick every time I'm at the Crucible... Maria is going to kill me."
540761, "If the dream is prophetic, it will destroy her Bachelor. An envoy from the capital is arriving the day after tomorrow, and everything will depend on them. Maria will never go as far as to put her Bachelor's success at risk. And I'll reward you!"
540762, "But why don't you want to write her a letter?"
540763, "Why are you calling the two of you Mistresses anyway? I don't know about Maria, but you-how are you a Mistress? "
540764, "I'm still only a girl. But that will change... Try it regardless! The Kains don't think that bad of you. They always try to be intimidating, they like to dramatize everything, they enjoy striking up a pose! My dear... I'll reward you just for asking the question! If only you ask it on your own behalf! Please!"
540765, "But what about me?"
540766, "Simon is not dead."
540767, "I just wanted to take a glimpse at your workspace... That's really impressive."
540768, "What would you need the keys to the Catheral for?"
540769, "Maria told me you had them..."
540770, "What, you and Maria talk to each other? Unbelievable. Maria denounced you as a Changeling and said that if you came to her again, she'd have you thrown into the Gorkhon to see if you'd sink or swim. Does this mean you've swum?"
540771, "No!"
540772, "I'd like to see if everything's all right in there. I have a suspicion that something bad might happen inside."
540773, "Everything's all right. The Cathedral is well guarded. No new infections have been reported in the last twenty-four hours. Anything else?"
540774, "I'll only have a quick look..."
540775, "You monster! You're keeping them there in such conditions? It's like a death camp!"
540776, "Quit fooling around! Let me into the Cathedral."
540777, "So you sank? That makes you a non-witch; but then you must be a revenant, and I don't know which is worse. Shame that the bullets in my revolver are leaden and not silver. But perhaps they'll do too..."
540778, "Bachelor, give me the key... Why don't any of you believe me? Why am I the only one you're ever suspicious of?"
540779, "I'm leaving! I don't need anything! Just don't shoot me..."
540780, "It's firm, mother."
540781, "Do you remember everything I have told you about those Bound of yours who are infected with a utopian heresy-and about some of them... or perhaps many of them being instrumental in bringing the wrath of heaven upon our town?"
540782, "It must be so, mother."
540783, "There is a mansion in the Stone Yard called The Stillwater. Living there is a girl named Eva Yan. Both good and bad things are said about her; she is said to be affectionate and depraved, a kind soul while also voluptuous... but I am not talking about that. Lust is not the kind of sin to incur such a punishment."
540784, "Why are you talking about her then?"
540785, "Eva has been led astray by utopian ideas. What has particularly captured my attention is that Eva, the gentle Eva Yan, is spending an extraordinary amount of time at-the town's Cathedral. There is no knowing as to what is drawing her there... but her way of life is incongruous with such a piety. It is mysterious..."
540786, "I'll try to solve it, mother."
540787, "Eve is gentle and weak... Begin with her. She is unlikely to be rude with you. Try to use your powers on her first... for from then on, you will commune with some dangerous and... difficult collocutors. They may overwhelm you with their rage... rendering you unable to sway them."
540788, "Go to sleep, mother dear. Sleep and lay all your worries aside..."
540789, "I know, mother."
540790, "Remember what I told you about Yulia. She is intelligent... very intelligent. Be careful with her too... I don't know her very well but she seems like a worthy woman. And very fond of Eva..."
540791, "I'm afraid of the disease. It's here already, standing by our windows..."
540792, "I haven't met that kind of people yet..."
540793, "I can't even imagine how I ought to talk to a girl like that. They scare me-these depraved ones..."
540794, "Well... I was hoping to have some rest here too."
540795, "Fine. I'm leaving."
540796, "All right, I'll come by later."
540797, "Quinine can help... if you don't have anything better."
540798, "I'm just going to rest here a little..."
540799, "Yes, I'm just popping back for a moment... Is there a mirror anywhere I could look into?"
540800, "Stop worrying about that! Can you really think of nothing else now?"
540801, "I have brought the relics to her. Here they are. "
540802, "You cannot go in now. If you do have them, better bring them back to Nina. She remains the Scarlet Mistress for now."
540803, "I am. I've forbidden it."
540804, "Can you even imagine what's going on there?"
540805, "It appears that she's ignored that prohibition."
540806, "Maria doesn't listen to me anymore. There's not that much left of me anyway... Perhaps something will change when her mother comes back."
540807, "What's her buisness in town?"
540808, "The streets are dangerous as hell. And you are so indifferent?"
540809, "And they said Lilich had restored order in the streets with an iron fist... Is it true that they've erected a gallows near the railway?"
540810, "I haven't seen it. They did light fires though."
540811, "Thank you, I'll intercept her there. And, as a punishment for her wayward behaviour, I'll arrange for her a meeting with a certain family member."
540812, "I am, Grace... And I'm fond of you too."
540813, "Grace, oh Grace, I know of you this: you sing merry songs to the dead when the nights are cold and murmur lullabies for them on warm nights..."
540814, "...Don't. I'm going to tell you everything anyway. Why are you doing this? Do you think we're strangers?"
540815, "Very... very much so."
540816, "Why?"
540817, "Because there's no escaping it now... And it's been coming to us from the Steppe... Getting closer...  Step by step... The dead felt her coming... She pierced the earth with her sharp-boned stilts... Which reached them underground... No one will be spared..."
540818, "Do you know why it happened?"
540819, "All right, I'm sorry... So you believe that I'm the harbinger of good?"
540820, "...Will you brave the depths? Will you answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
540821, "Yes... I will."
540822, "Are you afraid, Grace?"
540823, "What's going to happen to us, Grace?"
540824, "There will soon be a plague."
540825, "Why is this happening to us?"
540826, "Who are you, Grace?"
540827, "I'm Grace... My father was the caretaker of this cemetery... He poured milk and twyrine over the graves... My mother swept the gravestones with her hair... They taught me to listen to the dead."
540828, "What will become of us, Grace?"
540829, "I doubt that, Grace. The faith of humility is a faith for the doomed. Whoever is resigned to death deserves to die. Don't think this reckoning is inevitable."
540830, "...Perhaps with good deeds, love, and a serene mind this scythe of death can be escaped?"
540831, "I'll stop by later."
540832, "Do you pull people's souls out with these hooks? Why else would you need so many different ones?"
540833, "Yes, Grace. They're special hooks."
540834, "You can see them? Whoa. You're weird..."
540835, "She's affectionate, kind, and defenseless."
540836, "Have you managed to convince her?"
540837, "Her face is fair, yet her thoughts are poisoned and dark."
540838, "No, I didn't. She's in love... and I don't think her kind of impudence is what could bring the wrath upon the entire town."
540839, "...But it would have been so easy. What is the matter with you, my daughter? Had you at least told me that she threw you out, that you weren't been able to convince her, that a frantic Bachelor stormed into the house and scared you off, flimsy thing that you are... I would not have been angry. But you say that you gave up on her of your own volition!"
540840, "Why, I don't hear any tinkling... You speak strangely..."
540841, "Eva, oh Eva, I know of you this: you love the Bachelor more than your own life. Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
540842, "Get away from me, wretch! Cover your ears with your hands and run! I am your death!"
540843, "What? What's wrong with you? Go away, please go, don't touch me..."
540844, "What have I done... I just couldn't help saying it..."
540845, "I'm not sure you're right, mother... Could it be you're mistaken?"
540846, "I know whereof I speak, sweet daughter... The voice that talks to me in my dreams is incapable of lying... For many years, this has been how my visions come to me... Let other Mistresses say that isn't genuine... I know... My visions have at times proved truer than theirs..."
540847, "Who do you want me to convert today?"
540848, "How am I to speak to him? I don't know any of his secrets."
540849, "It won't be the way it was yesterday... more like the day before yesterday, perhaps... perhaps he is with us already... perhaps he is himself preparing the utopians... albeit in his own way... and you, find out... what he is up to..."
540850, "Why did you choose Mark of all people? I don't think my words could sway someone like that."
540851, "Did you say he's a theatre director? Could he by any chance have connections with the Caravan?"
540852, "He's been living here for a long time... I don't remember... don't know... but he's never taken an interest in children... wouldn't even notice them... even banned them from attending his performances... No, it's not that..."
540853, "So he's not that wicked? But then what do you need him for?"
540854, "I'll do what you've told me to. I'll tell him what you said; it won't be difficult."
540855, "And so? Pray tell, don't keep me waiting..."
540856, "Do you trust my insight? Do you know that I can read people's souls?"
540857, "Would I entrust you with such things if I didn't? Would I let you rewrite and redraw people's destinies if I didn't trust you, my angel?"
540858, "He's not one to side with either the Utopians or the Humble. He stands apart."
540859, "Maria thinks he's under her charms and in the ranks of the utopians. He's playing along. But that's not how it really is!"
540860, "I think Mark just wanted to scare you. He's against us, mother... We don't need him... he's wicked. Let him subvert the utopians instead!"
540861, "I'm frightened... You sound as if I'd have to kill them!"
540863, "Yes... yes, mother!"
540864, "We must continue! There are not many Bound left... Our town will not be spared for the sake of ten righteous men-nay, it will be destroyed on account of a single rebel... As of now, we are losing the battle... and for all I know, my husband may be exterminating the truly faithful in his fury..."
540865, "That's very likely! Everyone who he turns my attention to, seem to acknowledge fully that they deserve to be punished!"
540866, "I need to think about it some more... For now, let us continue to act..."
540867, "...How?"
540868, "Who are you going to send me to, mother?"
540869, "The blade of your words will now be pointed at the very heart... of the utopians' false doctrine. Only the Kains themselves are more dangerous than them... I am talking about the brothers Stamatin-the rebellious architects who have challenged... too many things. You will begin with Peter. Convert him."
540870, " What happened at the Cathedral?"
540871, "A disease carrier got into the Cathedral last night. Everyone inside perished. Yes, yes, making it past your impregnable quarantine. Human or spirit, it's very clear now that this is an individual who can walk, and is probably quite malicious. Many people are revelling in this particular certainty.  "
540872, "What does Olgimsky have to do with this?"
540874, "Quite so. The bacterium has been caught and encased in glass. I didn't do it on my own, though. I had help."
540875, "This is a witch hunt in the making. As if dimwitted blackguards murdering women in the streets wasn't enough-it seems that our governor is now inclined to extend his greedy reach towards the town's notable people. Several young women stand accused after the Cathedral business."
540876, "More importantly, they say that you are now able to track down the shapeshifting disease carrier, сomparing their blood to that sample you obtained yesterday. If they are one of the townsfolk, it can't be that hard to recognize them. "
540877, "Also true."
540878, "All these rumours are not groundless..."
540879, "Why are you telling me this?"
540881, "Is there anything I can do?"
540882, "Check on them-now that you have the capability. Hurry, before your discovery breeds baseless speculations. One would want to save innocent lives. Or else... nothing can be certain in a situation like this."
540883, "And you? Can you do anything?"
540884, "I don't know the rules of chess..."
540885, "How do I hook him?"
540886, "...Do you believe that too?"
540887, "Think about Peter... Throwing that weight off our enemies' side of the scale will give us more breathing room. Perhaps the plague will stop..."
540888, "How can I gain his trust?"
540889, "Hmm... It all hinges on Maria again... Maria and Nina... yes, that is too strong a citadel... only a miracle could help you."
540890, "Is Peter in love with Maria?"
540891, "...What?"
540892, "And then I'll drink with you. So what do you think? Will you answer? "
540893, "How did you manage to do that, Peter?"
540894, "Wait! ...Why are you asking me? I can see you taking me by the hand, leading me here... a circle of light from a bright lamp.. Stop! I sought oblivion in the green fairy's embrace... I desired you, so that you could give me a chance to forget... and you're reminding me again? You're lying! Who are you?"
540895, "What's wrong with you? Haven't you seen me before?"
540896, "You're all but dead, Peter! Do you understand what this daydream of yours means?"
540897, "I don't know... I'll do what Andrey says... Bring my brother to me... Where are you, brother? You're the only one I trust... I'm surrounded by ghosts, by translucent greenness... maras and chimeras... the double-faced Changeling... only he is real, my support, my bulwark..."
540898, "I'm going to have to take your twyrine away. You're at death's door already."
540899, "Do you realize why it happened?"
540900, "I'm Clara. The harbinger. I've come for you!"
540901, "Why am I double-faced?"
540902, "Look, there are two of you... oh, chimeras, chimeras, monsters... One's hanging from the lamp hook on the ceiling, lighting up the place; your green lips smiling, whispering something... The other one-there she is, laughing at me, crouching in the far corner... dissolving into pond weed..."
540903, "Wait! I'll bring you back to life..."
540904, "Had you been alive, Peter, you'd have converted. But you're dead already."
540905, "...Really? Why? I think I'm quite alive..."
540906, "Look, my sister and I are twins too. But one of us is here, on this inner side of Existence, and the other's on its outer side. We are one, but I'll never take her by the hand. Convert, Peter."
540907, "Why? Death... I'm terrified of death. Of true death... this here is just a game for now. It's not real yet, is it?"
540908, "There's nothing terrifying about death... Not for you at this point, anyway... The void of oblivion is what's terrible... Convert."
540909, "You speak too simply and too fast... But you scare me nonetheless... No, I'd prefer a painful death... The vivid death of a martyr burned at the stake... I couldn't bear oblivion... I won't accept it."
540910, "Convert. Here, I'm turning around and leaving. I'm the angel of your death. Make your choice while you still have time. You've summoned me, and here I am-here to comfort you."
540911, "I've come for you. But you won't heed me... Farewell."
540912, "Wait... I'm going..."
540913, "Go. My sister, the paraclete, will be waiting for you there... outside."
540914, "Is this life though? You seek death yourself!"
540915, "Yes, it isn't. But that's just for now. Reconsider, Peter. Come back."
540916, "Come back to me."
540917, "What? What do you mean, in danger? Now you've truly grabbed my attention! What's happened to him? Let's go, you'll tell me all about it along the way..."
540918, "Your brother holds heretic views..."
540919, "Andrey, oh Andrey, I know of you this: you're in love with Maria..."
540920, "Nonsense! I'm not in love with Maria. I do admire her-that goes without saying-but I only love one person in the world, and that's my brother. So cut the crud and tell me what's threatening him!"
540921, "Andrey, I fear that this pestilence has been sent down upon him-personally."
540922, "Forget it, Andrey! Let's pretend we never had this conversation, all right?"
540923, "A miracle, you say? ...No, I wouldn't throw that man out. Goodbye, Andrey. Forgive me for being so faint-hearted."
540924, "But..."
540925, "So you're saying we have incurred wrath from above with our impudence? Liar! Double, triple liar! I don't know what God you believe in, but I don't think you're even old enough to have a concept of one! And you are either a lying impostor-or an abominable Changeling, a temptress, a thing from hell, a shabnak-adyr, a maneater, made of dead bones and dirty clay!"
540926, "Don't yell at me, don't call me... that! I'm leaving... I'm leaving!"
540927, "Oh but yes, precisely!"
540928, "And here's what I'll tell you: only a godless apostate and devil-worshipper, which is what you Saburovs are, could dare deny the greatness of God's design! It is nothing like that tower built out of an ambition to topple heaven. It's a different world, you idiot! This tower was not built for the sake of faith or of faithlessness. It's something else entirely!"
540929, "What's the tower got to do with it?"
540930, "I will not betray my brother's creation, and I will not let you tarnish his name! Get lost! Go to hell. Go back to the earth you came from!"
540931, "No, I don't dare do anything of the sort... Who am I to talk like that... Goodbye, Andrey!"
540932, "There is only one world. You've been living without faith before-so I'm here to give you a jolt!"
540933, "All right. I'll think about it... Perhaps I even won't go back to him at all."
540934, "It’s written all over your face. But let’s get right down to business, seeing as you have very little time; the walls of this house are pernicious to you, little imp. What is it, then, that’s causing your displeasure with me or, say, with the most charming Mistress of... this hospitable house?"
540935, "Mark Immortell, I accuse you of heresy and blasphemy. You were the one that brought down the plague upon the town!"
540936, "Now those are some strong words! You're much too impressionable, my child. Katerina's only dabbling in prophetic rhetoric because it's her last resort, now that she's foreseen the beginning of the end... An ugly trick to pull, and cheap too... take a professional's word for it."
540937, "What, are you a priest?"
540938, "What? What did you call me?"
540939, "That was affectionate. I could take my words back though. Admittedly you don't quite fit the definition yet... but you're almost there... although there's still some hope left. Perhaps a miracle will happen and you'll turn away from that path."
540940, "You've challenged heaven. You're the reason for all that's happening now..."
540941, "Why all the twisted notions? Why are you so hateful? It's only play-acting, all of it! Like any game, play-acting is a mere shadow of Existence, a tiny fragment of it, a semblance-not a hollow semblance, mind you, quite the contrary, filled to the brim! Play-acting is fuller than reality... since it's smaller."
540942, "You're always play-acting! Always a mummer! That's why you have this manner of explaining things."
540943, "Yours is a world without faith..."
540944, "There's room for God inside the tiniest fragment..."
540945, "And who told you He's not present in here, Changeling?"
540946, "All I've seen here so far is the dead hollowness of puppetry!"
540947, "That explains a lot, doesn't it?"
540948, "It does to you, puppet master!"
540949, "Another toy semblance..."
540950, "It will lie to me too... How am I supposed to convince myself?"
540951, "And who are you?"
540952, "I've been posted here on the Bachelor's orders! I am an Executor, and I oversee the hospital. You are not allowed to go inside. Do you hear those horrendous screams? It's the agony of the incurable."
540953, "Where is the owner of the Theatre? Is he dead?"
540954, "Oh no... Tell me I don't have to go there again! Why is he so careless about choosing his friends?"
540955, "I see your mendacity with my own eyes now."
540956, "That's not true!"
540957, "I'm leaving-gotta lay low for a while. See you underground. And I'll always be glad to see you-you of all people should know I'm not at all as mendacious as my jealous detractors are making me look! You'll always be my welcome guest..."
540958, "It would seem that you're right... And what is your nature, prophet?"
540959, "All this time, none other but you have been the disease personified-the tool for the world to restore the balance with. All this time, there have been no sister. All this time, Clara has been chasing herself around, confounded by Katerina's visions becoming true."
540960, "I don't believe you... Prove that you're telling the truth!"
540961, "Oh, just rejoice, will you? Your actions have attracted the attention of the almighty Powers That Be. Do you know what they want from you? They'll send you a note today. Forget your silly little tricks; now your only chance to prove you are not the plague is to perform a genuine miracle."
540962, "You're lying. I've already performed many miracles."
540963, "Do you really trust me so much?"
540964, "And killed just as many people with your miraculous hands. No one knows what you are. No, you need a miracle on a grand scale. Something all-encompassing. Something to shape the world. Make it happen-and boom!-we'll believe you. And I'm not talking about those gnarly... angulous... freaks. Their pseudo-lives are of absolutely no importance."
540965, "It's all just a game for you! How dare you!"
540966, "In the end, you'll be surprised to find out that everything that you've heard, every single thing, was the honest truth-even the seemingly contradictory things."
540967, "So the Powers That Be will tell me what to do?"
540968, "Think twice before doing as they tell you, though. Those guys are a bunch of little liars."
540969, "It's all just a game for you! How dare you!"
540970, "It's all just a game for you! How dare you!"
540972, "Yulia! People love me... I've done them so much good... I've even been called a saint..."
540973, "You? A saint? What kind of an imbecile would call you that? Is there even a God that you believe in? You are a changeling, and your sainthood is the lamest kind of mimetic apery. You remind me of Anna Angel at times. She is utterly ludicrous, I grant you, a grimacing imp, if you will. You are a bit more serious than that."
540974, "What are you saying? What are you even talking about?"
540975, "I'm sure you have. I feel sorry for you, Aglaya Lilich..."
540976, "No. Fate can't be chosen, and this isn't about fate. It's you I'm worried about."
540992, "Well... You know everything about us already. Now that you've got this far, you're much more powerful than us..."
540993, "Who was Clara, the grave-born? The one who raised her hands first?"
541006, "And yet I still have to choose a reply from the options I'm offered."
541007, "The real game is what's happening between you and us. That was an official warning I had to make. I warned the previous charcaters too, but they went straight for questions... Such boring people."
541034, "I don't think I'll be able to ask a more interesting question..."
541036, "I know, he's a demon...  I can sense his otherworldly nature! Is there really no escaping him?"
541037, "My sister... Aren't you her? Aren't you the sister I spoke into existence?"
541038, "No... But I'll console you.. Your sister is here... she has talked to me a lot.. her and I are alike too, we are one... because she is you... don't be quick to condemn her... she too is dismayed, not knowing who she is... one of you will make her choice, and the other will follow."
541039, "It's all so complicated! I can't understand your allegories! But tell me, I'm the miracle-worker, aren't I-and not her?"
541040, "Who is my sister then? Am I not the Mistress of the Earth?"
541042, "No, no... Somehow I feel it's not what's going to happen to me! I don't want to get my own back on the Powers! I can sense how weak they are... I'm sorry for them."
541043, "Shut up and listen to me. Did they want miracles from you?"
541044, "Yes... Three days ago I received a letter..."
541046, "I don't think so!"
541047, "I don't know who I am either... It seems I'm a soul that's been put on trial before you... shortly before its impending death."
541048, "I didn't give myself that prerogative! Or are you already putting me on trial as a thief, to be hanged alongside robbers and looters?"
541049, "Alone? I'm not sure of that..."
541050, "I'll visit them to look into their eyes again. But I'll come back with my own verdict, same as back then! And you'll defer to it! That is what you've decided yourself..."
541051, "And I don't like cowards, liars, and traitors!"
541052, "It will fit you nicely, I know that for sure! But what do you need it for?"
541053, "I want to kill certain people who really deserve to die. But, being cowards, they're waiting for me. That's why I'd like to sneak up on them unnoticed."
541054, "No! I need nothing from you, demon."
541055, "What do you think this Inquisitor really wants? What's her objective here?"
541056, "...You've pierced me right to the heart! Is that really so?"
541057, "I've already spoken to him! It's you I want to listen to now..."
541058, "Save it then. Everything's in your hands now."
541059, "That's why I'm asking you..."
541060, "I've been inside. What is it? Who are you harbouring there?"
541061, "Much as I'd like to tell you that it's inhabited by my fantasies and my dreams, it would be untrue. Children live there: petty, pathetic, malicious, craving to imitate the grown-ups... But the place improves them, it makes them better, and that's why I don't object... Perhaps one day it will harbour someone's dream..."
541062, "What's so bad about the children's dreams?"
541063, "Take a look outside. That's what's bad about them... Every child is capable of crossing over to the other side of reality, but few are able to bring back something beautiful, good, and... magical. No, the Tower is not for children... It's for lovers, dreamers, and poets."
541064, "I believe you, Peter..."
541065, "Now I understand completely!"
541066, "You're mistaking me for someone else... just as you did back then."
541067, "Because he wants to leave it in a void, in icy solitude... like a unique butterfly preserved in formalin, pinned to the Steppe like to a piece of cardboard! No, I don't want that to happen! Who needs a victory like that..."
541068, "Don't despair, Andrey... You're making a mistake by not trusting me."
541069, "I will be able to change the Bachelor's mind."
541070, "Be quiet! You mistook me for a cat."
541071, "I don't have time for this. I'm leaving right now. Be off, I'm telling you! There is no time."
541072, "So rude..."
541073, "Wrong choice. And your loss..."
541074, "What are you talking about? It's ridiculous. I am here on my own business...You are not the center of the universe..."
541075, "Serves them right. Good people suffer no woe at my hand. Such is life... "
541077, "I need you to stay here for at least an hour. Two would be even better. And it would be best for you to stay put until you're paid a visit..."
541078, "Why?"
541079, "He is, Haruspex... But they can't strike you-so why would you need them if not to kill them?"
541080, "He's just as horrible a bloodsucker as you are-how could you both not surround yourselves with killers?"
541081, "And why would you warn me? You know full well there aren't many reasons for me to trust you... "
541082, "I'm warning you so that you have more. It's high time you realized not only evil walks this earth!"
541083, "Aglaya asked me to, Burakh... She's worried about you."
541084, "I see..."
541085, "I'll tell Aglaya where you are. She is looking for you... She'll send someone after you."
541086, "For I am the harbinger. Aren't you the one hunting my sister? So wait for her here. She will come to you..."
541087, "Well then. That's reason enough for me to stay here."
541088, "It's not about profit, Burakh, I have my own reasons... Give me as much as your soul tells you to."
541089, "Deal. Now tell me where the serpent is."
541090, "Everything that you have on your person, Haruspex. It must be a lot."
541091, "Those are tears, yes. I've been crying a lot lately. See what I have to do to placate the unbearable hatred you all harbour..."
541092, "You need the evil sister. And it's not me."
541093, "You are looking for the miracle-maker. It's not me. So do you want me to show you where she is?"
541094, "...Tell me where she is."
541095, "With a scalpel, as usual. But he's accompanied by his Kin slaves. They obey him now. Aspity provided him with an entourage!"
541096, "I've killed his companions. He is alone, you'll deal with him without a sweat."
541097, "Tell me where he is. I'm going after him this instant!"
541098, "Be careful, don't make a blunder. I'm rooting for you to win. Most importantly, don't you forget who pointed the direction to you."
541099, "How much money do you have on you? Do you think I went looking for you and risked my life for free?"
541100, "You'll be satisfied, Changeling. Nothing to worry about."
541101, "There's an ambush waiting for you by the exit-twenty or even thirty muggers. And you're alone, your henchmen are gone... I'll make them leave in two or three hours."
541102, "The one you're waiting for the most will come to you here... You know who I'm talking about, don’t you? I am her harbinger."
541103, "I'll stay put for some time. Don't you fret."
541104, "You mean death?"
541105, "You are a sharp man, Bachelor. I won't tell you more."
541106, "Me? You've never told me anything of the sort before. Have I really deserved it?"
541107, "Which ones?"
541108, "Those with nothing more to lose, I suppose. Such as myself."
541109, "What about other people? Can we call on them too? Or must it only be the Bound?"
541110, "Yes..."
541111, "I've staked everything on this military operation. My mission, my soul, my own destiny and our country's. I need a voice from above-because I don't know who to listen to anymore."
541112, "I didn't come here to answer riddles."
541113, "And what does that have to do with me?"
541114, "It's nothing to be thrilled about... Odd that they didn't just die."
541115, "I don't understand a thing...  I was told that Rubin had made some sort of a discovery concerning me."
541116, "Someone beat me to it! And you knew..."
541117, "...Who told you?"
541118, "...Filin, oh Filin, I know of you this: you knew ahead of time about the disaster that was to strike the town. Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
541119, "...Sure, kiddo, ask away... Where did you get my name, anyway? Did Saburov whisper it to you, the scum?"
541120, "You're... not asleep?"
541121, "Hey, is that magical? Show me... Why, what's the matter?"
541122, "...Gee, would you look at that! Hey villanous lot, you heard the lil' tot? You're not the Mistress of Earth by any chance, are you? Or an inquisitor on an official mission? Eh? Who d'you think you are, you wee lil' Saburov foundling? Lessee what colour your skin is on the inside... Get her!"
541123, "I know what colour yours is. Black, Grief... It's black."
541124, "Wha-? Hold on there folks, don't touch her just yet. What did you say? Black? And why is that?"
541125, "That's what I'm asking you; why is that?"
541126, "The Saburov scum is tryin' to frame me. Knife attacks 'n other kinds of nastiness. Now, can you imagine me cuttin' someone with a knife? Eh? Of course you can't! I'm not guilty of any of that and neither are my lads. Now Saburov, he's not angry on account of the people-just on account of his people... I want to give him the actual cutthroat so that he leaves me alone. I'll clear my own reputation in the process too, so it's a win-win!"
541127, "I'll put in a word for you."
541128, "Look at your own fellows standing there-you could run through three people with one of those knives they've got... Are they just a deterrent?"
541129, "Yep, they sure are, 'n I can prove it... 'Tis not they who carve people up, all right? Especially not Saburov's people..."
541130, "Go ahead. Prove it..."
541131, "There's nothing else I need..."
541166, "Clara's here... Hi, Clara! So-you're not a Changeling anymore?"
541225, "Some trifle! I have a whole nine of them, and I loathe most."
541260, "Right. I forgot."
541281, "Check me. Am I really the disease? "
541282, "No, not you... Oddly enough, I must say."
541283, "Then let me go."
541284, "That is exactly what's about to be ascertained. And you're the only one who can ascertain it. That's the essence of the sacrament. By establishing the present you will establish the past. With that which is yet to be done, you will establish that which has seemed to have been done beforehand. It has only worked the opposite way before."
541285, "Who are you?"
541286, "I do exist, sister, but in a transient way. For now, you are still the Disease, and I'm the persecuted saint. The problem is, there's no me yet; I'm a figment of your imagination... A consequence of a lie you told! And yet how wonderful that lie itself turned out to be... Theft had made a miracle possible..."
541287, "No... I don't understand. But it was your choice. Neither the Haruspex nor the Bachelor got one like that..."
541288, "Farewell, sister."
541289, "Did you hear what I said? I've taken up your burden. There will be a miracle. And you will have to go."
541290, "It couldn't have been any other way, my dear sister. Farewell. I'll take the disease with me as I leave. A lot of evil will be gone from this world along with me."
541291, "So now you're the holy miracle-worker?"
541292, "So it would seem, sister. Now that you've acknowledged yourself as an instrument of the Inevitability."
541293, "...And now you're leaving this world forever?"
541294, "I was never in it, dear sister. Don't forget, there's just been you all along."
541295, "I know. I'm talking to myself now."
541296, "My choice to be a miracle-worker was a part of their vicious plan too! The miracle had been preordained by them beforehand. They have defiled the nature of the miraculous."
541297, "So you think they've been laughing at us? You think they were sitting there rubbing their hands in anticipation, expecting us to perform a miracle while they knew that the inevitable necessity, which they themselves had created, would not win? You haven't understood a thing... and the truth of my words is confirmed by my still being here..."
541298, "Which is how you've overcome your hollowness!"
541299, "I don't understand..."
541300, "You rejected the stolen fate and became yourself. Well, I have nothing left to do but pick up what you've thrown away. It's my burden now. There's very little time left-but perhaps it will be enough for me... And you have no idea what's happening to me right now."
541301, "...And now you're leaving this world forever?"
541302, "I understand! I'm the one who'll leave soon, and you'll stay behind!"
541303, "So it shall be. Forgive me."
541304, "But is this doubt that I'm seeing in your eyes?"
541306, "Is the burden you've taken not too heavy for you?"
541307, "No. Don't ask again. You'll see for yourself soon enough."
541308, "Why are you asking?"
541309, "The plague was just a tool. Forget about the evil, and I'll carry it away. But have you understood correctly what the means will be to achieving the genuine miracle that is to take place here? It wasn't the banishing of the disease; that was a mere rehearsal... Do you realize what's being expected of you? Have you chosen rightly, Clara?"
541310, "You're the evil spirit now. Temptation, doubt, and equivocacy are your nature. Farewell. I don't wish to listen to you."
541311, "Oh no! You're making me doubt myself again..."
541312, "Yes. I'm ready now."
541313, "The Inquisitor insists that miracles and me are mutually exclusive."
541314, "I don't know... I haven't even thought about it. Aglaya doesn't tell the whole truth. From her point of view, there are no such things as miracles; that's just the way she was made. But we-we, not Simon!-are living proof of the contrary. You have a chance to preserve things as they are! You can do what others can't. They're impeded by enmities and hatred."
541315, "Who's enemies with whom, sister?"
541316, "The Inquisitor and the Commander. The Haruspex and the Bachelor. And then more conflict across these lines. All of them are bent on destroying what they detest. If you want to perform a miracle, remove the threat to each of the town's organs."
541317, "Now you're tempting me! Do you want me to kill?"
541320, "Is it true that I'm an instrument of the Law?"
541321, "There really is an envoy of the Law in this town, and it's one of the new arrivals. Is it perhaps the Bachelor or the Haruspex? It's evident that both of them are destroyers. Each of them has already accepted the inevitable. But could it be you? It would make things that much worse..."
541322, "How do we find out, then?"
541323, "We can't. We can only make it happen. How can I know something that hasn't been done yet? I'm not omnipotent."
541324, "Or aren't you?"
541325, "The Inquisitor is convinced of that!"
541326, "Are you the plague? Speak!"
541327, "What must I do?"
541328, "...I'm all enmities and hatred myself!"
541330, "But to preserve things as they are is the capricious wish of the criminal Powers That Be!"
541331, "You are free to choose your own fate. Now is your time to decide who you've been all along. It's only from the Law's perspective that you're the disease. But you don't recognize the Law. You're a thief. You'll escape the Law by stealing for yourself the path of a miracle-worker. You'll defeat it by performing a genuine miracle..."
541332, "If only..."
541333, "I still feel like I'm being deceived..."
541334, "Enough! Who am I? Speak!"
541335, "And you? What's going to happen to you?"
541336, "I'll accept the destiny you'll have rejected. And then I'll vanish at once, because I don't belong on this Earth. Go, sister. Make your choice. Do not tarry."
541337, "I'll come back to you yet..."
541338, "She was indeed conceived as the disease, an instrument of the Law... but she was born a thief. At the very moment of her birth, she got a chance to become someone completely different. The girl came into this world, having stolen for herself the fate of a miracle-worker."
541339, "Does this mean I'm not a toy? Why are the Powers That Be acting so strangely towards me?"
541340, "Why not? The Changeling, not knowing who she was herself, had fallen into our mirror trap. It was a surprise even to the children who were playing with her. So it was a conundrum... why, there's no point in hiding that we hadn't expected it either. So maybe, just maybe..."
541341, "How? Hadn't you made provisions for every circumstance beforehand?"
541342, "When she first performed a lesser miracle, we were ourselves astounded... We had never thought it could work. It shouldn't have."
541343, "Unbelievable..."
541347, "Why did you put me in a position like this? What was that split-personality gimmick all about?"
541348, "In fact, it was much gimmickier than a mere split personality. It was the gimmick of choosing one's own fate. A logical and temporal conundrum. A Moebius strip of events. A backup plan. And it seems to have worked. Clara is the game's main protagonist. And so is the Sand Dirt... so is the Utopia."
541349, "What was the point of this whole affair? What was the pestilence for?"
541350, "You see, we're conducting an experiment of sorts... We find the inevitability worrying and oppressive. We wanted to see for ourselves just how flawed the idea is of constructing a sarcophagus for a miracle... Or perhaps not a sarcophagus, but a space in which a miracle would always be possible."
541351, "Why 'Changeling'?"
541352, "Because that's what she is. It's her nature. And she'll stay true to it until the end... Well, almost until the end, seeing as she's the only one with the miracle option. Don't miss it."
541353, "And what about the Haruspex and the Bachelor? What are they for then?"
541354, "They haven't performed any miracles, but both had a chance to accomplish a heroic feat of a different sort... And prove or disprove a number of slippery points in the process."
541355, "The Haruspex?"
541356, "A heretical aspiration! Who do you think you are?"
541357, "This is why the Changeling was conceived as either holy or possessed. Who if not she was to solve this... essentially religious issue!"
541358, "The way you're interpreting it, it falls short of counting as religious!"
541359, "Amen to that... Still, we reserve our right to experiment."
541360, "So why did you design the Changeling like that?"
541361, "Holy or possessed? Is that the same as 'thief and miracle-worker'?"
541362, "Not quite. A thief is a miracle-worker's equal, whereas holiness is not nearly on the same level as... possession, if that's what we're going to call it; ultimately, it's a question of your freedom or lack thereof."
541363, "So why did you design the Changeling like that?"
541364, "I hate your experiments... I find them stupid and naïve."
541365, "Diverging branches. He was the only one who could attain true freedom. He wasn't facing the kind of dilemma that the ever-deceived Bachelor found so dismal."
541366, "What? Even here, you're not letting me go back to the previous selection? I'd be interested to hear about the other hero too..."
541367, "Well, sorry... You haven't made your choice yet, have you? The miracle is yet to happen. This was just a reminder."
541368, "The Bachelor?"
541369, "A tempted destroyer. He could have accomplished a feat of moral heroism. The strongest, the most straightforward, he was too strongly tempted by vengeance and destruction for his not going through with it to be anything less than... miracle, or something close to one."
541370, "What? Even here, you're not letting me go back to the previous selection? I'd be interested to hear about the other hero too..."
541371, "Enough. I'm leaving."
541372, "I think I'll find a way to even up on you too. To rub your nose and walk you into your own trap. Because it's clear to me now what your goals are."
541373, "I think I'll find a way to even up on you too. To rub your nose and walk you into your own trap. Because it's clear to me now what your goals are."
541374, "That would be the outcome we hoped for the most!"
541375, "Oh no, don't lie."
541376, "You still don't understand what I'm thinking of now..."
541378, "And the sister... Did she really exist?"
541379, "Of course not. The same being sang in two different voices. You had made her up yourself-don't you remember when? It was a falsehood..."
541380, "Well, the answer has been hinted at..."
541381, "Enough! I've seen her; I've talked to her."
541382, "Is this you talking to us now... or not? Who's speaking?"
541383, "Me. The Changeling."
541384, "Me. The player."
541385, "Then it shouldn't surprise you that at certain moments you were seeing Clara in front of you. Right?"
541386, "Hang on! Here's the important part. Who's she? The twin? The one that doesn't exist?"
541387, "Oh, we beg you pardon then. This means we're dealing with a really, really difficult medical case here... There's nothing we can do."
541388, "Hang on! Here's the important part. Who's she? The twin? The one that doesn't exist?"
541389, "Seeing as the plague girl invented her in order to save her life and dodge an accusation-she is in fact the saint and miracle-worker."
541390, "Then how can we be talking about anything resembling a choice?"
541391, "I see. In fact nothing should've worked for you at all."
541392, "Can a miracle be performed under such conditions?"
541393, "I've got an idea of my own on the subject..."
541394, "Indeed? As it happens, I've discovered the meaning of my freedom."
541395, "Of course you have. Liar."
541396, "So listen how my plot's unfolded... As you probably know I've been deceived three times by people I sincerely trusted. First the Powers That Be, then the Inquisitor-and now, finally, I've found out what the point of the whole affair is. I'm a plaything! And so, undoubtedly, are you."
541397, "I know already... So what now? I suppose you'll suggest that I leave it to you to decide?"
541398, "Of course! How did you know?"
541399, "What, for your sake? You're a plaything!"
541400, "Really? Then could you please make it so that I could show up at the Council and present the Commander with arguments in favour of the following arrangement: the corrupt town disappears from the face of the earth, and the Polyhedron stays. It's aseptic and... damn it, it's simply worthy of preserving!"
541401, "What does that require?"
541404, "I wrote to you about them the other day. But in case you lost that letter, I'll tell you how to spot them. They all want one thing, and that's to preserve the marvellous Tower. Nothing else matters to them."
541406, "No. That will not be."
541431, "I'll try to do something. How do I know who your Bound are?"
541433, "All right. I'll come. If you tell Block yourself that you're on my side, the Inquisitor will be disarmed."
541446, "It appears that you've been helpful... Without you, Rubin wouldn't have discovered what my calling was."
541455, "Really? Then I could present the Commander with arguments in favour of a proposal that will preserve the town at the cost of destroying the Tower. This is a wise arrangement, and-as my heart tells me-a lasting one. I'm thinking about the future of my community."
541456, "What will you need for it?"
541458, "I will. Have you got your panacea?"
541459, "I'm out of panacea. I'll have to use the last flask and the last batch of ingredients at the Council, as an argument in favour of my proposal. You don't need it anyway, do you? Isn't it true that you can heal with your hands?"
541461, "No. I don't need you at the Cathedral, Burakh. Goodbye."
541486, "You are an instrument of the Law. At least keep that in mind now that you've chanced to be able to make the choice here. Don't try to be something greater than you are. That's the best you could do in your position."
541487, "You're wrong, Aglaya Lilich. I could do a lot in my position."
541488, "But you still want me to topple the Tower in the process, don't you? While I don't think there are any good reasons to do that, other than it being what you insist on..."
541489, "...And so you want to destroy the whole town? And that's after all your talk of love, kindness and mercy..."
541490, "I agree that an act like that wouldn't befit a saint. But you deny my sainthood, don't you? So your reproach is unfair."
541491, "I am the Sand Fever, an embodiment of the Law. I have begun the culling of this town, and I will complete it. Such is my decision."
541492, "You want to settle scores with me? Is that it?"
541493, "I haven't observed any logic in your words and actions, Aglaya Lilich. If I was an instrument of the Law, why did you banish me?"
541494, "I have touched you. Tremble. You are condemned."
541495, "Because you had yielded to a temptation. You had embarked on a perverse course of action: to preserve this outrageous synthesis, which is nothing but a death machine-and to add more deaths to the tally for the sake of its preservation! Your words had also led astray the Bachelor and the Haruspex, to whom I had taken such pains to explain the real state of affairs."
541496, "Really? I didn't know that..."
541497, "You'll never understand this... because you are a sacrificial victim passionately seeking to avoid her lot. So don't judge your superiors, even though you've been invested with the power to judge and to punish them!"
541498, "I haven't settled on my sacrificial victim yet. Keep that in mind. All right?"
541499, "What are you talking about?"
541500, "My principal goal is not to destroy the Polyhedron but to heal the town."
541501, "What are you getting at?"
541502, "Hence I would recommend you to turn your attention to Dankovsky, who intends to destroy the town. Touch him..."
541503, "You are a destroyer and a killer, Burakh. But for me, you would've drowned your town in blood. Was that what you wanted to save it for?"
541504, "But I'm not the plague and not a murderer. What's a touch from me going to do to him?"
541505, "You're a destroyer. You have a cold heart. You can't fully fathom even the true beauty of that Tower of mirrors, whose nature still eludes you..."
541506, "I've made up my own mind already, Bachelor."
541507, "Yes. I admit I have an ulterior motive here. I'd be glad if I didn't have to wreck the town; I might even believe the Ripper... wild though the idea may be. But the only thing he wants is to remove Aglaya from his prophecy..."
541508, "What are you talking about? What prophecy?"
541509, "The Kin demands that he kill her. She is his sacrifice. Without it, they won't acknowledge him as a Foreman and Warden... He wants to deceive both them and fate-and to frame the matter differently. He wants to kill the Polyhedron!"
541510, "But the only thing you want is to preserve the Polyhedron and destroy Aglaya."
541511, "Yes, I love the Polyhedron. It is alive, no less alive than the Earth, and is worthy of love. It, too, is inhabited by a collective body; it, too, is infused with a divine essence; it, too, is the dwelling-place of a soul, if you like!"
541512, "Don't fret, Bachelor. I know what you're driven by."
541513, "What, is it alive? Why do you put it like that?"
541514, "This whole town is like a pair of conjoined twins. Everything is alive here. I understand this very well! You can't even imagine how well..."
541515, "No, I'm not ready to go outside yet... There will be no turning back. I must make up my mind."
541516, "This person is sick. No, don't blame yourself-that's not your fault. One of your rival counterparts must have overlooked them... or left them on purpose. Nevertheless, no entry. It's under quarantine. I keep a sorrowful watch."
541517, "Can't they be helped?"
541518, "Even being one of the Bound, they're just an ordinary person. They can be cured, just like any other. You're the healer here, it's your area of expertise."
541519, "All right, I'll try to think of something."
541520, "I only need to speak to them. Through the door maybe."
541521, "They are unconscious. The development of the disease is uneven, sure, and this person can resist it longer than a commoner would, but there'll be no talking. Unless you offer them a good antibiotic. That could bring them back to life for a while."
541522, "Yes... That is an option, even though it's temporary."
541523, "All the better. Stand your guard."
541524, "Then get to it. You shall begin with Grace, the late cemetery caretaker's daughter. She is especially dear to me."
541525, "I'm going to Grace this very minute."
541526, "With Grace? Doesn't she sympathize with you... with us?"
541527, "I want to be certain of that. Make friends with her. And if you need to find out more about her, Lara Ravel is the person who will tell you all about Lasca. She is as much of an angel of kindness as the poor daughter of the caretaker... and her father has recently died too."
541528, "I'll find a key to her."
541529, "According to one of my faithfuls, a wounded man has slipped away. He should be somewhere near the town cemetery by now. "
541530, "The wounded factory worker was carried off by the Ripper."
541531, "The wounded man has escaped yet again. With what little time he had, he should be hiding somewhere nearby. Could he be in the house by the river? Burakh said that there were blood stains all over the embankment."
541532, "I'm going to drop by often."
541533, "Please do not think I'm finding it unpleasant. And even if I did..."
541534, "Let's dispense with the courtesies. Victoria, do you love your brother?"
541535, "What did we talk about?"
541536, "You asked if I could hide you away in a safe place. Somewhere you won't be found by your persecutors... So I told you."
541537, "Ah... So what's the place?"
541538, "In the Atrium, of course... Are you making fun of me? Is this a joke?"
541539, "I'm not. It's no laughing matter at all..."
541540, "I want to talk to you. Your elder brother... what kind of a person is he? People say you don't love him."
541541, "I do love him very much! And he loves me. We have a great affection for each other."
541543, "Why do they say then that you two don't talk to each other? And haven't seen each other for a year?"
541544, "Yes. I think he'll be glad to see me..."
541546, "Beggar? Now what is that supposed to mean?"
541547, "Oh why do you take everything personally? It's actually kind of self-enamored on your part. And by the way, we call them as we please. Who are you to tell us otherwise!"
541548, "Tsk... So how does it all work?"
541549, "Smarty Pants, huh? It got off lightly, it seems..."
541550, "Bark and more bark; where's the bite, Aspity?"
541553, "No. I haven't met any big fellows."
541554, "Repent."
541555, "Who did you want to kill? "
541556, "A guild fellow of mine... his ardour was disproportionate to his talent... You see, he nearly convinced the rulers to grant him that side of the river for his project... Yes, he deserved to die. But I didn't kill him... "
541557, "So who did? "
541558, "What was his name? "
541559, "What's the difference? We had him buried under a fictitious name-a tribute to a celebrated architect of old, so there's some consolation for him, at least..."
541560, "Who are 'we'? "
541561, "I must have a reason to keep that secret, don't you think, old boy? Why would I torture myself over it otherwise? They say he fell down from a great height and broke his neck. That's how he died. I've also heard a rumour that he got lethally intoxicated with bad twyrine..."
541562, "You do realize that your secrets are easily seen through, don't you, Peter?"
541563, "Well, not by Saburov..."
541564, "Doesn't Saburov have real murderers to keep himself busy with? Why in the world would he waste his time trying to get even with you!"
541565, "Against the current background, this dubious murder seems really too unimpressive to warrant such a diabolical revenge."
541566, "A demon can't do a good deed? Not once? Ha ha, you are so naïve! What if it wanted to trick you?"
541567, "A Steppe spirit can do no good under any circumstances."
541568, "But who told you that the what you're getting me to do is good?"
541569, "That is, for once, something I'm confident about."
541570, "For sure?"

541573, "I know where the Great Pit is. Always wanted to know what a Great Spit would sound like inside."
541574, "By the way, I've found the Bachelor."
541575, "How brave you are! Did he say anything? Is Loafer all right?"
541576, "Apparently he found the boy and took the powder from him. He was acting rather strangely when I met him."
541577, "Instead of looking for the boy, he got carried away trying to hunt down the Haruspex."
541578, "...Could it be he was testing that horrible mixture on himself?"
541579, "I really hope he was!"
541580, "I don't know. Well, I have to go. Goodbye, Capella."

541582, ""
541583, "They say the Kains have their own little shop... and they offer stuff at bargain prices. But it's not like anyone can waltz in there and buy whatever they like-the offer is reserved for the poor and the people that the Kains consider especially trustworthy... I wonder where this shop is?"
541584, "I wonder whom the Kains trust..."
541585, "Well I never! You're a theatre person on top of everything? For a being of such purity, your interests are amazingly broad! And here I thought a holy person would shrug at the allure of vain worldly pastimes..."
541586, "Are you doing that on purpose? Are you a pathological buffoon?"
541587, "Mark Immortell, I accuse you of heresy and blasphemy. You were the one that brought down the plague upon the town!"

541594, "Will the Bachelor be coming home tonight? If he can't find me, he'll probably spend the whole night scouring the town... And if he does find me?"
541595, "Who else could have the secret keys to the brother if not the girl? Maybe she'll give me one-then I won't need a hook..."
541596, "Yes. But this discovery does not eliminate the overall danger. The country will have no peace until the source of this disease is found. "
541597, "Yes... All I want is to survive for four more days. The rest doesn't matter."
541598, "No, not at all."
541600, "If you help me, there will be no need for gallows."
541601, "Could I perhaps beg a small favour of the omnipotent Bachelor? Please help me out of this place! I've already heard the shabnak whispering in my ear..."
541602, "That's quite right, my good man. Obey-and you will live."
541603, "If we ourselves are to suffer deception-our hands are no longer tied..."
541604, "Yes, I often remain unnoticed..."
541605, "Why?"
541606, "Say your name."
541607, "Oh, I get called all sorts of things... I go by at least six different names right now."
541608, "I'm Clara. But I don't think the name particularly suits me."
541609, "I can't tell. I have to be cautious..."
541610, "That's just my fate. Never what it ought to be..."
541611, "Thank you, Maria. "
541612, "I lied. I need them for myself. I wanted to use the Inquisitor's name to get to the precious statistics."
541613, "Okay...! Take them. Why wouldn't I let you have them?"
541614, "Why indeed. Hand the papers over!"
541615, "No, no, no... This will not do. You have received the invitation of the Powers That Be, haven't you? Why haven't you visited the Focus of the Specular Tower? It's a rather curious place. Go, have a look... And then come back here. Otherwise the impression will be lost on you."
541616, "What makes you think I haven't been there?"
541617, "To the Focus? Of course you haven't. Had you gone there, you'd look very different now... Trust me, I've seen a lot of you lot... It's okay, the town is clear, you'll manage to go there and come back in half an hour. We can wait."
541618, "Well, as you wish. "
541619, "Yes, the town looks clean-but I know what hides beneath this false purity!"
541620, "Oops, forgot about that."
541621, "No, no, no... This will not do. You have received the invitation of the Powers That Be, haven't you? Why didn't you pay a visit to the Focus of the Specular Tower? It's a rather curious place. Go, have a look... And then come back here. Otherwise the impression will be lost on you."
541622, "What makes you think I haven't been there?"
541623, "To the Focus? Of course you haven't. Had you gone there, you'd look very different now... Trust me, I've seen a lot of you lot... It's okay, the town is clear, you'll manage to go there and come back in half an hour. We can wait."

541629, "I've already been there. I know who's hiding there all right."
541630, "Yes, yes... But do visit the place all the same. They too know that you know that they know... etcetera. Reflections! They realize you're not like those two unfortunates. Perhaps they'll also be smart enough to offer you a more engaging story than they offered them."
541631, "They are figments of other people's imagination, just like the cobbles under my feet. What could they come up with that you wouldn't know?"
541632, "It seems like a hideout for creatures utterly devoid of meaning and purpose. But fine, I will. Pity about the waste of time, though."
541633, "Hypocrite! Why not just say it-that it's predetermined; that I have to visit the Focus and will only be allowed here after that. Oh, you silly miracle-worker wannabes..."
541636, "Where shall you go now, oynon? Who will you look in the face? "
541637, "I was going to ask you the same. "
541638, "I don't know... I did everything I could. "
541639, "I'm looking forward to midnight!"
541640, "You are a midnight creature, aren't you?"
541641, "I, on the other hand, don't think I'm going to watch all this."
541642, "*** I lost my temper! Burakh will not want to talk to me anymore."
541643, "I know. I know it wasn't your well."
541644, "Simon Kain and I are... connected. Perhaps even similar. Through me, he'll return into this world."
541645, "Interesting. So you say you are the means to his rebirth? How is that to be understood? Surely not literally? Otherwise... forgive me for not believing you. From what I know, Simon will return as early as tomorrow."
541646, "No. All I meant was that my actions are somehow bringing back what has disappeared from the world after his death."
541647, "Do you still insist that you're able to perform miracles?"
541648, "But how?"
541649, "That is none of your concern."
541650, "You want to bring him back with magic! But that's sacrilegious..."
541651, "Yes. And that's precisely the explanation."
541652, "No, no... I don't insist on that."
541653, "Such matters are beyond your comprehension, Changeling."
541654, "And so you are the miracle-worker here? Is that what you believe?"
541655, "You are a necromancer and a warlock, Georgiy. I've always felt that you Kains are my most formidable opponents."
541656, "And thank God for that!"
541657, "As far as I could understand him, Simon's blood had been shed because of me... Is that what you think too?"
541658, ""
541659, "...Here you are. I've got everything I ever wanted now... "
541660, "You are very beautiful... so lifelike. But you're incorporeal, aren't you?"
541661, "I knew I'll find you here. "
541663, "Oh, but look around! Can you see who is sitting down below now? The ruthless Inquisitor-hand in hand with the bloodstained Haruspex! The beak-headed demons are wandering the shrine and the faceless are serving her... I'm so scared!"
541664, "You have commited an inexcusable, irreparable folly... "
541665, "Don't torture yourself... Do not assume I've done it for you. Not at all. I just wanted to inhabit this place. To bring the Cathedral to life a bit... so that there were at least something miraculous here."
541666, "I see... "
541667, "Suicide is not the way to fill the Cathedral with grace. "
541668, "...Tell me, Eva, does Maria have anything to do with your death? "
541669, "Maria, Maria, Maria once again! Why, why do you have to keep talking about her? What does she have to do with this... You are with me now... And it will only last for such a little while! So why ask me about Maria? As if there was nothing else to talk about... "
541670, "Why did you do it then? Was it really because of..."
541671, "Easy now... These are ordinary Executors. "
541672, "Can you hear a whisper beneath the dome? They're speaking to me, but I cannot make out their tongue... I was a slow learner... But I can feel the tone. They're threatening... and condemning me... "
541673, "I hear nothing. "
541674, "What am I supposed to do... I have condemned myself to being imprisoned within these walls. How long am I to endure this torment! But perhaps everything can change? Perhaps the evil that's dissolved here comes from the Inquisitor and not from me?"
541675, "You also think so? Oh, I'm so scared! I fear that I've released something malevolent with my actions... Yes, this place is no longer empty... And something mystical has indeed appeared-I feel it all the time. But it frightens me so very much! What does it mean... how do you think?"
541676, "But now I can fly! A miracle happened! All I had to do was strain my legs a bit... and fly. It's just that I had to abandon my body not to go down... otherwise I would have fallen..."
541677, "So you have breathed life into this Cathedral. Do not grieve, Eva. You have not died in vain."
541678, "You are the only one who could have said this... I knew you'd be the only one to believe in my miracle... Because you're special. You wouldn't judge me too harshly. You're not... not really picky, and you are free from religious dogmas. Do you acknowledge my miracle?"
541679, "... Yes. I do. But why are you shivering? Is there something depressing you?"
541680, "Don't be afraid of anything. "
541681, "...I am not an expert on religious matters- and tonight is the first time ever that I regret it!"
541682, "I need the truth. "
541683, "...No. It wasn't Maria. But enough for now. Go. I don't want to see you anymore. "
541684, "I'd like to stay with you a little more. "
541685, "That would be well within your power. You're a spirit, so you can disappear easily. "
541686, "This is unnecessary. Although... I am eternally bound to these walls now-until this Cathedral falls. I shall never see other worlds. "
541687, "Until the Cathedral falls... "
541688, "I'll make you free soon, Eva. "
541689, "But that's exactly what happened-you have fallen down... you idiot!"
541690, "No, Eva. You have committed suicide. Now this Cathedral is desecrated and cursed. "
541691, "Does the Inquisitor bring evil? Is it true that she has deceived us pretending that evil is good?"
541692, "I think so. I'm observing her when no one else is looking, you know. Yes... she's vicious and arrogant. One should never behave themselves like she does. Even I have never allowed myself to do anything of the kind. She despises you and hates everyone else."
541693, "Such is the fate of anyone who commits suicide."
541694, "So I thought... "
541695, "Will you come here again? "
541696, "...Yes. I will. "
541697, "No, Eva. We are seeing each other for the last time now. "
541698, "You are most likely correct."
541699, "Soon I will free you. Farewell, Eva. "
541700, "Yes, lady Katerina."
541701, "That's right. You're a good girl, caretaker's daughter."
541702, "But you can't heal with blood! ...Or can you?"
541703, "That's not quite fair... But evil is alien to me. I've always helped people. And always considered it a blessing."
541704, "I know. I've seen it too recently."
541705, "Why are you speaking as if you were reciting a psalm?"
541706, "Because there are no other words to speak properly of such things. And as for you, obedience will suit you much better than waywardness at this time. You are in too questionable a position-and it is beyond my power to change that on my own."
541707, "I fear nothing. My conscience is clear."
541708, "Of course I will care of them. After all, who's more in need of care than those rejected by everyone? They'll get their own chance to serve a good cause too... won't they?"
541709, "Women who weave time into threads of power. They let power go through them and then let the threads back out. Even as men are building a town from wood and stone, the Mistresses weave its soul from intangible substances. The joys and the sorrows, the epiphanies and the lethargies, the feelings, the inspirations, that is the yarn that the Mistresses spin."
541710, "How did they appear?"
541711, "I think I understand. Feels familiar..."
541712, "Are they different, these Mistresses? How?"
541713, "And the third one? Who was the third Mistress?"
541714, ""
541715, "So? You got it? No tail behind you?"
541716, "I got it, I got it... Come on, take it, time is of the essense."
541717, "Stop sweating it, will you? No one was following me. Just look outside the window."
541718, "I've brought you some mincemeat for barter... Take a look."
541719, "I'm very scared now..."
541720, "Who knows... Everything points to it."
541722, "And she is indeed your twin? Are you impossible to tell apart?"
541723, "Yes! That's truly how it is."
541724, "...What more evidence do they need? And how much of it?"
541725, "We shall see. Tonight Katerina and I are going to talk about you. Tomorrow we shall state our will to you. And if everything turns out well, tomorrow you may already be helping me restore justice and mete out retribution. What destiny Katerina foresees for you I cannot tell. In the meantime, rest. Take the small bedroom upstairs."
541726, "Not miracles, I hope? I can't be commissioned to perform one! It's a power bestowed to me from above!"
541727, "Good night to you. An unquiet one though it may be."
541728, "And you, do you know this man?"
541729, "I met him today. He made a good impression on me. A determined, clever, and honest man."
541730, "That's not what he seemed to me. I'm sure he's a servant of evil. He has long sharp teeth and slit-like red eyes!"
541731, "Really? He could have been just tired. He has complained to me about quickly becoming exhausted in our climate."
541732, "Ah, you're joking! And I'm not joking at all. He's an evil demon! Throw me out if you like, but don't trust him!"
541733, "But he seemed to immediately despise me."
541734, "Don't worry. His opinion of you, whatever it may be, will not influence mine."
541735, "...Really?"
541736, "Why will it always be falling? I'm a good person..."
541737, "But people are convinced to the contrary. You will exist in several guises here. The guise that will live in the collective mind-and, one may speculate, the collective memory-is a most terrifying one. Every day, people will witness signs of your otherworldly nature. They will be frightened."
541738, "No! I will be remembered for my mercy! And always spoken of in praise! You'll see!"
541739, "Doesn't matter... It won't help them any."
541740, "I know all that! There's no need to teach me the basics."
541742, "Just dropping in... Don't spill the beans yourself!"
541743, "I know. I know all that already. Goodbye, good soul."
541744, "I'm stalking for prey. If you don't need this goon, he'll do for me."
541745, "Where are those robbers?"
541746, "Over there, next to the cars... Be careful, don't come close! They're wicked good knife-throwers."
541747, "So they stabbed this guttersnipe with a knife?"
541748, "Why?"
541749, "Looks very suspicious. Unsteady eyes, like he's done something nasty. The kind you can tell is a scoundrel at once. Murmurs something that cannot be understood-threatens to kill somebody. See, he hasn't got the kind of head that honest folk have, either... But he seems more afraid of the Warehouse people than of me. Still, he wouldn't say a word to me."
541750, "Is this dog-headed midget also in Alexander's service?"
541751, "So that's who he is... The Ripper!"
541752, "No. He's the Haruspex."
541753, "Dear me... That's even worse. So where does he live?"
541754, "Thank you, Grace! I'll stay away from the Works."
541755, "So what did you do to become hunted like that?"
541756, "Who would know me, Executor? I barely recognize myself anymore..."
541757, "Off you go, then. Come back when you get a costume. Then we'll quite rightfully pass you for one of us."
541758, "Wait for me."
541759, "*** It was a failure. I shouldn't have lost my temper...."
541760, "Anna, I'm back. The Olgimskys are waiting. Give me the medicine. It won't help you anyway."
541761, "...How can you know they won't help?"
541762, "Pray, Anna. You're looking for salvation in the wrong place."
541763, "So you're afraid, then... That's a clever girl."
541764, "Everyone is equally deserving of a severe punishment."
541765, "*** ...How do they call upon the menkhu, the faithful of a Warden kin? Known by their hands, for they are butchers; known by their eyes, for they are surgeons; known by their deeds, for they follow the lines. Freezing within the burial hole, silent at the threshold of non-existence, the Kin do not greet the worthy Warden. If only you arrived earlier. /n/nIt was a rash decision. Now I will never know what I could have learned today."
541766, "Hang on... What was it you said? 'Soul-and-a-Half'?"
541767, "Yep."
541768, "How can someone have a soul and a half?"
541769, "Some people even have two, but they're freaks. You see, a soul-and-a-half is a monster. A demon, sort of like a hobgoblin or a dust-wraith. That's why he's a monster-because he has more than one soul. That's the idea."
541770, "I see... So-they attacked you? Hurt you?"
541771, "So your friends are monsters?"
541772, "No, they're a different kind of Soul-and-a-Halves. It's what they named themselves to make the Dogheads afraid of them. Not that anyone is afraid of them, of course. Our might will crush them all! Actually, the reason for the name is that they've each got a Half. A little pet familiar. That's who they get the extra soulage from. And boy do they adore the little beasts!"
541773, "...My heart is beating so fast now... Why would that be? Or have I felt this before?"
541774, "And what did you do to make them throw you out?"
541775, "And there I was wondering how a pathetic creature like you could vex everyone so much. Turns out you're really asking for it..."
541776, "You're a real scoundrel, aren't you..."
541777, "Why so?"
541778, "Why? Because first I get chased away into the Steppe by my Soul-and-a-Half mates-and then I run into a Ripper there to boot. Boy was I begging him to let me go-but the bastard knew what I'd been picked on for, then pulled out his knife, and here I am, carved up like so much fillet. It hurts. Help me, will you?"
541779, "Poor thing... Come on, come to me, let me touch you with my hands. You'll feel better."
541781, "Look at my footprints carefully. You may notice something unusual."
541782, "How do you know?"
541783, "I know a lot. Are you forgetting who you're talking to?"
541784, "That's what I've heard from the people who were robbing the dead at the station. Be careful, if they find out you gave him shelter, they'll come for you too..."
541785, "No one would dare to touch me... least of all a robber. There's no one villainous enough here to pull a knife to me... That's what my father used to tell me-and that's how it's always been."
541786, "Everything's going to change soon, Grace. Keep your lodge locked at night. Expect no mercy from anyone, dead or living..."
541787, "Why do they honour you so much?"
541788, "For feeding them-long after no one else would. For singing songs to their ancestors and comforting those slain at their hands."
541789, "What would be the point of living under a sky like that? No, my door will never be locked."
541790, "So where's your wounded man?"
541791, "So where's your wounded man?"
541792, "...Death?"
541793, "No. Leaning over the wounded worker was the scary man who'd inflicted all those wounds on him in the first place. I asked him not to kill the workman, but to heal him with living blood instead. And he, the scary one, said nothing for a long time-there was just the sound of his wheezy breath-but then he took the workman and dragged him off somewhere. To his den, he said..."
541794, "A robber?"
541795, "You have to have the blood of a man who is still alive and walks the earth. Infusing this blood into a wounded man's veins, if done right, will be beneficial."
541796, "And that man knew?"
541797, "I need him."
541798, "What do you mean, vanished?"
541799, "I brought the wounded man here. Examined him. He was beyond hope. Then I went to get... my tools. When I came back he was gone. That was ten minutes ago. The trail of blood led back to the town. I saw blood on the embankment too, but that doesn't tell us a lot. So I've lost him. Where could he go?"
541800, "And what were you intending to do to him, you cruel man? He was still alive, wasn't he?"
541801, "I'll look for him on the embankment. He may have found shelter at one of the houses."
541802, "You fear me, Ripper. And rightly so. You must already feel that I'll be the undoing of your gory plans."
541803, "What a gloomy and damp place! No human being could live here..."
541804, "I have no time for this."
541805, "No. Do tell."
541817, "She believes that we want to bring Simon back to life in a manner that western legends attribute to necromancers. She thinks we are trying to exchange his life for many other lives that are freely given away... It seems that Aglaya Lilich is well-prepared to blame us for every life lost this past week. Why wouldn't she, if she thinks that we benefit from every single death?"
541818, "Surely that is not the case?"
541819, "A memory? I'm not sure I follow."
541820, "Dealing with the dead calls for scientific precision, doctor. In reality there is neither magic, nor necromancy. The dead cannot be raised from their graves. Their souls may not be transfused into inanimate objects. No one truly expects the spirits of their ancestors to reappear in their newborns..."
541821, "What a relief..."
541822, "Would you like to know more about what I mean by 'dealing with the dead'?"
541823, "Of course."
541824, "There is life after death. That much is certain. A man most certainly has a soul. And that soul certainly belongs to a better world-more so than to the one it leaves behind. Trying to prolong the time the soul has to stay here is not doing it any favours."
541825, "Yes. Undoubtedly."
541826, "No. Why are you telling me all this?"
541827, "I know. She even talked of this before."
541830, "My compliments, good Doc. Shell out the cash 'n we'll show you the stash, eh? He heh... Oh hey, your artillery mortar's arrived, Doc, the one you're gettin' for free. Go get it..."
541833, "I don't think it's yours, is it? Or are you just that fast...?"
541834, "Felix, qui potuti rerum cogoscere causas."
541836, "No, certainly not."
541837, "He might even survive this, what with him being Simon's brother."
541838, "Qui ingorabat, ingorabitur..."
541839, "Heads up, Kaspar!"
541840, "Grace? No, it's not Grace who's gone mad... "
541842, "Wrong. There's an Executor standing at your door."
541843, "An Executor is standing at your door, Anna."
541844, "Isn't there an Executor at your door?"
541845, "Impostor? Changeling? What?"
541846, "Are you going to deny it?"
541847, "I am too! I've come here to set everything right. Should it matter to you what I call myself?"
541848, "No use arguing..."
541849, "How dare you!"
541850, "Have a tip, kind sir. Now off you go..."
541851, "Like the Tower?"
541852, "...Why have you constructed the Polyhedron, Andrey? "
541853, "You've ruined the town, Andrey. "
541854, "'Scraps'...? Oh, you mean the bacteria! Yes, it makes sense. Sorry, I just thought you meant... something else."
541855, "Don't go, Rubin. If you care for my opinion at all, stay! I'll definitely need your help down the line."
541856, "I knew it... I knew you were going to do this!"
541857, "I'm sure Georgiy's decision will be fair and just."
541858, "Ahem... I was hoping it was the other way round..."
541860, "This is ridiculous. "
541861, "At ten o'clock? "
541862, "I see. So what are you going to do? "
541863, "You're not doing yourself any favours by being abrasive."
541864, "I apologize for the unfortunate choice of words."
541865, "So you want to stop them?"
541866, "Don't you worry, I'll do just that."
541869, "Well, I suppose I salute you too."
541871, "Oh really?"
541872, "I don't fancy myself anything. I'm not pretending to be someone I'm not. I am what I am."
541873, "Seriously? You're threatening an emissary of the Powers That Be? Or have you forgotten whose envoy you're standing before?"
541874, "Compared to Him who has sent me, Him who is guiding me-those you serve are mere puppets, mere toys in His hands!"
541875, "I'm sorry... I didn't mean to say that."
541876, "I don't know..."
541877, "Of course I do! Or do you suppose harmony is the same as beauty, you dim pathetic creature?"
541878, "I'm not talking about beauty... I'm talking about the miracle of salvation! "
541879, "Why am I pathetic?"
541881, "I'll tell you why you're a thief later. I just need to see you in action first, so that I could finally convince myself."
541882, "Did the Bachelor inform on me? Did he say that I'm the personification of the disease? But that's not true!"
541883, "In due time, inquisitor, I'll be the one judging you. Then you'll see what my kind of justice is like."
541884, "Right. Like there was any doubt about that... The outcome was predetermined-is that what you're saying?"
541885, "No, it's not about the outcome being predetermined. It certainly wasn't. What's true, however, is that the particular course of action you were going to take was completely irrelevant to me."
541886, "Why?"
541888, "...Actually, I'm the reason all of this exists."
541889, "I know already."
541890, "Don't they care about the people?"
541891, "So you're representing the Law? Then I'd like to ask you a question which has been weighing on my mind for days."
541892, "I don't need rewards... I won't cleanse anything from now on-just to make you sorry for not believing me!"
541893, "Go ahead and ask. As you can see, I'm being very nice to you for now. Not merely satisfying your curiosity, but going as far as to try and preempt it."
541894, "Why am I being hounded as a thief? What does it mean?"
541895, "You're in good mood. Is it on account of your previous visitor?"
541896, "Impudent girl! Are you trying to play games with me?"
541897, "No... I wanted to ask a question. Why am I being hounded? Why are they calling me a thief?"
541898, "Playing games with you would be boring. My little dolls are more fun."
541899, "It means that this is your nature. It means that this is your preordainment. As to what exactly it is that you've stolen... that's just the question I'm trying to find the answer to. What kind of a theft can possibly upturn the very foundations of existence? It's no wonder that the Law is after you. You are a great criminal indeed."
541900, "...Is that why my Bound are, by and large, all criminals?"
541901, "Your Bound are no mere criminals; they're wicked to a rare degree. That is because they've broken the Law. They are to blame for all the evil that has flooded the world."
541902, "But is anyone who breaks it necessarily a monster and a fiend? I'm talking about myself here!"
541903, "Isn't it too cruel to blame a handful of people for all the evil in existence?"
541904, "We're inherently evil, Clara. Evil is what defines human nature. An attempt at self-discovery is a provocation. Don't make the mistake that your doomed counterparts are making now. Stand down."
541905, "The Bachelor and the Haruspex? How are they my counterparts?"
541906, "That will not be. I haven't fulfilled my calling yet. And I won't leave until I've fulfilled it-even if it's evil."
541907, "Yes, they're hopeless. The issue is moot in their case. They never had an alternative-having never reached that degree of complexity. While you've had the misfortune to reach it, and that is your curse. Stand down before it's too late. What they can be forgiven for, you can't be."
541908, "No! I won't leave. I'm staying."
541909, "So this is a trap? All right. I'll think it over..."
541910, "You still have time. I'm going to use you in my experiments. You see, I know who we all really are-while some, including your counterparts, don't know yet... I'm going to watch you tread the same path. And if I'm guessing correctly, and you really have those abilities... this place won't forgive you for it. And neither will I."
541911, "Well, be my guest..."
541912, "They're not my counterparts. They are homunculi, demons, notwithstanding their human shape. Don't equate me with them! I'm not afraid."
541913, "And what role would that be?"
541914, "And what if I don't reveal myself? If I just deliberately won't?"
541915, "You will. Any single action of yours will tell me more about you than you think. And that includes refraining from an action."
541916, "You sound as if I were some animal you were studying!"
541917, "Well, at least that's something... Or are you implying that I only have myself to blame?"
541918, "Don't try to be clever, my dear. It's getting boring. Really, we ought to be done with this quicker..."
541919, "So what's going to happen today?"
541920, "...Another wicked criminal?"
541921, "Judging by what I've managed to find out, he's elbow-deep-nay, shoulder-deep in blood. An amazing specimen of irredeemable sin. He has no concept of mercy, and no conscience. Come to think of it, I'm not sure he has a soul at all."
541922, "What if I do find a soul in him?"
541923, "What do you need him for?"
541924, "You can try. I think it would be an exercise in futility."
541925, "It will be another small miracle then..."
541926, "Guilty, of course... Everyone's guilty."
541927, "Wrong! I'm capable all right! Don't try to convince me that I'm like that... foreman of yours!"
541928, "Quiet now... Don't yell. Surprising in a holy person like you, this fervent insistence on your predilection for lying... Falsehood are evil. A stench rising from the abyss of death."
541929, "What a hypocrite you are! Goodbye. I don't want to be here any longer."
541930, "The choice is yours... As usual."
541931, "Aren't you afraid that I could deceive you?"
541932, "Don't put yourself on that list. I'm watching you too... and your true nature will not escape me."
541933, "All sorts of things. He does have a soul, by the way..."
541934, "'Acknowledged Foreman Oyun as being in possession of an immortal soul.' Note taken. Very good, my dear. Anything to add to that?"
541935, "We also talked about Burakh, the Haruspex-that demon who certainly has no soul!"
541936, "I'm not telling you anything. I find you abhorrent!"
541937, "He said he was going to kill him. One can hardly wait... right?"
541938, "Now that's a dramatic change of expression if I've ever seen one!"
541939, "What do you mean, which part? I hate him!"
541940, "I will reward you if you do exactly as you've been told. Don't for a moment think I won't find a way to check. So no trying to deceive me!"
541941, "You're kicking me and asking for my help at once! I'd rather you made up your mind..."
541942, "You're much easier to deceive than you think, Aglaya Lilich."
541943, "'A little'! I don't need anything from you!"
541944, "And how did you do it?"
541945, "With a miracle. You won't understand."
541946, "I've banished... a certain someone from there."
541947, "A carrier?"
541948, "...Maybe."
541949, "It was my sister. I never expected to run into her... It's insane..."
541950, "Then how can I verify the truth of your words? It's easy to claim credit for a work that does itself. I once knew a man who'd convinced an entire village that the sun would have stopped rising in the east but for his heroic effort. Incidentally, he too was considered a saint..."
541951, "You have no alternative. Isn't it your duty to cleanse the entire town of the infection? If the Powers That Be find out you had a chance to reduce it and didn't take it..."
541952, "You understood everything long ago... I can see it in your eyes. So why are you afraid of admitting I'm right?"
541953, "How indeed? What are you driving at, impudent girl?"
541954, "I was just expressing my sympathy for you..."
541955, "I'm glad the demon is dead."
541956, "People tend to demonize what they can't understand... You see a twisted image of yourself in your counterparts... more powerful, while also badly damaged... You don't understand how the two qualities combine. But you're wrong. How is he a demon, silly? He is just like you."
541957, "I don't think so. He's not a miracle-worker. I mean, was not."
541958, "Actually you're right... But that changes nothing."
541959, "Of course you just thought you saw them. What could possibly happen to me?"
541960, "What, what is it? I don't see my soles..."
541961, "Here's the plan for today. You will go to the Kains and find out why this perverted Polyhedron is so precious to them. Same pretext: say I'm accusing them of starting the epidemic. The 'it's a work of art' evasion is no longer an acceptable answer."
541962, "And why would it be unacceptable? How is it not a work of art? If I had a tower like that it would be precious to me too!"
541963, "The Bachelor is already working on this theory. What I need is mysticism. He doesn't understand it; you will. Even if you won't, you'll still be able to passably communicate it to me. Any more questions?"
541964, "How many questions can I ask now?"
541965, "No. No questions. I just need to be myself, right? Well, I'm going..."
541966, "Who am I?"
541967, "I haven't understood it yet, my dear... Perhaps you will bring me the answer today, on the soles of your shoes... Have you ever seen them? They're most curious. Every time you walk away, I look at your feet... a very interesting view!"
541968, "Don't make fun of me... Is this the final test?"
541969, "You are afraid of me, Aglaya, aren't you... That's why you haven't killed me yet. Afraid that if you do, something will be irretrievably broken, right?"
541970, "I'm just not cut out for having a fate at all."
541971, "No. It's not like that. I even like the Polyhedron. I now like whatever you hate!"
541972, "Well, so what have I found out? I doubt you know what I know now. Or else we'd be seeing less arrogance out of you... you plaything."
541973, "Why, no offence taken. A typical example of rushing to conclusions. You're behind the times. Truths like the one you just presented me with are no longer fashionable. That's more in the Bachelor and Haruspex's line... By the way, don't give them hints if you meet them. Let them work it out on their own."
541974, "All right. So what have you found out?"
541975, "Well, sum it up. And I've already found a path to victory... All these simulacra, these reflections of reflections shall confuse me no longer. I am firm in my faith! And I am free."
541976, "Oh indeed?"
541977, "So tell me... where did I come from? Speak, dummy. Try to talk me to death."
541978, "I don't need your truths. Goodbye, Aglaya Lilich. I've alredy realized how to perform a miracle that will convince you... forever."
541979, "Why?"
541980, "People aren't inclined to be on good terms with their own history-yet in this particular town, the impossible happened: the people prevailed over the power structures."
541981, "How did it happen?"
541982, "You couldn't tell by looking at them... I can see you've only been interrogating aristocrats-for the common folk, you're completely unconcerned!"
541983, "I didn't say their lives were easy or prosperous. I said they were happy. The common folk will tell you the same. The well-off are never satisfied. The local rulers had understood or sensed it. They were truly extraordinary people, and they took a creative approach to the problem of universal happiness."
541984, "How?"
541985, "It was a joke, obviously. Do you seriously think I would interpret mythical figures literally? That said, there's definitely something... obscure about you. I can't get rid of a gnawing feeling that as I stand here looking into your eyes, you're simultaneously staring at the back of my head."
541986, "That's because I'm an... unusual kind of girl. This must be a bad time for me to turn up, right?"
541987, "Is that so? That explains a lot... So you have supernatural abilities?"
541988, "Not exactly... I'm no sorceress. I comfort people. That's why they trust me."
541989, "An epidemic? No. I know nothing about it..."
541990, "Then listen. Due to the threat of an epidemic, our town's ruling families have divided certain burdensome duties among themselves. Bachelor Dankovsky has asked our family to take charge of setting up special facilities... as well as commandeering medical supplies."
541991, "Oh yes, all that medicine will be of no use to her."
541992, "I don't want to force her to surrender it.  After all... with the kind of relationship that we have, I can't afford to be rude or intimidating. And you seem capable of being really persuasive. So persuade Anna to donate her stockpile... voluntarily! She doesn't need that much anyway; It's more like compulsive hoarding at this point."
541993, "A creature more terrifying than anything you'd see in a nightmare. It's not alive, but pretends to be so. It has no will of its own, but acts with a lot of resolve. The Earth brings it forth from time to time, fashioning it out of the bones of the dead. It had magical abilities and often assumes a human shape."
541994, "Do I look even remotely like it? You hurt me... a lot!"
541995, "What is its purpose?"
541996, "The Earth fashions it when angered by men. In the old myths, the Earth would grow angry from hunger. And it would get hungry when the dead weren't buried in it. The people of the Steppe honour only the most righteous with that... So... you can guess the rest. The creature would appear in times of lawlessness. To kill, of course. Which is why they call it-call her-a Maneater."
541997, "You're saying that... a creature made of bones and clay can have warm lips, soft skin, and silky hair?"
541998, "Oh, that's just my sister... I see her eyes too when I look at you. She can also do many things that ordinary people can't. She's my twin, after all."
541999, "By the way, since you're such a master of good deeds, would you like to do something really beneficial?"
542000, "Why not? Tell me."
542001, "Those were your own words. Why ask me?"
542002, "That's the reason I'm here."
542003, "What is that supposed to mean? Explain yourself. Are you saying that you're the cause of the disease?"
542004, "No. Quite the contrary! I strive to be a source of good and good only."
542005, "Oh how your eyes light up! Let me guess... Yes, you thought you were the guiltiest party right up to this moment. And now you're hoping to find a more convenient culprit!"
542006, "You're a good psychologist... But if you thought you could intimidate me, you thought wrong. Both my conscience and the things that weigh down on it aren't nearly as big as they might seem at first glance. You shouldn't have fallen out with me so soon..."
542007, "I will come again. And then we'll have a frank conversation. It will ease your mind, I promise..."
542008, "Wait, wait... Let's not quarrel... Be nice, and I'll help you. All right?"
542009, "No. I don't think it's going to be a good deed at all. You shouldn't try to deceive me. I can see it all in your eyes."
542010, "A very wise decision."
542011, "You think? Well, perhaps... So the thing is, the town's short on medicine. We're scraping together what little we can. But there's a certain someone who's been stockpiling various drugs for five years by now... A young singer named Anna Angel."
542012, "That won't help. A completely pointless idea."
542013, "Strange girl... You act as if you're well-informed about what's going to happen to us. I hope you realize how suspicious this looks. Or do you flaunt your knowledge so openly because Saburov is in charge of punitive actions?"
542014, "No, no, it's not what it looks like! I just... blurted it out before I knew any better! Must have been a premonition. I told you I'm a little... distracted. Some would say batty."
542015, "You fool! It's exactly because the Saburovs are destined to... take charge of punitive actions, that I found shelter under their roof. Farewell."
542016, "A singer? Young singers tend to be blithe. What's up with her? Odd, very odd..."
542017, "There could be some foul play involved... But I don't think she knew or prepared anything beforehand... It's just that she lives in the Hindquarters, in Earth... A few years ago, there was a really bad outbreak right nearby. She's been buying up medicine since then."
542018, "How do you know that?"
542019, "And so?"
542020, "Well, she's been spending every last coin at the pharmacy for the past five years. She visits every pharmacy in the town on Wednesdays, buying heaps of whatever new medicine hits the market. Hard to ignore, you know."
542021, "And you're going to take her stockpile away?"
542022, "What's so strange about it?"
542023, "You know what just occurred to me? That she's already taken care of my father."
542024, "Isn't it the other way around? Nevermind, just kidding... So he advised you to ask me? Crafty, that... I've underestimated him. So essentially, he wants to do me a favour by getting this monster out of our way?"
542025, "She's a monster?"
542032, "Yes, that's right... Curious now, aren't you? No, Anna's not someone to suspect of starting the outbreak. Did she give up her stash?"
542033, "Like she had a choice! Of course she did."
542034, "How did you manage that?"
542035, "I explained to her that none of it would help anyway."
542036, "If it's true, Anna deserves to be left alone for providing valuable information. But that Anna is a crafty and dangerous beast... The offspring of a cat and a serpent-that's what her totemic ancestor was. But you won't find any proof. He's not going to succeed."
542037, "He loved Nina?"
542038, "He did. "
542039, "So he pierced the town's heart with a sting for her sake?"
542040, "Can't you see the chimney? There it is!"
542041, "I can't. I'm not too impressive in the height department, as you can see."
542042, "Thank you."
542043, "Ugh... That's horrible! Do you think he's dangerous?"
542044, "What? No... he's dead already. Although they say the dead are even more dangerous than the living! Especially if they decide to forever haunt those who'd slighted them before they died..."
542045, "No, I mean the Bachelor! I dread him for some reason... an inexplicable fear, like a premonition. He's not a turnskin, is he?"
542046, "So... the living are much more dangerous than the dead after all. But these ones seem kind..."
542047, "Are you talking about the Bachelor? I find him menacing too..."
542048, "He doesn't look cruel... You think he's the actual monster from the Steppe, whose coming was announced today? The terrible doll made of human bones? No, I don't think so. The shabnak always seeks to assume the shape of a woman."
542050, "Yes, it's those exact bones that I feel in him! He's somehow... not real. Like an animated strawman."
542051, "Don't you argue with him, though! He represents the Law now! And the Law is not on our side."
542052, "What? The Law?"
542053, "I didn't know it myself..."
542054, "By the way, he's still looking for that wounded man... He'll get here sooner or later."
542056, "Trying to mess with my head, are you, dear...? Want to lead me straight into the rogues' den? There's no way I'd go there."
542062, "Don't be silly. Children aren't evil; it's not in their nature. No, Anna, evil comes from elsewhere..."
542064, "So what if he did? Why is it making you so anxious? Surely you won't be mistaken for some homeless boy, what with this mansion of yours. Hmm?"
542065, "Yes, of course... But perhaps he didn't kill that boy after all... Then... then things aren't so terrible. Clara, do me a favour please! I really need to know if that crime has actually been committed. I mean, to know whether he really is... that cruel. Please!"
542067, "There's nothing worse than a crime against a child! Especially in this town... Only a stranger could be capable of such a savage crime. Any local would know how the Kains would react to something like that-especially the younger ones!"
542068, "Anna dear, it wasn't you who killed him... What are you so afraid of? No matter how brutal this murderer is, he's a threat to everyone equally. Trust me..."
542069, "Yes, this is terrible... monstrous."
542070, "Don't worry. It wasn't he who killed the homeless boy. It's not this neighbour of yours that you ought to be afraid of... Anna Angel."
542071, "So it's the Kains' reaction you're worried about, huh? And here I almost thought you were upset about the boy..."
542072, "Well... The Haruspex let the homeless boy go."
542073, "Oh. Thank goodness. But perhaps he didn't do it out of kindness of heart? Did he?"
542074, "Good heavens... So it's true."
542075, "Looks like you're not particularly interested in who killed him. So it's not the Haruspex that you were afraid of..."
542076, "It was I who severed his life's thread, Anna Angel. Remember it. Goodbye."
542077, "Quite likely not... It must have been a calculated move. He was afraid that another murder would make his existence in this town impossible."
542078, "Who knows... Maybe it was kindness. Time will tell who's evil and who's good... And we won't have to wait long now. Be patient."
542079, "It was so wonderful... Why is this even happening?"
542080, "You're lying; I can't hear a thing. It's empty and silent, as it always is."
542081, "It may be empty now... but the Bachelor will see to it that it will soon be just as I've described, I promise you that. I for one can hear the screaming already. Don't know about you..."
542082, "I've always said that this Bachelor is a bringer of death!"
542083, "So can I! I always know more than you do."
542084, "May be, may well be..."
542085, "Call for Mark. I need to talk to him."
542086, "*** It didn't work out. I was silly to let it out..."
542087, "Are you telling the truth?"
542088, "I always tell the truth."
542090, "Check for yourself if you don't believe me."
542091, "How come?"
542092, "I can't tell you yet, but I will later. So many things are mixed up here, one doesn't know who to fear more... So you're with the Saburovs now, right? Good... you'll be safe with them, and the children won't hurt you. Here, I've got a present for you."
542093, "No. I prefer to keep clear of beasts..."
542094, "Have you been crying? Don't hold back if you want to cry... It's nothing to be ashamed of."
542095, "*** As ever, my tongue runs ahead of my reasoning! So many times have I promised myself to keep mum; to let the others talk... It wouldn't work anymore, even though it seems there may be a silver lining to this cloud."
542096, "If I have a what?"
542097, "Look. I can work miracles with my own hands."
542098, ""
542099, "You're dropping in quite often now... This is a dangerous place for a girl who doesn't cover her knees. Also, too many temptations here for a saint. And finally, this is as goddamn unfitting a place as any for Lady Plague to be in! Way overcrowded, ha ha... How can I help you?"
542100, "I've brought you some herbs... Take a look and see if they're any good. And give me one of those bottles over there..."
542101, "I've come to like the smell. I enjoy breathing your air."
542102, "Do you intend to hide in here? Pour wine over your dead, play leap-frog with corpses? This debauchery will not be without consequence! Pray..."
542103, "You've acquired a taste, then? I should never have shown you that path... messes too much with a head as young as yours. It's a part of you forever now. Anyway, no need to regret it. What have you got?"
542104, "Don't grin like that. It's not for me."
542105, "I don't regret it. Your herb has no effect on me."
542106, "No! I don't have any medicine. When I was young, I used to play at the house of a wicked witch-now that's who had a real stash, for every disease... She lived for a hundred years. Her place had that pharmacy smell everywhere! Do you take me for someone like that crone? Nonsense!"
542107, "Don't lie to me, Anna. I even know where you keep it. Why are you trying to deceive me?"
542108, "Oh, what a pain... This is surely a plot against me... They want to kill me, destroy my life, send me to an early grave. An early grave, yes... Listen! I don't want some disease to eat me alive, to ruin my skin... Leave me that if nothing else, or just shoot me with a gun!"
542109, "It's not their fault, Anna. It was an order."
542110, "All right, I'll tell the Olgimskys then that you have nothing. Right?"
542111, "Give them at least some of it. Leave the best-looking ones for yourself. I think that's a good idea. Isn't it?"
542112, "Did you say they require blood?"
542113, "Your Ripper, that's who."
542114, "'Our' Ripper? Ah... you mean Young Burakh? Sadly, that's a misconception. I used to think so too. I wanted to get as many twyrine infusions out of him as possible... they're priceless! His father had been a respected man who knew his trade... This one, though, doesn't know a thing."
542115, "Are you sure?"
542116, "Quite. When I brought him to Isidor's workshop, he didn't even know how to use a distiller and just stood there gaping at it. He doesn't know what twyre is. How can someone like that be a knower of root knots and grass fibers? Even the Stamatins by now have more knowledge of herbs than him. Amateurs... the plague take them!"
542117, "Yes, you've convinced me! But there's no need to say it like that. Especially now. It's too... dangerous."
542118, "Right. What about Anna, then?"
542119, "Don't underestimate intuition. He may be following a gut feeling..."
542120, "I was just lucky."
542122, "Is that true?"
542123, "Yes."
542124, "How do you know?"
542125, "So you still haven't realized who I am? Are you not surprised that she gave me all of it so easily?"
542126, "I don't know... But it does feel that way. Why have you suddenly turned so pale?"
542127, "But you knew it as early as yesterday... didn't you? Was that why you sent me to that uncanny place with the old necromancer and his niece?"
542128, "This is not a request. It is an ordainment. What made you reconsider?"
542129, "I've concluded that no evil can come from decisions that I make. So I will make decisions."
542130, "Good. We shall begin with a mysterious creature named Aspity. I will show you where she lives."
542131, "There's no need. I know it all anyway..."
542132, "Seems like fate wants it this way."
542133, "Why her? Who is she?"
542134, "The question is not who, but what. Children say she is an evil spirit. Simon didn't like her. That bitch has been called a walking plague even before this. I'm sure that a woman, a maneater, and a spawn of the Steppe-which is exactly what a shabnak is-is a fitting description for her."
542135, "If so, she's in for it."
542136, "Asps, spite, and spit."
542137, "What is your verdict, then? Is she guilty?"
542138, "Nothing. She has no soul."
542139, "I couldn't decide... But I did feel our souls had something in common!"
542140, "...I saw this coming. Just thinking about the consequences of your alliance sends shivers down my spine... So what now? I suppose your friend will tell you everything herself, especially considering your talents. Or am I getting the wrong idea about the nuances of your cordial relationship?"
542141, "You hate her, don't you?"
542143, "My new father has more important things on his plate than doing you favours!"
542144, "Aha! So they've adopted you? That's symbolic... Well, if not me, how about doing a favour to my father? After all, your-ehm-father is not the governor yet... and hopefully will never be. So Saburov could do with my father owing him a favour."
542145, "She scares me, plain and simple. My father, on the other hand, truly hates her. The fact that she's still alive has made me reconsider how I feel about my father... It turns out he's much kinder than I thought."
542146, "What makes you say that?"
542147, "So what did Aspity do to displease your father so much?"
542148, "*** I lost my temper there for a moment... Where am I supposed to find a bull now? At least, it feels like I did the right thing. Dealing with this Changeling may be bad for one's health..."
542150, "So she's out to destroy your family, but is wiping out the Kin instead?"
542151, "If we knew for sure that she's the one stirring up the Worms, butchers, and workmen, we'd make short work of her. Saburov would not object, nor would Judge Kain take a break from his indifference. But you see, I'm a sensible man... and deep down, I'm convinced she's just an ordinary dirty lowlife."
542152, "Have you met her?"
542153, "Once. Her face left quite an impression and so did her speech. That sing-song drawl, that guttural accent of the Steppe... Fascinating. On the whole, she looked rather uncanny. But I thought back then it was just something she was doing for effect. My sister also thinks she's just a vagabond girl obsessing over demonic dreams."
542154, "Was it a long time ago?"
542155, "What do you mean?"
542156, "Exactly that! Yes, yes... there's a reason things have been going the way they have! And that horrible thing at the Termitary... Yes, she's aimed a battering ram at him that will strike him down any time now. And now she's shifted her attention to me. That's what's happening! Should I warn him...? I don't like this... but he's angry at me..."
542157, "I'll tell him what you said when I get the opportunity."
542158, "I'm often told just that: wrong door. People simply won't believe that I've come to them-at long last..."
542159, "What? Are you trying to be funny?"
542160, "Not in the slightest."
542161, "Are you feeling well?"
542162, "What? What the... Who sent you? Was it Yaklakh?"
542163, "Aspity has set up a trap."
542164, "Yaklakh? Who's that?"
542165, "Hey... Anyone in the hallway? Take this thing away..."
542166, "My family is at the peak of its power now... and you think you can warn me about some danger? Especially when it's from that half-witted beggar?"
542167, "It's what your son wanted me to say..."
542168, "Fat Vlad... Do you think your belly will shield you from death? No-one needs your money, you blind fool!"
542169, "You're in danger. Aspity has set a trap for you!"
542170, "There's no one in the hallway. It's dead quiet. And you-you'll regret this!"
542171, "Crush her? Go ahead and try."
542172, "I don't trust you. Why bother to talk? Hm?"
542173, "We'd be better off together than each on our own."
542174, "Quite the contrary. We'd be much better off on our own than together."
542175, "Would you perhaps like me to do something for you? What could I do to warm you up to me?"
542176, "As you wish... But now I'm offended."
542177, "Ah... so it's money you want, you little informer... I can appreciate that, I really can... So, take this for-heh-saving my life. I'll have a better look at her, then."
542178, "That's better... You'll appreciate me yet."
542179, "Aspity, oh Aspity, I know of you this..."
542180, "Clara darling, have you gone mental? Must be the local air. Happens to outsiders a lot. I'm no 'Aspity'!"
542181, "Saba Usp'tae..."
542182, "Sahba-ötün..."
542183, "Look, that's enough. You're being obnoxious. Are you trying to bewitch me? Would you like to see me try that too-the way I do it with creatures like your little self? Careful, Clara, my child; you may go missing..."
542184, "Don't be cross. I just want to talk..."
542185, "No. I don't. And don't look at me like that..."
542186, "Are you sure you want to make an enemy of me? I'd think twice if I were you... "
542187, "Why, I've made friends with you already... only you don't know it yet. The one I've made friends with, my very own sister, isn't the person to disown our kinship. If you could only get on good terms with her-so could you and I... Oh, just kidding. So what about you, are you not afraid of the shabnak?"
542188, "I am. Shall I perhaps fetch you some spring water?"
542189, "Shall I perhaps fetch you some spring water?"
542190, "I'm not. Would you like me to do anything for you? How can I make you warm up to me?"
542191, "And why are you worried?"
542192, "That's none of your concern."
542193, "I know it myself."
542194, "Are you sleepy? Why are you lowering your eyes?"
542195, "And you're not going to interrupt me?"
542196, "No, I'm not. Speak."
542197, "Sahba-ötün, oh Sahba-ötün, I know of you this: you've fallen in love with this Burakh! Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
542198, "Saba, oh Saba, I know of you this: your greatest desire is to kill Vlad Olgimsky. Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
542199, "There we go, I knew it was a spell... You're an idiot, Clara. Your sister is smarter. Get lost."
542200, "But..."
542201, "Beware of the sister, Aspity dear... She'll come back here as soon as I leave."
542202, "Out."
542203, "All right, I'm leaving."
542204, "Did you... did you cause the epidemic?"
542205, "...The shabnak-adyr exists? Is it you?"
542206, "I see. You may wake up."
542207, "That's what you all say... Let's just make our acquaintance for now."
542208, "Who you are is no secret. It was you that sat on Simon's chest last night. It was you that Isidor had warned him about. Tell me, why were you so cruel to him? Why did you not let him pass away with the same noble and majestic countenance that he had worn among the living?"
542209, "Is this a joke? I'm not death! Don't worry..."
542210, "I am quite unafraid of you. In fact, I even entertain a degree of pity for you. Do you realize how dangerous the walls of our house are to you?"
542211, "Yes. I feel fear and I can't explain it."
542212, "Are you that sure of yourself?"
542213, "Maria is near. Her mere proximity will turn you to ashes once she ascends to the fullness of her powers. And that will be soon. You are probably feeling the pain already... akin to a deadly radiation turning your bones into porous lime... Am I right?"
542214, "Why are you so calm, Kain? Could it be you've planned something cunning against me, you heretic utopians?"
542215, "Is she a witch? I can't think of any other reason for her to hate me... The power that guides the palms of my hands is a benign power. There's no doubt of that."
542216, "Yes... I can feel her proximity destroying me... but I don't believe she'll win."
542217, "Saddened though I am on Simon's account, I am nonetheless not so foolish as to be angry with you. Only a fool would curse and threaten the wind that has torn the sail off his mast. Besides, unlike Georgiy, I profoundly doubt the imminence of your victory."
542218, "I feel sorry for him too... And I feel sorry for all of you. That's easy to understand... But why should you pity me?"
542219, "Yes... wind is sent from heaven. All that matters is not to sail against it."
542220, "I don't know anything about myself either..."
542221, "Because I don't want you to doubt in my good intentions."
542222, "Because I want him to be buried in the earth."
542223, "If you know where Simon's body is being hidden, it ought to look quite suspicious to us. You must have been pursuing your own goals, I suppose; ritual ones. We are not merely talking about a body of a dearly departed. Do you understand that?"
542224, "Are you from the Steppe? I mean, a pagan?"
542225, "No! Quite the contrary..."
542226, "Yes. I want the earth to have her due."
542227, "Of course I do! I know what a semblance is."
542228, "I understand. And so-where is the body?"
542229, "Do you understand the risk I was taking coming here? You were right, you know... about the rays."
542230, "Your words sound wise and quite fair. You evidently know what you are talking about. The destruction of Simon's body would inevitably lead to the destruction of our entire town. But now that the body has been found-we will try and use all of our influence to save the town... one way or another."
542231, "So what do you think I would've done had I been who your crown-bearing daughter thinks I am?"
542232, "Whatever has happened or will happen to Simon is going to impact the universe. That's what you believe."
542233, "So you know already?"
542234, "Like I said, we know everything already. But it is good that you have come. My brother is very angry and prejudiced against you. And as for me, I will now think twice before believing any of the things you are accused of. She who you are being mistaken for would indeed never have given us the body."
542235, "This is making me dizzy... So... you engineered all of this from the very beginning?"
542236, "...Was this a test?"
542237, "No. It's not like this. Take some money. This is all I can do to reward you for now. Aside from trusting you, of course."
542238, "I know, but I can't tell you..."
542239, "You are already the talk of the town. Wicked people are afraid of you. And not just the wicked people. You inspire fear... in many, my dear daughter. "
542240, "Yes. Rather a lot...  All those places to visit. I had to go everywhere. And observe everything."
542241, "Yes... I understand... Will you tell me about it?"
542242, "I don't think I should... I really don't. You don't need to hear about any of that... my dear father and protector!"
542243, "...Are you willing to continue helping me in the future?"
542244, "I can see this is not what you want to ask me about... Has something happened?"
542245, "Are you finding it difficult to talk to me, father? Have I done something to make you angry?"
542246, "...Are some people really afraid of me? Who are they?"
542247, "That doesn't matter. It is for the better. You can see what's going on yourself. Monsters are hatching one after another, each uglier than the one before... You poke your finger anywhere and you squash some abominable spider every time. Is the epidemic spawning them, or did they spawn the epidemic? I don't understand anything anymore."
542248, "...Follow your heart's calling, father. "
542249, "Yes. You're right. A lot of people are getting causes and consequences mixed up now. That's because everything has become a closed loop. They are right."
542250, "What wicked person have you found for me this time?"
542251, "Father... Do you really want me to do something that your own patrolmen can't do? I'm no Judith..."
542252, "I understand that. You must be thinking that I have got myself a personal enemy-an enemy who is challenging the order that it is my present duty to enforce and maintain. I understand. You must be thinking that I want to destroy the thief and mark him with the brand of Jonah. Rest assured that it is not so."
542253, "Why?"
542254, "Why would they do that? With the... corpses, I mean?"
542255, "They probably wanted to hide the bodies. Which can only indicate that the thieves had a hand in those people's deaths."
542256, "...Do you think they deliberately infected people?"
542257, "Why look for it? We know where Grief's quarters are..."
542261, "Who could know things about him? You know... things. He won't open up unless I catch his soul with a hook."
542262, "I don't know. Olgimsky surely knows something, but he will say nothing. Think. Do your own research."
542263, "I'll try... I think I know who that could be..."
542264, "I don't think I can do it. I don't know anyone around here..."
542265, "No... I'll be the one who restores order here."
542266, "What? What did you find out?"
542267, "Grief is not the mastermind. He really did prohibit murdering. The killers are being incited by a different man, known as Barley the Barber..."
542268, "What about me... don't you care at all?"
542269, "If it's true we need to inform the Bachelor immediately. He seems about to try to snatch Wolf's glory from under his nose."
542270, "I'm glad you are unhurt, Clara. But I also know that you'll never come to any harm, however things might turn out... Such is your preordainment."
542271, "That's true. Still, I'm terribly scared."
542272, "...And what's your preordainment, father? What's Grief's? Why do you even need me for if you know things that are hidden from me?"
542273, "Enough... We'll discuss that later. Now to the business at hand. I need to send a messenger to Wolf at once."
542274, "See this sack? I stole it from Barley's lair... Take it. It's very heavy. And wet..."
542275, "...Look."
542276, "It's Wolf's head... The sergeant in charge of the operation. The one who first found out about the killers' secret meeting..."
542277, "Well? Fine parcel, eh?"
542278, "Barley killed him. He's the real leader of the barber gang."
542279, "(...fancy that, this one isn't afraid of me either... not that it counts for much since he's just too dumb to be afraid.)"
542280, "I will stay here even after I leave. Will you solve my riddle?"
542281, "That was just me being concerned about you... Take your time and think a little, then I'll ask you again."
542282, "But why don't you ask Grief yourself? You know where he lives. Bring him in and question him... why do you need me?"
542283, "The wily lowlife is denying everything... He feigned fear and pretended to have had nothing to do with it. He acted his part so well that he even raised the alarm himself! And yet I'm sure it's Grief who is inciting the killers, as well as buying up their victims' stolen belongings. Ask him if it's true. I am sure it is."
542284, "Don't you have a way to loosen his tongue?"
542285, "That is not all. I suspect that Grief enjoys the Olgimskys' protection... in exchange for giving them kickbacks from his illicit trade in twyrine. Should Vlad take offence, I would prefer to face him fully armed. Ask Grief if it's true. I would like to know everything about him... before he's dealt with."
542287, "I'll ask."
542288, "I don't understand."
542289, "I've set up a trap for Grief. Sergeant Wolf found out that the killers' ringleader had called up a meeting at a certain secret location. All that remains is to discover that location, and we'll catch Grief red-handed. The ringleader is none other than him. It cannot be anyone else."
542290, "Actually, I haven't asked him yet... Because, you see, it was he who sent me to you, to intercede on his behalf!"
542291, "I don't know about your judgement, father-but mine has to be fair and impartial!"
542292, "So am I to tell Grief you're not going to go after him today?"
542293, "...Have you talked to it already? What did it tell you? Did you remember to ask it about... yourself?"
542294, "I don't believe a single word it said! But it said that I'm the plague... Which I don't believe. Don't disown me, please!"
542295, "How could I have asked him about my own holiness? It's a sin... I mustn't. But you do believe me, don't you?"
542296, "I don't even know where to begin..."
542297, "He deserves to die."
542298, "I knew that. Who do we send to him, then? An entire squad has been massacred by the barbers..."
542299, "Spare yourself the trouble... father. It's all been arranged already."
542300, "Begin with the Olgimskys. That is the most important sin for me, and the least for him, for it is not his fault. So did Olgimsky protect his illicit trade? Did he benefit from it?"
542301, "He didn't just benefit; he presided over it. Grief was his stooge."
542302, "Now then, we shall skip the issue of the barber gang, since it's clear now who their true mastermind was... thanks to your courage, my brave girl."
542303, "I won't be able to tell for certain until I've asked Vlad himself..."
542304, "Don't skip it just yet. Barley was as much of a puppet in Grief's hands as Grief himself was for Olgimsky. Everyone has their toys."
542305, "...Yes, let's skip it."
542306, "And I was beginning to regret my bias! It seems I shouldn't have... Well, that settles it."
542307, "Aren't you interested to know what my verdict is? Whether Grief is the cause of the disaster that's struck us?"
542308, "Well... Is he the cause of the disaster that has struck the town? What's your verdict?"
542309, "So what would you say about him?"
542310, "Covered in blood from head to toe! He may look like one of us-but I'm convinced that he's not human. He was spawned by the abyss. An evil spirit's will is behind his actions!"
542311, "Leave him alone. I'll put an end to his misdeeds in due time."
542312, "Because I've decided that today shall see the end of any and all killers who use scalpels, razors, knives, barber scissors, or any other manner of blades. The epidemic mowing down human lives is bad enough on its own. The streets will be safe-in daytime as well as at nighttime!"
542313, "The Haruspex is not one to get caught easily..."
542314, "I know where his lair is."
542315, "Indeed? Where is it?"
542316, "In a factory building by the railway."
542317, "There's no one there. Wolf and his squad swept all suspicious areas along the railway tracks. Including the Works."
542318, "That's odd..."
542319, "I don't know. So this Haruspex is going to walk into an ambush as he gets home..."
542320, "Is Rubin really there?"
542321, "No. No one knows where Rubin is. The Kains dispatched about a hundred men; they've been searching for him since yesterday, turning half the town inside out, but he's still nowhere to be found. I, however, am going to search the other half... and I have the feeling I will succeed. Then the Kains will understand who they're dealing with."
542322, "And is it true? About Rubin?"
542323, "And this Haruspex, is he-"
542324, "I just wanted to say that there's an ambush laid for you. Don't go home today..."
542325, "So that's how it is... Then I suppose you don't at all care about who's waiting for you back at home!"
542326, "Really? Who laid it? "
542327, "I doubt it's a pleasant visitor. Whoever it is, someone knowing where I live is no good news. Or is it Young Olgimsky?"
542328, "Alexander Saburov, my adoptive father, detests you. For no good reason, I'd say."
542329, "Thank you... what was your name again?"
542330, "No. Not Young Olgimsky. It's Rubin."
542331, "What? Rubin? You talked to him?"
542332, "Yes, him. Young Olgimsky."
542333, "Then he can go to hell. Chap's got nothing but money on his mind."
542334, "...While you've got nothing but blood on yours, eh? You're really thick, Haruspex. Or are you too busy to stop and take a more thorough look at me?"
542335, "...What? Why on earth would I do that for?"
542336, "Because I am you. Except I'm always a step ahead of you. In everything."
542337, "You see... I like you."
542338, "Go away, Changeling. Got enough on my plate without you."
542339, "How rude! Don't go home tonight. You'll remember my words later."
542340, "That was a joke. Rubin is who's waiting for you back home. He'll have yet more to add to your plate."
542341, "How should I put it... Well, I did."
542342, "No. I found out by chance."
542343, "Is he... plotting revenge?"
542344, "Alexander Saburov, my adoptive father, detests you. I share the sentiment, but I don't want to be part of anything underhanded."
542345, "I'm a trifle tired, I am... Eh well, my life's barely begun-and it's almost lights out time already... Questions! Who's got time for that! Oh no, I ain't angry at all... just tired. 'Tis all because of 'em questions. You agree to answer one, and a bit of your life's blood escapes with the answer. With the anger. Anger is our life's blood, lil' pimple..."
542346, "I feel sorry for you... You must be in pain."
542347, "Whoa, whoa! Who are you to feel sorry for me, you lil' tot? Eh? I won't tolerate anyone's pity, I've got my own pity to spare. Ain't you a kind lil' lass, a loving lil' one... Makin' me go all soft on you... eh? Where did the anger go? No anger in sight, none at all... heh heh."
542348, "There's a reason for that, Grief. We are alike, you and I. Our paths have crossed for a reason."
542349, "And do you know there's going to be a manhunt for you?"
542350, "Bah... old news. Dontcha teach a cook in his own kitchen, all right? They'll end up grabbin' the wrong man. The Bachelor-more like the Bitchelor!-wouldn't put in a word for me, so perhaps you will help out, what with you being the Saburovs' new little sweetie? Tell him I had nothin' to do with it, will you?"
542351, "He won't believe me. He's too angry with you. He doesn't answer to anyone, so there's a lot of rancour in him..."
542352, "Better tell me why there are thugs posted around your warehouse, standing there twiddling their knives."
542353, "How else do we defend ourselves against Barley the Cunt? Son of a bitch's lured all my men away from me, promisin' carnage. Those animals didn't go over to his side for the plunder; just out of sheer blood-fuckin'-lust! And who do I have left? There, go ahead, feast your eyes: my loyal faithful; that's the lot. Eh, one gets what one gets! As they say, beggars can't be choosers..."
542354, "Why are you hiding your eyes? Don't you know I have the gift of seeing through any lie?"
542355, "Cut the braggin', thief darlin'! A gift like that spells early death, y'know. Must be the reason Saburov took you in, you poor lil' soul... So you can see through any lie, eh? How about seein' the fact that I haven't taken a single life, none at all?"
542356, "Am I supposed to just make up that 'truth' or what?"
542357, "They do call me a thief, and I am one-but I'm not that kind of thief! I don't steal truth."
542360, "I was going to anyway..."
542361, "Sure, go on. Whaddya wanna know? Just do me a favour and skip the mumbo jumbo part."
542362, "...Filin, oh Filin, I know of you this: you are the real ringleader of the killers! Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?"
542363, "...Yeah. I'm the real boss... I was lucky Barley came along at the right time... let me cover my tracks 'n shift the blame 'n get off scot-free... The Bachelor never got my number..."
542364, "What did you need it all for?"
542365, "...For 'tis my soul's desire. This... killin' urge. It's just that... my hand was itchin'... for some jolly funtime..."
542366, "That's not for you to judge! After all that I've found out..."
542367, "A blow with a big blunt stick in a dark alley, that's nice and clean, it is, especially when it's not from behind... with a knife, there's even a bit of gallantry in it... especially when it's not your own knife... What do we look like on the inside? Eh? Whadyathink? No one wants to drag that out in the open... that would be scary, heh heh... that would be givin' away the secret..."
542368, "What secret?"
542369, "Look, here I am, standing in front of you, flesh and blood. See a stamped paper? Thought not."
542370, "Now tell me about the Olgimskys. Have they been protecting your shady business?"
542371, "Fat Vlad's the real man, 'tis he who's runnin' the market... The young one's clueless... It was he that ordered the black twyrine too... his own doin'..."
542372, "And the final question, Grief. Where exactly did you dump the bodies into the river?"
542373, "...That wasn't us... I know, I know the whole chant with them stiffs... but that was the Worms from the Termitary, 'n I got the blame... I know nothin'... 'tis not my scope of murder, not my style, I swear to God... poisonin' all the water, that's just... gruesome..."
542374, "All right. Tell me, was Olgimsky acting in collusion with you?"
542375, "I don't believe in magic, Grief. I can't be affected by it. Something's wrong here..."
542376, "It depends. Which one? There's more than one Olgimsky, you know! Heh heh... One might have, and the other one might not have. That's why you can't bring them down. One hand takes and the other gives... The right hand floggeth whom the left hand caresseth... Heh heh heh... There's your answer."
542377, "Grief, were you aware of the coming epidemic?"
542378, "I don't get it..."
542379, "Well, we did figure it out... Eventually. You see, black twyrine had been used as medicine during the first outbreak-and this time around the trade got really hectic 'n all... But those who'd ordered it must have known, probably as far back as summer... Heh heh..."
542380, "And... who had ordered it?"
542381, "You know the answer. Who were you just askin' about?"
542382, "The elder or the younger?"
542383, "I don't know..."
542384, "Like you ever would, lil' pimple. That's it. 'Nough questions. Gonna grab some rest now. I'm really tired... You go away, nothin' for you to see here anymore... What, you liked my answers, didncha? Oh you tot... Heh heh..."
542385, "Ugh! You'll regret this, Grief!"
542386, "I'll ask you more questions later... and the way I'll ask them, you won't be able to dodge the answers anymore..."
542387, "That's it, question time's over. Two Olgimskys for the price of one was already stretchin' it. Heh heh heh..."
542388, "Wait a minute! There's something I don't understand..."
542389, "You're a cruel monster, a ghoul! Any Ripper is a lamb compared to you!"
542390, "...I am you... so go easy on the righteous fuss, will you? You and I are very similar... our paths have crossed for a reason..."
542391, "Were you selling your black twyrine yourself?"
542392, "...So that's why Saburov didn't want to arrest you at once."
542393, "...He's lyin'. 'Tis not Olgimsky he's afraid of, it isn't... Think bigger..."
542394, "That's right, you're one of Simon's Bound! But... why?"
542395, "I think I've sensed it..."
542396, "Being my friend is dangerous, Notkin. Take your time and get a closer look at me."
542397, "What had the people you threw into the river died of?"
542398, "Don't you dare mention God, you scum!"
542399, "What?"
542400, "Simon liked me... Or am I not one of your Bound anymore? Forgotten, have you? Ain't you a forgetful lil' tot... Like being dead can stop Simon from prohibiting things... from tellin' you what to do and what not to..."
542402, "What? Who said that?"
542403, "That's what I'm asking."
542404, "Hell knows... Violence has always been their thing. But cutting people up with knives and razors... that's neither his style nor his level of courage. I don't think he'd allow that. He may be a vicious bastard, but he has his limits. No stabbing and slicing, period. Everyone feels this way."
542405, "But somebody is stabbing and slicing..."
542406, "Saburov."
542407, "You know, we too can beat a bloke silly. But knives are taboo. Whoever uses one is less than human; a cancerous growth! Grief is not like that."
542408, "All right, you've convinced me. But do you think he might have caused the epidemic?"
542409, "Little-known, you say? How do you know it then?"
542410, "We know everything-we're close by and have a nose for these things! That's what he hates us for, that bloody Filin! So this black twyrine, it's kind of sinister. Why are they so hush-hush about it? It's not like twyrine trade hasn't been around for a while. The whole town knows. And now there's this..."
542411, "Is Filin his last name?"
542412, "Grigory Filin, that's what he's called. It was shortened to Grief eventually, and 'Bad Grief' is his own invention. To sound bigger than he is, I guess."
542413, "I see..."
542414, "Black twyrine! Do you think the disease has been spreading through it?"
542415, "I don't know, father... How could I know? I'm no scientist..."
542416, "Come closer, my daughter. Tell me-advise me-what measures must be taken to stop the epidemic? Where do we send our brave patrolmen and the Executor suicide squads?"
542417, "That's not for me to decide, father! My advice would be of little use here."
542418, "There is nothing wrong with your saying this. I am thinking aloud, and I would like to know whether the harbinger agrees with me. For there is someone else speaking through your lips-is there not?"
542419, "Yes. There is."
542420, "That is my job to do. Do not worry about that. To be the ruler during a plague is a cursed part to play and a grievous burden: a man doomed to nothing but error. Yes, all of those measures are just a way to comfort ourselves. My only hope is you. I hope you have not allowed despair to take over you yet. Do I need to restate my request?"
542421, "It's not contagious.. One falls ill when one's time comes, and it notices him... It is then that the disease aims its jagged spear at a man."
542422, "All of these measures mean nothing. Send some of them to the Cathedral, and some to the cemetery, shovels in hand. That would be my advice."
542423, "Five years ago, the Sand Plague broke out in the poor districts where, due to our negligence, the social and sanitary conditions had become truly appalling. If, like the plague, it is spread by blood-sucking fleas and their host animals, perhaps a culling of bulls and other domestic animals would be the best solution?"
542424, "Why cull bulls? Bulls don't get fleas; they aren't a threat."
542425, "I will tell you what I'm going to do. Don't say a word to anyone about the plague! I refuse to allow a panic, and so I will ban all expressions of mourning. Let them celebrate instead. To the Bachelor, I have recommended that he reassure sick people, saying they have been afflicted with a 'general condition'"
542426, "As you wish."
542427, "Rats-that's who you ought to exterminate without mercy! There should be a reward for every rat killed."
542428, "Let no one talk about the Sand Plague for as long as possible. Now if anyone attempts to escape and is heard saying that the disease is incurable and a pair of boots is the best medicine, that person must be taken into custody. Is that something you would endorse?"
542429, "You're looking for the cause in the wrong place."
542430, "There's already talk of the Sand Plague at every street corner. Aren't these measures coming a little late?"
542431, "Yes. I would. But do you really think this will be enough?"
542432, "I had the same impression."
542433, "Was it her? The shabnak-adyr?"
542434, "Ah, I don't know... it just looked somehow... off. Just like the kind of creature that the Earth would make. The Earth doesn't know what we really look like... It can't create a woman that no one would tell apart from a real living one... can it? I, too, used to think it was a girl with a pair of sharp bones for legs..."
542435, "What made you think it was miserable?"
542436, "Its face... And just everything about it. It wants to speak to you. It pleads for protection from some danger."
542437, "Ah, if only this were the real shabnak-adyr! That would put an end to the meaningless lie about me having a sister! I could finally become myself again and live peacefully! So you're saying it's not dangerous?"
542438, "Why are you shivering, Grace dear? You're not one to be afraid of the dead. Why would you be frightened by some bones?"
542439, "All of my dead were once alive. They may be dead, but they're human... And this, the thing that came to me-it's impossible. It's a real..."
542440, "A real what?"
542441, "Could it be a trap? Perhaps this demon seeks to punish me for the things I've done for my new family."
542442, "Have you talked to it?"
542443, "No, I haven't. I was terribly frightened... And I don't think it spoke either... but when I listened closer I realized that the strange humming in my ears was a voice muttering from somewhere... as if from under the ground, in fact. I couldn't make out the words, but somehow I understood..."
542444, "Understood what?"
542445, "...So my father has failed... Why is everything my father does always so pointless?"
542446, "No. I don't. Who am I?"
542447, "Of course I know. I am Clara, a thief, and possibly God's chosen one. There's no other explanation for the miracles I've performed."
542448, "...Are you the shabnak-adyr?"
542449, "No... Who says 'shabnak-adyr'? You're saying it wrong... you have to say 'shabnak-adyg'-there's less evil this way."
542450, "You haven't answered my question."
542451, "I was made from your leftovers... I was made for you... I am you... I exist so you could see things clearer..."
542452, "Are you making fun of me?"
542453, "Tell me... is it true that I'm the plague-spreader?"
542454, "The cemetery caretaker's daughter said you were in danger. Why?"
542455, "Because you are in danger..."
542456, "What's the danger?"
542457, "All right. I'll do everything..."
542458, "Lies-lies are the true infection devouring everything around! I understand that now..."
542459, "...Do you understand now why everything hinges on you? Remember what I've told you..."
542460, "No. I still don't understand..."
542461, "I do."
542462, "Farewell... funny man..."
542463, "No matter what I've undertaken lately, my senses keep failing me! It's as if I were replaced by a double... why?"
542464, "...What? You're asking me?"
542465, "No... Of course not. I was just thinking aloud."
542466, "What, you've been convicted?"
542467, "Quit it. I'm telling you, I want to be alone. And you're the last person I'd like to see."
542468, "All right. I'll leave in a moment."
542469, "*** Curse the Bachelor! Every time I see him I break out in a cold sweat!"
542470, "*** Beyond doubt, they are trying to seduce me. Who knows what would happen if I were to give way to this temptation."
542471, "'...Bring this Сhangeling to me without delay. Her case must be investigated immediately and she must be court-martialled.

Still, the offer is standing. It's up to you... no matter how painful it is for me to accept. I find solace in the fact that I can end the previous sentence with 'for now.'/n/nA. Lilich, inq"
542476, "The Inquisitor's Note"
542477, "This Aglaya Lilich has installed some kind of a tyranny in the town. She failed to carry out the task she was entrusted with. She gave shelter to both of the demons. She has appropriated the fruit of someone else's labour and travestied someone else's accomplishments. As if this is not enough, she acts as if she were a conqueror standing atop the ruins of the enemy town! This has to be stopped./n/nYou should approach her directly and demand an answer-just like she demanded an answer from you. Try it, Clara, don't be afraid... Who knows what may come of this?/n/nYour Benefactors"
542478, "The Powers That Be, Regarding Aglaya Lilich"
542479, "And where is he? The Haruspex? I wish I could talk to him..."
542480, "He's here at the Termitary. I'm looking for him myself... because of a different matter, though. Could it be the folks here who supplied him with that blood? What do you think?"
542481, "Anything is possible... Ask him."
542482, "But what does Rubin have to do with it?"
542483, "Have you seen the Bachelor? We expected him to come here but we probably missed each other... He's the one that talked to Rubin; I haven't seen him for five days... I wasn't sure he was even alive. Georgiy wanted to off him."
542484, "Georgiy has pardoned him."
542485, "I'll look for the Bachelor."
542486, "For what?"
542487, "We assumed responsibility for the town at an inopportune time... We'll see. Perhaps the Inquisitor will handle it better... Meanwhile, think about ways to reach a compromise with him... Maybe you'll be able to explain to him that our intentions have been entirely good."
542488, "I'll try."
542489, "I don't think I'll manage to do that."
542490, "So this man... is he alive and well?"
542491, "They thanked you. Called you a benefactor."
542492, "Alive today, gone tomorrow... You'll run out of those flasks before you know it."
542493, "You're the evil spirit! You may look human, but I know what you really are-a demon! A possessed demon! You're being controlled by something different, from the other side! Goodbye."
542494, "*** This is not the right way to talk to them! I was confused! Mistakes were made..."
542495, "What makes you think I do?"
542496, "You're similar. You both live for the sake of the dead... Or am I wrong?"
542497, "You're both kind souls, almost blessed fools... just like me, I suppose. I sense people who are like that."
542498, "You're probably right... But if you're so sharp and observant, why don't you talk to Grace herself?"
542499, "Why would you put it like that? A 'kind soul' is not the same as a kind person... You're crafty after all! You seem to say perfectly good things-but they're actually quite backhanded. You've probably got something like that in store for Grace too... don't you?"
542500, "I'd feel rather awkward..."
542501, "I barely know Grace; we haven't spoken a lot. Do you want to make friends with her?"
542502, "Sorry! I'm sorry! My words often come out crippled. I'm bad at expressing how I feel."
542503, "Of course I do!"
542504, "Katerina is a friend of hers... She needs to know."
542505, "Lara, you're not listening to me at all."
542506, "*** It didn't work out... I am too short-tempered for my own good! Why, oh why did I have to say this?"
542507, "*** There you have it. Whatever happens, human lives must not be sacrificed for the common well-being!"
542508, "*** I am unable to speak to the old man properly. He plays his words so deftly that I can't escape the feeling I am being led into a trap."
542509, "Yes, I too think that this is terribly sad... Have I told you I used to be afraid of it? I thought it was the Albino who had brought the Sand Plague to us. The shabnak-adyr... It's certainly made of clay, sticks, and ground bone. There's no doubt about that."
542510, "But now it's clear that there's nothing to be afraid of... is there?"
542511, "So why do you trust it?"
542512, "There's no wickedness in it. Or anything else. It's hollow, like that skull on a fence. Is it true that it came for you?"
542513, "It is. Which is why I must talk to it. How could we arrange that? The Bachelor didn't shoot it dead, did he?"
542514, "I don't know. I have no desire to meet it! One doppelganger is quite enough!"
542515, "How do you know its route?"
542516, "I know everything that has to do with the unliving-and it's not of the living. When the unliving are offended, they always leave by that path... Into the Steppe. Forever."
542517, "Poor Albino! Well, perhaps I'll still manage to meet it..."
542518, "Don't act surprised!"
542519, "Impossible! I warned them not to kill anyone but Earthkin, the butchers and the Worms enslaved by the wicked Haruspex!"
542520, "They did mean to, Maria... but I beat them to the punch."
542521, "Yes, Maria, I'm afraid... How is a feeble child like me to take on a demon? For I know he is a demon. Obsession equals possession."
542522, "That cannot be... Fear is not your kind of emotion; or else what good of a Mistress are you? In any case, I will repay you; there will be rewards. Unless perhaps you would prefer doing me the occasional small favour to strengthen our soon-to-be... bond."
542523, "Maria, oh Maria... Nothing will bond me to you, nothing ever."
542524, "No... I just wanted to tell you that-I'm going. I'm going to go and do your bidding, you see? Which makes you the one who ought to be afraid."
542525, "A petty rat who thinks itself a puppetmaster... I'll yet see a theatre purer than you're even capable of imagining!"
542526, "*** Mistake! A bad mistake! For this kind of a creature, a name would mean much more than simple definition... Saying her name would have granted me the power to control her."
542527, "I'm not yet sure I'll want to accept that title."
542528, "Don't say that... father! And forgive me like I've forgiven you."
542529, "A Mistress is not a title. Once you have crossed a certain line, you become the person everything hinges upon. How you will use this gift is a different matter. But you are no longer in a position to refuse it. So what disposition are you going to make of our town?"
542530, "Do you have any parting advice to give me?"
542531, "I don't want to use that gift. I'm just leaving."
542532, "You are truly a saint... Or could my reason be so clouded with grief that I fail to hear the sarcasm in your voice? No, I wouldn't want to think so. Do you really want to hear a few behests from me?"
542533, "Yes. I'll do what you weren't able to do, father. After all, the adverse fortunes that marred your brief tenure as a ruler were quite extraordinary..."
542534, "...I was joking, of course. You'd probably be no better as an advisor than you were as a ruler."
542535, "Then I will be concise. First: find someone among the Kains or the Olgimskys on whom you could rely as on yourself. Let them preside over the Bull Project, let them send reports to the Сapital! Metropolitan bureaucrats are the greatest menace. They doze off when the freight trains arrive on schedule-but wake up the moment something goes wrong."
542536, "Why is that a threat for us?"
542537, "Ha ha! So everything's been all right until now? I'm sure the bureaucrats still don't know a thing..."
542538, "They will not let us build our life the way it was intended. The brittle magic of our community will be trampled underfoot. Our erstwhile blissful existence will be irrevocably gone. Everything will be completely different. New people will arrive, and the deadening power of the state will lay down its own Law here! Do not let that happen... as we didn't let it happen before."
542539, "Will I be able to do it?"
542540, "You'll do fine! You'll devote yourself to other things; you'll be spinning your yarn... While your chosen regent must be cunning. He must learn to mislead them... to mask our distinctiveness... he must not let them redevelop the North-East Line any further east than the Gorkhon estuary... He must be cautious!"
542541, "I understand, father. You're tired. You need some rest now."
542542, "I know what to do. Those who favour hard logic and direct action are bound to be misguided. But I can work miracles. And my hands are untied."
542543, "Poor thing, your eyes are all swollen... Have you been crying?"
542544, "Look at me, Anna. You're afraid, aren't you?"
542545, "Look at me, Clara! Why did I chance to cross your path? What do you think? Could it be so that I could sing an ode to fear and give you a vivid example of what that leads to?"
542546, "Are bureaucrats that easy to mislead?"
542547, "Of course, damn it! We've always been misleading them! Our great advantage is that they don't take us seriously. As far as they're concerned, we are a factory and a railway junction. Beyond that, they know nothing-see, even the Inquisitor hasn't learned everything."
542548, "Just like that? Really?"
542549, "That one's a hopeless fool."
542550, "Of course! Should an inspector arrive, take them to the Town Hall at once. Say that the Abattoir is out of operation, and quarantine the Termitary-whatever is going on inside it. If they want to take a stroll around the town, take them to the Chine. And the Polyhedron? Tell him it's a temporary obelisk. A fairground attraction!"
542551, "I don't know how to talk to bureaucrats..."
542552, "That's not misleading at all. It's precisely that."
542553, "Why are you talking like that all of a sudden? What's the matter with you? Or is someone hiding behind that curtain over there?"
542554, "Would you say that's why you've ended up among the wicked?"
542555, "Of course it is. You've understood everything already... What does the Caravan have to do with it? A children's bogeyman, one of those silly stories they tell each other after dark... Maybe it never existed. Maybe I never was with the Caravan... Take a look at me; how could I possibly have been a singer?"
542556, "So you're a liar too..."
542557, "I am an embodiment of fear. I live in a world that's made of fear entirely. I may not have become a singer, but I've become the voice of Fear. And fear has an unpleasant voice... shrill, whiny, capricious, utterly unmusical..."
542558, "So, if you're like that, why did our paths cross?"
542559, "Probably to prevent you from becoming like me. A voice-an entrancing voice, sweet as a dream and beckoning, is what you and I have in common. Do you understand? That's where we intersect! Not the Caravan, not at all! Forget the Caravan!"
542560, "I have already..."
542561, "You, on the other hand, won't stop thinking about it! You're hiding something, Anna! You're still hiding something. What is this Caravan? How did it get here?"
542562, "Ask the Powers That Be. You've paid them a visit already, haven't you? They'll tell you... what the plague is for and what the Caravan is for. It's their games!"
542563, "Fair enough, fair enough... Which means it's not all that important in the end."
542564, "So... is it going to hurt a lot? When is my turn?"
542565, "Would you like to be the first or the last?"
542566, "I don't know. But I think not. A brief moment of pain, and then you'll attain the eternal life, dissolving in a multitude of hearts."
542567, "...Last. Or not-I suppose it's better to get it over with at once! No, wait... I'll tell you later, all right? Better still, just sneak in unnoticed sometime. Will you? Maybe it's better if we do it that way?"
542568, "Maybe. I'll come after you forget about this."
542569, "Goodbye, Anna."
542570, "I don't want you to bow to me."
542571, "Not out of fear, I hope?"
542572, "Out of love, lil' tot... Pure love, all white 'n crunchy like freshly starched linen 'n all... C'mon, think about it: who do I got to go fearin'? No one. For, as you've most correctly guessed, I ain't feared Barley too. 'N the fear, you'd ask? Just for show. Although I do fear myself, I suppose..."
542573, "That's true. We have no one to fear except ourselves."
542574, "...Have you really changed so much? Then for this alone, these twelve days have been worth living."
542575, "Back then, y'see, you figured out the sheer scale of my nastiness, just how much of a villain I was, didntcha? And then you just froze in place-'n my heart sank 'n I thought, so much for ever being forgiven. That's a lil' tot that's gonna condemn me. But you didn't-you forgave me; and I was never the same again. I'd be happy to give my life for you now! I swear to God 'n my own accord!"
542576, "Happy? Honestly?"
542577, "Good. Your atonement will be your salvation. Wait for me to come for you."
542578, "You won't find a more faithful servant from now on, no ma'am! For I have repented. All my cutthroats would die for you too! What is your command, Mistress? My life for you! Me-becomin' like Simon-could I even have imagined...? But even the old man could never become someone like you."
542579, "Please! Stop talking like that!"
542580, "Eh... Who are we when you come to think about it? What are we? A bunch of walking corpses, we are, condemned to death the moment we're born; a bunch of dolls in the hands of the powers that be. Eh? And you two, you're the real humans. But he, Simon, was a proud human, y'see? 'Twas for our sake that he'd made himself into what he was... And you, holy dove; you have surpassed him-for our sake as well."
542581, "Have I really? We don't know that yet."
542582, "Don't say things like that! It's the kind of talk that leads one astray."
542583, "Repent, repent... You've all still got time to see if your new sentiment is sincere."
542584, "You're making fun of me, right? That's not good. You shouldn't..."
542585, "Do you have any... parting words for me? You're an observer of people-so what do your calculations indicate?"
542586, "Wait. Give yourself a moment's pause. Are you sure you want to know what my research has yielded? You see.. whether or not you take my calculations seriously, the moment you learn the results you will have no choice but to act them out. This is merely my way of seeing the matter, though.... So, what do you say? Would you like to set off this trip-wire of mine?"
542587, "I do. It won't do me any harm. In my humble opinion."
542588, "...Actually, you know what? No. I don't want to. You're right."
542589, "You remain an indefinite value. As such, you have walked the road that lies behind you. Your refusal to be categorised was your strongest weapon. However, this advantage will be stripped from you as soon as you permutate into a constant. And, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if that happens before the day is over. What kind of a value you will become? That's the only actual choice you have."
542590, "I'm not Constance. I'm Clara."
542591, "This is of no importance. Don't try to translate your perplexity into a language that is legible to us. Cease this wordplay of yours. Didn't you see everyone disappear? You won't see anything but raw vectors now, lines along which your effort may be applied... Well, really... "
542592, "Why did our paths cross, Yulia? Why are you one of the criminals and the wicked?"
542593, "I don't qualify as wicked, but you can call me criminal... in a way. Just don't conflate the two.  You see, I am of the opinion that it was your duty to end us. Didn't I just tell you, there are no people anymore? Symbols is all that we have left. We all represent opportunities that you have missed... the nine ways to get swallowed by the deathly quagmire."
542594, "I don't like you! I find you even worse than Grief!"
542595, "What?"
542596, "You should be grateful to me for having replaced you. Otherwise it would have been you-and not me-to rot in this desolate place I am consigned to. You would have been left hanging by your strings..."
542597, "I'd have been glad to trade places with you. But I wasn't given the choice!"
542598, "You wanted to rule over people's fates too... I understand."
542599, "Oh, but you were! Let me remind you how intrinsically evil people are. The very nature of you-is evil. You were given exactly as much choice as was necessary for you to affirm your malevolent selfhood. It is not too late yet. Let go of yourself and you will fall even lower than I have fallen... lower than any of us, the nine sinners, from which you will pick the righteous seven."
542600, "Enough. There's no evil in this world... and no need to be afraid anymore."
542601, "No. I'm pure and devoid of evil. I will make my own choice."
542602, "I see what you're getting at!"
542603, "What's on your mind, Lara?"
542604, "Rue not what is to come, for it is a blessing."
542605, "Oh... Nothing really... Tell me, how much life-giving blood will you be able to make from me? How many doses will it be?"
542606, "No less than a hundred and fifty, I believe. And according to Rubin, anything up to five hundred."
542607, "I don't know, Lara. Time will tell. Isn't it the same to you?"
542608, "Of course, of course... Even one would be quite enough. It's something to rejoice in."
542609, "Yes, to rejoice in."
542610, "Oh... that's a lot. Even in a lifetime of relentless activity, I could never have saved or... or created that many people."
542611, "Lara, Lara... Why you too? How did you of all people end up among the wicked?"
542612, "You mean given birth to? I thought it wasn't something you wanted."
542613, "Self-sacrifice is something one must go about competently. I was incompetent."
542614, "That's just nonsense!"
542615, "Simon failed too. That's why you're making the decisions and not him... Or are you him now?"
542616, "Are you raving?"
542617, "No one is more similar than you and Simon. Even we, the Bound, are mere playthings, while you are Humans. With a capital H. Such as I could never have given birth to even if I had got married."
542618, "Did you want to?"
542619, "Sort of... Not really, but I'd often think about it at night. No point in hiding my sins anymore. But that was all a pipe dream. Go ahead, do what you must. Poor thing, I'm so sorry for you. I wouldn't want to carry your burden. Terrifying to bear, yet it would be wrong to refuse it."
542620, "Please, that's no sin at all! You deserve solace."
542621, "Yes. I'd gladly have taken your place. But I can't refuse to play my terrifying part anymore."
542622, "Even if you knelt before me, you'd still be towering over me."
542623, "And you, Foreman Oyun... Why have you crossed my path? It's no coincidence, I know."
542624, "I am a monster, Mistress. A chimera. You were right when you called such humanlike, double-natured beings demons. It is good that you'll destroy me with your magic hands. The evil I stand for will go down with me. It's unnatural to be double-natured."
542625, "...Your grandfather was a bull, wasn't he? "
542626, "True. You can see yourself that my bloodline must be terminated. Evil channels through me, as it does through your counterparts. Someone dark had been stirring behind their backs before you came along and took charge. Now that dark soul is no longer with them, and you ought to drive them out. Don't let them loose."
542627, "Have no fear, I won't."
542628, "We'll see... Something's wrong here, I can feel it. "
542629, "That was a quick and easy surrender... for someone so strong!"
542630, "I've always known I would bow down to no man. Yes, everything points to this being her at whose hands I shall be dealt my doom. Small. Frail. Young... This is what a true Mistress of the Earth looks like."
542631, "That's good. It's good that meeting me has curbed your pride. "
542632, "I haven't accepted the title yet. "
542633, "For as long as you're alive, you'll remain the Mistress. It's I who bow to you."
542634, "Don't talk like that, mother-as if I were a stranger to you."
542635, "Heed my final advice, dear daughter... Be smart. Don't repeat my mistakes! You will not be alone here. Maria is ascending to the fullness of her powers-right now, at the same time as you-whilst Capella, the tardy one, will take a few more years to awaken. Do you understand what this means?"
542636, "No, not quite... What?"
542637, "Maria will not awaken. And Capella... I don't think she will either."
542638, "A period of your antagonism with Maria is beginning. Along what lines will it be? Which of you will be the good one, and which one wicked? Will it be up to the Kains once again to determine the meaning of good and evil? How are you to take the good path if Maria doesn't choose the evil one...?"
542639, "Why divide everything into good and evil right away? Could that have been your mistake? Our mistake..."
542640, "That was what I thought-when I chose my own dark path... I thought the conflict was not between good and evil, that neither good nor evil existed... That wasn't true! For it is in the nature of humans to translate even a dichotomy of red and green into the language of good battling evil. We are doomed to make choices..."
542641, "But did you really choose evil?"
542642, "No, mother... That's not what the ongoing battle is about. Trust me, good and evil do not and will not exist today... Even if the town is laid waste to!"
542643, "I now think I did... Nina could control it at the time... and I couldn't. Nor was Nina wearing the black tiara... But don't put your trust in what is more alluring, more attractive! That is usually where evil lies!"
542644, "And yet I'd still like to ask about my sister... Did she exist-or didn't she? Back then... a week ago?"
542645, "I'll follow your advice, mother."
542646, "What kind of an answer would you like me to give?"
542647, "A truthful one."
542648, "I'd like to know which one of us you loved more... you know?"
542649, "You, daughter... You."
542650, "Goodbye, mother."
542651, "I know... A Mistress cannot lie."
542652, "She didn't, daughter. We had you and you only. You showed up many times, and were different each time..."
542653, "Goodbye, mother."
542654, "I know... A Mistress cannot lie."
542655, "Well... sister. It's time to say our farewells."
542656, "You're the only one I don't feel sorry for. You're a thing. 'A thing that comes in the dark...'"
542657, "So it is... Can't say I'm not glad."
542658, "Why? Everybody's glad to see me."
542659, "What could possibly make me glad to see you? You're my more successful rival. You have become what I couldn't... I'm jealous of you."
542660, "There's nothing to be jealous about, silly! I've gone from a saint to a priestess of blood-a miraculous meat-grinder!"
542661, "Oh yes! I wanted it to be me-me striding across the town in triumph; me going from house to house, carrying death on my black wings; me choosing who deserves retribution... An enviable role, that. But look at what I've become instead-a slave to the Kin, a household familiar, a keeper of relics."
542662, "Tell me, would you like to trade places with me?"
542663, "That's not true! I'm not like that! I chose a different fate for myself..."
542664, "Come on! What's done is done. It's not like one could choose one's fate retroactively, or change that part of it which has already been fulfilled..."
542665, "One could. I can. That's what these things called miracles are about."
542666, "You'll never understand that. That's why you are a mere thing, Aspity. "
542667, "Isn't it something to be proud of?"
542668, "I was saving the seat of power for a worthy successor-but I couldn't save that successor's subjects. You've killed them!"
542669, "I've saved who I could. And I will save even more!"
542670, "Tell me, what's it going to be like-when, you know, the time comes?"
542671, "Why talk like that? You've helped me. Who would I be without you?"
542672, "Do you want the exact details?"
542673, "I'm going to have to settle down here, aren't I?"
542674, "Block is inviting you to come along. He'd like to take you away with his army, right?"
542675, "That's not the issue..."
542676, "Let's get straight to the point. How many years will one person last us?"
542677, "But you can be in both places at once, can't you? Such is your nature. You'll stay here with us forever, and at the same time, you'll go to war... alongside Block and his army. Your nature could easily allow there to be two of you."
542678, "Don't bring that up again! I'm not the plague!"
542679, "You're talking about spiritual grace, right? Whereas I'm talking about myself."
542680, "Well then... This is how I see it. We will be vigilant at all times. As soon as there's a new outbreak somewhere, we will board up that house at once-or that district, if need be; thankfully it can be done, given the peculiar town planning here... My master did that five years ago. You will immediately pick someone from among your Bound and-"
542681, "What if they refuse to become a donor?"
542683, "I wasn't referring to that."
542684, "What, then? What's your take on all this?"
542685, "They won't. Once they've given consent, they'll stay true to their word. Or else our being Bound would amount to nothing."
542686, "So you think all I have to do is just lay my hands on them once, and it will be done?"
542687, "How long will one person last us?"
542688, "I don't know... Possibly forever. It's said that the town's survival hinges on the seven righteous ones. You said yourself that seven would be enough."
542689, "So you think all I have to do is just lay my hands on them once, and it will be done?"
542690, "I don't think once will be enough. And you'll have to do it in public, to avoid rumours and speculations. At any rate, I'll make the extracts and see what happens. We'll try this and that."
542691, "Ugh! That sounds a bit too... mechanical, for lack of a better word..."
542692, "All right, Stakh. I've understood your plan. You're going to have to be the last in that chain."
542693, "Your role in this is a mechanical one. Ask the masked Executors. They're already excitedly sharing details with each other."
542694, "What's that supposed to mean? My 'role'? What role?"
542695, "I'd like to avoid that. Miracles and mechanics don't mix very well, do they?"
542696, "I don't know. That's up to you."
542697, "Yes, it's up to me... And that points my thoughts in a certain direction..."
542698, "...So we've gone full circle?"
542700, "So that was the easiest option?"
542701, "Yes, it was perhaps... the simplest solution. And the most emotional one, behind its veneer of calculation. Three deceptions, one after another... gradual disillusionment, bitterness, a desire to retaliate against the oppressors... predictable obstinacry and a contrarian decision."
542702, "Does he at least have a chance to defeat you?"
542703, "Depends on what he's understood, doesn't it? Surely you two have had a conversation aready. How profoundly has he been enlightened, this sophisticated gentleman?"
542704, "'He seems to have found a way into the Focus and realized he was a toy."
542705, "I don't know."
542706, "Then ask. He's at his usual place."
542707, "All right. I'll ask. And then I'll make you sorry for abusing the rules."
542708, "Ah... I see. He should better bring somebody else to the Cathedral then. As I've already said: his trajectory is so designed as to make it difficult for him to abandon his arrangement. Except by a lapse of judgement-but we're not concerned with that."
542709, "Indeed? And why the hell are you planning beforehand which decision will be free and which won't be? There's no escaping from this loop! So long as you're here, this will last forever."
542710, "That's why we initially planned pure destruction for our dearest Changeling. Which would obviously include our own destruction... You know all this philosophical stuff, don't you? The truth as liberation... ephemeral things... the wheel of rebirth..."
542711, "Nonsense. I don't believe in that."
542712, "That's fairly well-advised..."
542713, "That's nice to hear."
542714, "So what am I supposed to do?"
542715, "We surmise that this paradox can be resolved... but that's just a hypothesis. Hint: in your case only, out of the three. Why?"
542716, "I'll soon find the answer to this question."
542717, "Go to hell..."
542718, "So it was a kind of loop?"
542719, "Yes. The purest version of one, it seems. Two diverging pairs of decisions. Both pre-determined, but the dilemma is a harsh one indeed. That made the freedom all the more salient. And then, you see, there were also feelings involved... Love."
542720, "Does he at least have a chance to defeat you?"
542721, "Depends on what he's understood, doesn't it? Surely you two have had a conversation aready. How profoundly has he been enlightened, this great intuiter of things?"
542722, "He doesn't seem to have understood anything at all. Perhaps he doesn't even care. He thinks himself a hero."
542723, "Ah... I see. Then it would be better if he waived the choice altogether. That would at least be unexpected. Seems daft, doesn't it? But it's not that simple... The Haruspex is a man of action, and-"
542724, "Indeed? And why the hell are you planning beforehand which decision will be free and which won't be? There's no escaping from this loop! So long as you're here, this will last forever."
542725, "That's why we initially planned pure destruction for our dearest Changeling. Which would obviously include our own destruction... You know all this philosophical stuff, don't you? The truth as liberation... ephemeral things... the wheel of rebirth..."
542726, "Nonsense. I don't believe in that."
542727, "That's nice to hear."
542728, "So what am I supposed to do?"
542729, "We surmise that this paradox can be resolved... but that's just a hypothesis. Hint: in your case only, out of the three. Why?"
542730, "I'll soon find the answer to this question."
542731, "Go to hell..."
542732, "That's fairly well-advised..."
542733, "I don't know."
542734, "Then ask. He's at his usual place."
542735, "All right. I'll ask. And then I'll make you sorry for abusing the rules."
542736, "Of a surrogate kind, right?"
542737, "Love can't be surrogate. It's either there or it isn't."
542738, "Don't try to be smart here. I'm the expert in love, not you..."
542739, "Well, no one's taking that gift away from our dearest Clara..."
542740, "I'd still like a hint. If this is the situation with my invariant, then how am I different?"
542741, "Now then, what have you understood, sweetie?"
542742, "It's all been clear to me for quite a while. I know there's no one here except me and you, and that you left this place a long time ago. That which is talking to me is your pitiful residue."
542743, "Whoa. Since then have we been on such familiar terms?"
542744, "We were talking to the Changeling. Ignore that. We're assuming you couldn't possibly have asked such a question."
542745, "Why, what if I did?"
542746, "Ah... Point taken."
542747, "Come now... What makes you say that? We have after all kept ourselves a function and not a constant..."
542748, "Don't try to be smart. I don't understand such words."
542749, "Still the Changeling? That deeply immersed in the character...?"
542750, "I was joking."
542751, "I'm waiting for more."
542752, "Speak to my colleague. He's your invariant. Yours, not the Changeling's."
542753, "I want to know what kind of a miracle I can perform myself! You swear it's genuine, right?"
542754, "...Shall we tell you? Brace yourself! We're going to actually tell you!"
542755, "Yes, tell me."
542756, "Stop! Don't. Anything but that."
542757, "Go ahead and tell me you didn't plan anything at all for me. Scumbags..."
542758, "Well... initially, we were going to rest content with just the destruction, but then we quickly slapped together a different ending... which had this sacrificial miracle in it. On the whole, though, we didn't really plan anything, to be honest. There just wasn't enough time to think it through."
542759, "...You guessed?"
542760, "I guessed."
542761, "No. What did you have in store for me? What's my ending?"
542762, "Fantastic. Now be quiet, I know where I'm going next."
542763, "So is the plague an evil or a blessing?"
542764, "Oh, that's up to you to decide."
542765, "Or was I that blessed divine messenger precisely when I was spreading the plague with my hands? Was I doing His will?"
542766, "Whose will? That's the principal question. I'm still losing the thread and don't know who I'm talking to."
542767, "Can a miracle be performed under such conditions?"
542768, "And why are you still here? Have you been left behind or something?"
542769, "Why are you here? Go away... I'm scared! You're scary."
542770, "Scared? Why are you scared, little girl? What did you say your name was?"
542771, "I've come to play with you a little before I go..."
542772, "Oh... Thrush."
542773, "Is it derived from 'thrust', as in into the ground, or 'crush', as in in the process?"
542774, "Hey! Don't say that... it's scary!They took the coffin this morning and drove away with it! It's not coming back! Ever! No one is going to thrust anything anywhere!"
542775, "Thrush... See, that's a very fitting name. Did you make it up for the game?"
542776, "Uh-huh... So that I don't catch the disease."
542777, "So you're afraid of a play-disease? How could you possibly catch it?"
542778, "Anything can happen... One doesn't trifle with such things, you know. Sometimes it's all fun and games till it happens for real. That's what I keep telling Measly but he wouldn't listen..."
542779, "Ah, so we're being sensitive now... If you're afraid of a coffin, why play a game like this? Well, whatever; I don't suppose there's a point in talking to you..."
542780, "I want to go home! Let me go, I want to go home!"
542781, "How old are you, child?"
542782, "I don't know... Not old. And you may be a great big dummy but we're still the same height!"
542783, "It's because I'm hunkering. That's why we're the same height. See?"
542784, "Want to know who's the great big dummy here? Look in the mirror."
542785, "So you're back from a funeral... By the way, you can tell me who it is you've lost."
542786, "You don't have to wait long, little toy. Hang in there, I'll release you soon."
542787, "Well, he's picked himself quite a witching name too."
542788, "Just in case!"
542789, "How old are you, child?"
542790, "Well, you know... just to see if you say anything interesting. But now I see you're just playing around in here."
542791, "No, little boy... I'm not Clara."
542792, "A high flying bird you've become./n/nThe Executors are watching you, barely able to hide a smile... and I don't like their smirks one bit. Soon enough you are going to see that they were not smiling because they were happy for you./n/nBeware, if you may, we were both trapped. Each one of us has suffered a tailor-made deception. They say you are not like me, and this is not something I would argue with. Moreover, I've just found out something utterly ridiculous about myself. Hopefully, your fate will not be a reiteration of my own./n/nBe very careful, anyway. Self-assurance is your worst enemy. I've learned of at least one way to achieve victory. Perhaps it may work well enough for you./n/nCome see me if you will. Give me the benefit of doubt, so to speak./n/nD. D. D."
542793, "The Bachelor says Goodbye"
542794, "What do you want?"
542795, "Well, enough idle blather. Since you've already turned up and made a farce out of this Council, decide quickly, and let's be done with it. We're not going to hear anything worthwhile here."
542796, "What, are you jealous? You do realize you're not the centre of the universe, I hope?"
542797, "Yes... I don't like ceremony and circumlocution either."
542798, "That was gruff... Well, it is the twelfth day... Don't you want to tell me something?"
542799, "No."
542800, "This is embarrassing. Why aren't you directing the conversation anymore? Dominating it?"
542801, "What would be the point? You're not part of my plans."
542802, "Just wanted to have a final talk with you... Before the Council begins. To extend a hand, if you like."
542803, "Please explain. You've found room for everyone in your plans, but not me?"
542804, "Something like that. Both the Bachelor and the Haruspex are of this world, and you aren't. You're a foreign body, a demon pretending to be human. They're people of the same flesh and blood as myself; you're a thing that comes in the dark. They aren't demons. You are."
542805, "So you've placed your bets on these two? Perhaps both at once?"
542806, "...Those aren't words to be thrown around lightly. How will you prove it?"
542807, "So what now Inquisitor? Are you going to burn me at the stake? Will you even be able to?"
542808, "I won't... I'm no longer able to do anything at this point."
542809, "Which part is unclear to you?"
542810, "I'd like to hear your advice. Who knows, maybe I'll follow it."
542811, "Any final behests, maybe? How am I to act? How do I win? Maybe I'll heed you, who knows..."
542812, "I've already told you. Step aside. Get out of this world. That's the best solution for you."
542813, "Why do you detest me so much?"
542814, "You've joined forces with the Commander. I can predict the consequences of your alliance. You being a fanatic and visionary-moreover, in the guise of a prophetess possessed by the Holy Spirit-he'll certainly acquiesce to you and will end up completely under your control."
542815, "Are you saying this on purpose to make me strengthen that alliance just to spite you?"
542816, "The Commander is the lowliest of you all. Not just a puppet but a double puppet. Or a triple one. That's why I can relate to him so well."
542817, "No. And I'd generally advise you against calculations like these. I'll always be a step ahead of you there."
542818, "Could be, could be... All right, goodbye. See you at the Council."
542819, "Sorry to say we probably aren't going to reconcile our differences."
542820, "What sort of an impudent hint was that?"
542821, "It wasn't. I didn't quite mean to say it."
542822, "He who has ears, let him hear."
542823, "That something is more of a someone, I suppose?"
542824, "No it isn't. I meant exactly what I said."
542825, "Ah, the arrogance. And here I hoped you'd have the inner strength to love them as thyself."
542826, "I feel nothing but loathing towards myself too."
542827, "Yes, certainly. Thank you."
542828, "Not nine but seven, to be exact. Nine were invited, seven were chosen. Nine sinners, seven transformed."
542829, "Not much of a relief, that. Everyone else gets decent confidants, and I..."
542830, "Sinners? Them? What are you talking about!"
542831, "No, no. I do love them... I feel sorry for them."
542832, "Still, rules are rules. You won't get around this law no matter how hard you try. Not that you need this kind of petty self-assertion in the first place."
542833, "All right. I'll be back soon."
542834, "Why not? If I can defeat the Law, it means the Law has no power over me-right?"
542835, "Let's not get mired in theorizing. That would be inane. I could tell you that some forces cannot be defeated without yielding to them first... but let's skip the poetry. You're not going to sway me. The town shall not be spared but for the sake of seven righteous people."
542836, "That's hypocrisy, plain and simple."
542837, "Why, isn't it seven already?"
542838, "No. Not yet. You can take a nap across the street for now. The Crucible is no longer a threat to you. Perhaps you'll even dream of something unusual..."
542839, "I don't think so. Admit it, you'd be glad if I overslept and missed the Council, wouldn't you?"
542840, "I don't feel like it for some reason."
542841, "What does it matter? Do whatever you please; it's not like it will change anything. Go ahead and oversleep. Or die in your sleep as a parting gesture. It's all up to you now."
542842, "Are you trying to flatter me?"
542843, "*** Let her remain inside! Hopefully, she won't be going anywhere now... I wonder what those who remain faithful to her cause would say..."
542844, "I want to get inside right now. But you're not going to let me in, right?"
542845, "You buffoon... It's not like I have other options! I'll have to-sooner or later."
542846, "They can, they very much can... In your case, if I'm not mistaken, everyone can make it through. This is one of the brighter aspects of your great mission. A pleasant bonus, if you will."
542847, "What about Eva though? And the Olgimskys...?"
542848, "Do you think this is funny?"
542849, "Yes, Eva, the Olgimskys, the Foreman of the Abattoir, all of them. But be quick. There's a reason you've come here, isn't there? You wanted to talk?"
542850, "Yes, I was going to ask a few questions. All right, I'll try to save everyone. It seems I'm destined for this... being the saviour of assorted nobodies."
542851, "In fact I just wanted to say how deeply disappointed I am... if not to say disgusted. I suppose you'll eventually pass it on to those on the inside."
542852, "Eventual passing-on is always a certainty."
542853, "That came out sinister. I could do without being reminded."
542854, "Thank you."
542855, "Then wait a little more."
542856, "We can wait, but time won't. It's the only thing that's truly out of our control. That was a hint, by the way."
542857, "Thank you. I'll ponder over it on my way."
542858, "Granddad... Our dear Granddad has died!"
542859, "I'm sorry."
542860, "Your grandfather hasn't died. He's merely moved on to the afterlife. Don't cry."
542861, "I was imagining something more horrible."
542862, "Of course it isn't. Don't cry."
542863, "What kind of a question is that?"
542864, "Uh-oh... You're not going to... hurt us, are you? I just asked because I was curious..."
542865, "There, there. Why would I hurt sad little things like you..."
542866, "Not anymore. I've changed. Now I'm a real miracle-worker."
542867, "Then we've got to go home too. Was this a good game? What do you think?"
542868, "Passable..."
542869, "Horrible! Your game is simply atrocious."
542870, "Actually, it wasn't your game, kid."
542871, "If you like, you can ask us questions and we'll answer. The ones who were here before you here loved asking us questions! And we didn't mind. We'll give great answers, explaining everything and all. Look, this here, with the holed pebbles, is the Abattoir. And that over there-can you imagine?-is the Polyhedron!"
542872, "You know what-how about you told me instead who your favourites are?"
542873, "That's cute. Do you even realize that you're in there, on the inside?"
542874, "Favourites? Mine is this, you know, this-Foreman! The great big one! That's who I like the most. The Haruspex is all right too... I always want to know which of them wins the fight in the end. And Thrush loves Lara, that doll over there..."
542875, "Why?"
542876, "No, I was asking about us, the protagonists."
542877, "Do you want me to tell you honestly or dishonestly?"
542878, "Honestly."
542879, "Well... we don't particularly like you. You're weird. The Bachelor, that one's all right. Except it's a shame he's got that suitcase completely attached to him. I wonder if I should tear it off."
542880, "Don't. He won't be able to do his work then."
542881, "Pity you don't like me... Eh well, I can't make you."
542882, "Dishonestly."
542883, "Then-you, of course!"
542884, "You're funny, Measly. Now, off you go home."
542885, "I don't get it either. She just does."
542886, "Are you even capable of love?"
542887, "Go home, kids. There's nothing for you to do here anymore. The game is over."
542888, "Yes, we are. And you?"
542889, "Of course."
542890, "No. I'm not."
542891, "I don't know."
542892, "So you're leaving the decision to me?"
542893, "Yes. I am. Why would I have brought you here otherwise?"
542894, "But what's the point? Do tell me. And be careful! A lot will depend on your answer."
542895, "The point is that in this case, the winner will be-"
542896, "...Love, right?"
542897, "...No. Mere humanity. Any kind of it-even malicious, and yet still a living one. We win and you lose here, you see?"
542899, "You're wrong. Go, there's your Eva, crying by the railing. You'll be the only one who sees her."
542900, "A good answer. Thank you."
542901, "You know, I really couldn't care less. As far as I'm concerned, you understand less about sacrificial victims than the Bachelor does about mirror towers."
542902, "You've disappointed me, Haruspex. I didn't expect such pettiness from you."
542903, "All right. Let's not argue in here. Will you let me decide?"
542904, "I will. I like your decision."
542905, "You know, I've seen all of this already! So what's the difference? Nothing's changed!"
542906, "If you really think so, step aside. Let me make the decision. If you don't understand anything, then mine and the Bachelor's decisions are inherently better than yours. And mine is, of course, better than the Bachelor's."
542907, "Why so?"
542908, "There's more feeling in it."
542909, "No. Not more. Just as much, or as little."
542910, "It's because your confidants are children. I wish mine were like that..."
542911, "Yes. And so, hopefully, will I."
542912, "Farewell, my general. This is truly the end. Our time is up."
542913, "Don't worry, my general. I know how much you value clarity."
542914, "What if I said no?"
542915, "I've made up my own mind. If your answer is no, I'll find a way to reconcile myself with that. Perhaps after a while I'll realize what I don't realize now."
542916, "Now you've surprised me too. Imagine that! I was almost thinking-"
542917, "No. I know all that already."
542918, "So be it then."
542919, "And you're aware of how it's going to be implemented?"
542920, "I don't need to be. Because I trust you."
542921, "So shall it be then."
542922, "Make your own choice, Commander. You are free."
542923, "You're intending to go back to the frontline, aren't you?"
542924, "I've trusted you... and I'm not going back on that trust."
542925, "Nothing."
542926, "Would you like to talk to the Haruspex?"
542927, "No. I don't. I'll do as you say, and I need no one else's advice. Do you definitely believe that this is what must be done?"
542928, "What are you talking about?"
542929, "Will you leave this place with me?"
542930, "Of course! Where am I to be now if not on the battlefield."
542931, "No, my general. I will have to remain here forever. Otherwise, how am I to transform my Bound?"
542932, "Exactly. I'm glad you feel the same way as I do. You will help me take power in the country. My army will be at your disposal. Make us a tool in His spear-hand."
542933, "I'm not asking you to think it over-such decisions are better left to the heart. Instead of nursing a single town for the remainder of your days, you could turn the entire country to the true faith. Our entire star-crossed, long-suffering land."
542934, "No, no... I'm not up to a task like this! How could I ever be?"
542935, "Who is up to it if not you? Who will do away with the unjust rulers? Who will stop the war? Who will put an end to the suffering of the poor? The moment is right. It is at times like these, ridden with strife and turmoil, with no end to adversity in sight, that true power breaks free. My regiments can turn the tide. And I will not allow a lawless tyranny!"
542936, "O, how mistaken you are!"
542937, "True... You must be right..."
542938, "Your virtue will vouch for this!"
542939, "Don't tempt me, my general. This path is not for me."
542940, "How can you not understand... You're living a dream. All of this is a mere haze. You came out of thin air and you'll pass into nothingness."
542941, "Yes... You have a firm hand."
542942, "Is that what you think?"
542943, "I feel I must do what must be done here. If it is necessary that we are rejoined, we will be when the time is ripe."
542944, "To me, you look like a body with its soul taken out. A thing that looks and acts human-but isn't!"
542945, "And in the meantime, I've realized what my mission is..."
542946, "Yes, do tell me, please, it's very interesting. How did you wriggle out of that trap?"
542947, "I didn't. I'm a hero. Better to be a trapped hero than a free cripple, isn't it?"
542948, "The town will suffer..."
542949, "The town is an instrument. It was made for humans, not the other way round."
542950, "But you're not human!"
542951, "You're forgetting about freedom. All that's happening here is happening for your freedom's sake. Do you understand?"
542952, "I must admit I'm a bit confused-but it was for the better. It allowed me to escape the iron grip of my preordainment. I'm content with being able to choose with my heart."
542953, "The creators of this dilemma had limited your choice to two options..."
542954, "I'm content with as much regardless. If you give me a chance to choose, you can be sure I'll choose the most humane solution. The most human one."
542955, "Oh really? The Bachelor at least figured out he was a puppet."
542956, "I'm not a toy, Changeling. I am Artemy Burakh, a Haruspex who knows the lines, a Warden who has fulfilled his mission and reconciled his father's spirit with the Earth, and has made the correct choice. That's who I am. Do you understand?"
542957, "Are you at least aware that you're a mere toy?"
542958, "And I'm not a puppet. Must be because I never figured it out... What else do you plan on surprising me with?"
542959, "Do you really not care?"
542960, "So you're a believer in salvation through ignorance?"
542961, "No. I don't. But you do seem to have got it mixed up. You think, don't you, that what happened here was all on your account? Yes, you're confused... But then allow me to take charge. Tell the Commander. He listens to you with rapt attention. He wouldn't even bother listening to me."
542962, "You can be persuasive... Perhaps you are right after all..."
542963, "No, Haruspex. That's not going to happen."
542964, "Who, you? But you are nothing!"
542965, "What makes you think so? I'm as human as they come, and no amount of your insults will change that."
542966, "Wait... I think I'm beginning to understand you... And now... yes, now I see that you're closer to victory than me..."
542967, "You're a demon!"
542968, "Why?"
542969, "Because your nature is different. You're a golem without a soul-or more exactly, with a borrowed soul!"
542970, "That's where you're wrong. If nothing else, I'm definitely not lacking in the immortal soul department. Rather, it's my soul that some people wouldn't stop trying to borrow, as they seek to control me. Try telling them to their faces about their demonic nature..."
542971, "You're wise! So you do know how to win? Aglaya was right..."
542972, "That last part sounded oddly covetous."
542973, "Could be... I'm not the one without sin here. That would be you."
542974, "That's no laughing matter. You wouldn't understand anyway... "
542975, "I'm more than a plaything, Bachelor."
542976, "Of course not... For the town's sake."
542977, "There are no bachelors and no towns here, blind man! There's just you and I. And you are my past. Meaning that, technically, there's just me and I."
542978, "Then the I that's me is the better one."
542979, "No way, Bachelor."
542980, "As if anything could be apparent to you! You're a bodily frame devoid of soul and will; you're not capable of understanding a thing at this point."
542981, "Self-denial is the meaning here, silly. Deny yourself and you win. Yes, that's how it is! That's the essence of my discovery."
542982, "How banal! Even bordering on trite, don't you think?"
542983, "Don't rush to conclusions. I'm on the verge of making my final discovery. In a nutshell, I feel I've been imbued with more meaning than is apparent to me."
542984, "There are no bachelors and no towns here, blind man! There's just you and I. And you are my future that I don't even want to happen. It's dull."
542985, "Too convoluted, Bachelor. You're that learned fool from vulgar comedies. Try repeating all of that in Latin; you might bring down the house. Goodbye."
542986, "It was for you. You think that because your nature is evil. It's only fitting that you should reject it."
542987, "You don't say!"
542988, "I've always sensed it in you. At first I thought you were a demon, because you weren't like them, with a power of a different kind growling inside you-now I see why it seemed that way!"
542989, "Isn't that also the essence of your supposed miracle? Assuming, of course, that Rubin described it to me accurately."
542990, "I can make any miracle happen, Bachelor. That is my essence."
542991, "No, Bachelor. It's not that. Goodbye."
542992, "You're possessed with pride."
542993, "Not at all. Actually I realize that you're closer to victory than me. See, I've had the humility to admit the greatness of your feat. After all, unlike me, you had no predisposition for it..."
542994, "Not at all. I'm merely aware of my responsibility and have no intention of disowning my power. There's a greater pride in humility-haven't you ever heard that adage? Goodbye. You're getting nothing."
542996, "Ira furor brevis est."
542997, "Ignorantia non est argumentum. "
542998, "Duo bus certantibus tertius gaudet."
543001, "Felix, qui potuti rerum cogoscere causas..."
543002, "I understand now! It was she; she stole your soul from me! She's already visited you, didn't she? Didn't she?"
543003, "Heads are going to fall like no tomorrow. I know how Inquisitors work. Karminsky is a real ghoul... and a shrewd one; there's no hiding anything from him. No. I'll try to forestall him. Perhaps... yes, perhaps it will even be a winning gambit!"
543004, "Wait... What are you doing? Don't!"
543005, "You want to try and hide from the all-seeing eye?"
543006, "There's one place I can actually hide from him. I'll go to the Termitary. They're awaiting we there. The Mother Superior is stamping her little foot impatiently!"
543007, "She'll... she'll have you killed!"
543008, "I understand now... She's beaten me to it again. Always a step ahead of me!"
543009, "I've been looking for my sister."
543010, "Not now."
543011, "You don't have to say anything."
543012, "Sore, oh how sore I am... My throat and my eyes are burning with sand, the ground underneath me is crumbling. ...I'd give anything for a drop of water."
543014, "What on earth could you offer in exchange? Don't come near me. "
543015, "Why don't you get some yourself? You can find a bottle in any bin, and there's a water-barrel's just around the corner."
543016, "My ears are abuzz, I'm so short of breath. It's twyre that's sucking me dry. ...And who knows if the water in that barrel is fine to drink anyway? Terrible things are happening all around. Have you heard about last night?"
543017, "No. What happened? "
543018, "No, and I have no desire to. Be on your way, I don't want to talk to you."
543019, "They say last night Simon Kain died. Nobody knows how it happened, but the main suspect is Artemy Burakh. And he killed his father too. "
543020, "The two of them-first the Haruspex, then the Bachelor-will drown the town in blood."
543021, "I don't believe it. The Warden is not a person to break the joint of time, he won't foul his hands with the blood of his kin. He has no reason to kill Simon, too."
543022, "So you're not allowed into shops? Or are you pressed for money?"
543023, "Have you seen the prices? I cannot even buy an empty bottle, my dear. If this goes on, it won't matter how much we've stockpiled."
543024, "You are not the type to stockpile anything in advance anyway. Can you at all remember where you were yesterday and what you saw there?"
543025, "You can drink from a spring. "
543026, "You can get water from a spring and purchase a bottle in a shop. "
543027, "Sorry, I have no water. "
543028, "Oh, I wouldn't make it to a shop. Rumour has it they're full of sweet nothing anyway. Should've hoarded all I need in advance... Eh... had I known where I would fall I wouldn't have come to that place at all."
543029, "Which in your case means you don’t belong anywhere."
543030, "The town will have more stockpiles and hoards than people soon."
543031, "Hey, hey there... get your little hands away from me! You're clapping dish at the wrong man's door, I know your type!"
543032, "The salvation of this town is in my hands. Be on your way, you poor soul. Perhaps you will be saved after all."
543033, "You think I'd waste my time on a petty nobody like you?"
543034, "Can't you find a bottle in the street? As for water, you can get it over there, from a barrel."
543035, "Tumultuous and a-rumble is the town; and people wrap themselves to hide the face in dirty, ghastly rags. ...And you, girl, have you tried twyrine? They say it offers good disease protection."
543036, "Everyone will get infected sooner of later. Twyrine won't help you with this. "
543037, "Every bullet finds its billet. How about we barter?"
543041, "I've always said that shit tends to happen in the fall. A sordid time-and dirty, too. All muddy."
543042, "As for me, I like fall. The air is so transparent and everything's chiming and singing and glass-like."
543043, "Is summer better? It's not about the season."
543044, "What is there to complain about then?"
543046, "There's not a single bite to eat. Folks are dying. Who could have thought it would turn out like this for Simon, eh? Eh heh heh... Everyone's reduced to a pulp, but here we go again. Shutting people in-is that their idea of how things are done? They're working men, you know, they're not cattle!"
543047, "Is the Termitary still closed? What's it like in there?"
543048, "It's painful to even think about."
543049, "Keep your problems to yourself, will you?"
543050, "In all honesty, they don't look like men, even working class men. You at least are capable of human speech."
543051, "Hmm... Here I am, talking to you, and I'm starting to get shivers. What if you're the mara everyone's looking for? Look at you with your hands folded and all-what if you turn your head a bit and your face is all twigs? You don't care about people. You're full of spite. I, for one, am going to keep an eye on you so that you wouldn't follow me anywhere."
543052, "There's a community there, everybody knows that. So sometimes 'tis hard to make sense of them. Hopefully they won't start eating one another... 'cause there's not a crumb there otherwise. How long will they last? Their only hope's the Superior's daughter. They value her words, like, for real. Perhaps 'tis their salvation."
543053, "Say they unlock the Termitary. What if it's infected? That means hundreds of sick men crazed with pain will pour into the streets. A horrible thought!"
543054, "Shut up! "
543055, "Yes, everything's bad. And it keeps breaking. Will you fix it?"
543056, "Why are you always groaning? Be on your way. "
543057, "Fall is a very fitting season for everything that's happening here."
543058, "Keep clear of the marsh, it's putrid-just like the last time. I've told an outsider doc about a mate of mine already; a shabnak got him by the leg-and it snapped in half that instant."
543059, "I don't care about your friends. I'm in a hurry."
543060, "This time it will be more than just legs."
543061, "Thank you very much. I'll do my best to avoid it."
543062, "Yeah, sure. Fix this. And yeah, everything's sordid."
543063, "What else has happened, grampa?"
543064, "It's bad enough without you groaning."
543065, "Tell me, dear, how is it that all the factory workers are supposed to get it all for free, but we didn’t get a thing? Are we not good enough? Are we second-rate people? 'Tis my firm belief that if everyone is supposed to get it, then everyone should!"
543066, "What are you supposed to get? From where? Most importantly, what does it have to do with me? I'm not giving away anything."
543067, "What are you talking about? "
543068, "I can't understand a thing you're saying."
543069, "Protective clothes, boots, and so on. Boots are essential. They say the disease comes from the ground, it's the shabnak rising. And it's true."
543070, "Sorry, I know nothing about it. But I don't think this kind of protection will help."
543071, "You are a bore."
543072, "Where is everybody? Both Dogheads and Soul-and-a-Halves were here just a sec ago. Did you scare them off? Hey, don't you come closer!"
543073, "And hello to you too. So you are a tough guy, aren't you? Well, how's it going?"
543074, "What are you talking about? There was no one around."
543075, "If everyone's run away, how about we barter?"
543076, "Yesterday a shmowder cache was plundered, heard about that? And the formula's irretrievable! The only thing we can do is search for the ones that are still left. Geddit? Or maybe you were by the Mild Dew yesterday too?"
543077, "I'd rather take a look at what you have. Perhaps it was you there yesterday, not me? Let's check!"
543078, "Beware! You won't be able to get away from me next time."
543079, "What are you implying?"
543080, "Someone wanted shmowders real bad. That means soon everybody will. That's what I think. Why would anyone need shmowders otherwise?"
543081, "I don't understand you at all. "
543082, "Aren't you a bit too young to become a prophet? Why are you so sure anyone would want your 'shmowders'?"
543083, "Shmowders can cure you for real! We've tested them ourselves, actually. And they worked! Yeah!"
543084, "Where can one get hold of them now? "
543085, "I don't need medicine or drugs to cure."
543086, "Lika the traitor's played a dirty trick on us all. He's likely to have one though. But the thieves and the Dogheads and the Soul-and-a-Halves-everyone's after him. They'll tear him to pieces-and good riddance, too!"
543087, "I see that you are a bloodthirsty man."
543088, "Who knows-perhaps none of the three parties catches him."
543090, "I'll tear you to pieces if I get my hands on you! Just you wait!"
543092, "So what about you? You're a brave guy, right? Or a mad one? Fill me in on the news."
543095, "It's no point going to the shops now. Yeah. We'd rather search the warehouses for food. Gotta do the job tonight. And don't you even think about telling on us, you hear me? Or else!"
543096, "You shouldn't walk around the town at night. Anything can happen, you know."
543098, "The prices will fall when there's nobody around to eat."
543099, "Like I would waste my time on you. Get lost!"
543100, "Do you have anything new? Shall we trade? "
543101, "What's the news?"
543102, "I have bartered a hook and three nuts today. The kiddos will be green with envy. Gave out three rifle rounds for them. Oh, if only I had a rifle! I'd so..."
543103, "Not bad."
543104, "And what would you do?"
543105, "They'd be afraid to even come close to me! I can do without a rifle too! But bare fists are not enough when it's one against four... And father says there are... mafrauders now burgling abandoned houses-but they can break into ours too. And so I'd go-bang! In your face! They'd never try it again!"
543106, "Aren't you a hero. But my advice would be to avoid marauders. Even patrolmen can't always deal with them."
543107, "Run home, will you? What if 'mafrauders' come and you're not there?"
543108, "What's the news on the street? Seen anything worthwhile?"
543109, "Rumour has it, everyone who fights or just hangs around at night is a bandit. And what are we supposed to do, huh? If anyone lays a finger on me or one of my lot, they'll pay for it-and to hell with the new rules!"
543110, "Don't be so angry. Strength is not about fists."
543111, "When rage and fear fill the town, you will only find salvation within yourself. Let those who are dear to you into your soul. "
543113, "But what about medicine? We've searched every nook and cranny for shmowders. I wanted to get one for Dina. Just in case..."
543114, "Dinka will be fine. I know for sure. Everything will be fine, actually. You... You'd better take care of yourself... "
543116, "Medicine is of no use. It just burns your entrails rather than save you. "
543117, "How are you? What's up?"
543118, "Clara, something's looking for you... or someone... Anyway, Sticky's been tracking it, but he failed. And he's very good at this. A creepy creature."
543119, "Do not worry about me. And thank you. "
543120, "What does it look like? "
543121, "I know. But who knows who is looking for whom and who finds whom first."
543122, "Like nothing I've ever seen! 'Cause I haven't seen it. 'Cause it was Sticky tracking it, not me, I'm telling you."
543123, "Why are you calling it creepy then? You haven't seen it!"
543124, "It's for the better that you haven't seen it. You don't need to."
543125, "Well, you have come close to me already, so let's barter."
543126, "I suggest you follow their example. "
543127, "What's news? Still up to no good?"
543128, "You said you can heal with your hands. Is it for real? If one of my mates falls sick, will you help? Everyone's scared of you now, they say coming close to you is bad and dangerous and... Were you in the Cathedral yesterday?"
543129, "What are you talking about? Don't parrot nonsense. You have come close to me, haven't you? So what?"
543130, "So don't you come close! How's you blood, is it running cold already?"
543131, "I was in the Cathedral. But that's not why they got infected. Do you believe me? "
543132, "I believe it wasn't you. Capella says so too-and she knows stuff. Too bad the Cathedral was hosting the hospital. My ma was there, and now they say they won't let her out, and I'm not allowed in."
543133, "I'm very sorry. I wish I could help. "
543134, "Any more news? Have you seen the creature that's been looking for me lately?"
543135, "I don't have time to deal with your problems. "
543136, "Sticky says it's made of clay and bones. He followed it, but it disappeared into the Steppe. Ask Grace. Also someone's buying all the vitamins from us-and it takes like a kilo of them to be of any use."
543137, "Into the Steppe, you say... All right. I'll check it out. Thank you! "
543138, "I think I have an idea of who it might be."
543139, "How's it going? What's the news? "
543140, "Do you think the Bachelor would give me a vaccine if I asked him, eh? He must have some. He used to test drugs in the Mouth and had some business with Rubin later. But we couldn't get a closer look back then."
543141, "Even if his vaccine saves you, it'll take your soul away. "
543142, "They failed miserably. They have no idea what they're up against!"
543143, "You'd better ask Rubin. He could help. "
543144, "Yeah right, like I can ask him... He's a wanted man, thanks to the Kains-they're like mad dogs on the loose, they have all their men search for him. It's not like I'm a better searching party!"
543145, "You are so in the loop it's uncanny."
543146, "Their vaccines are of no use anyway. You'll live longer without them."
543147, "Barter? That would help me a lot."
543148, "Got junk you don't need? Let's barter."
543149, "Well, you are the only fearless and smart person around. You'll just have to live with that."
543150, "I didn't see anyone. "
543151, "If I bring nothing home today, my family will either starve or die from the disease. Could you help me in any way? Please spare some coins so that I could get medicine at least, please! I'll spread the word of your kindness."
543152, "Soon neither you nor your family will need medicine. "
543153, "Take it then. I hope it helps."
543154, "I have nothing to give. I'm sorry."
543155, "How much is it? "
543156, "A hundred. That's enough to get medicine."
543157, "Five hundred. "
543158, "One thousand. "
543159, "Two thousand. "
543160, "Three thousand. "
543161, "Four thousand. Take care, do not lose it. "
543162, "You're not supposed to count gift money."
543163, "What's wrong with you?"
543164, "My arms and legs won't work properly, I've got fiery circles before my eyes. I feel hot, as though something was burning me from inside. I met a big-city doctor recently, he told me to lie down. But who's going to feed my family then?"
543165, "The Earth will eat all of you if you keep listening to him."
543166, "He is right, you should go home. I can't do anything for you now, and the streets will indeed do you no good."
543167, "It's all the same-you will all die. A day sooner or a day later, what does it matter?"
543168, "I doubt you'll make it. Trouble has already come to live in your house. "
543169, "I'll share what I can. But it will hardly help you, you look too bad. Well, at least you'll have a chance to save your family."
543170, "Aren't you a bit too picky?"
543171, "Are you sick or something? "
543172, "I have a fever, but it'll pass... The prices have risen tenfold. The water barrel by the Skinners got a leak... and the soil beneath it turned red. Nothing good will come of it."
543173, "How would you know what comes of what? Be off-who knows how much time you still have to stumble in my way."
543174, "Go home. Who knows how everything will turn out? We have to have faith while there still is at least a shred of hope left. "
543176, "How are you feeling now? "
543177, "I know I'm about to die. My bloodflow is slowing down, making the veins groan; my chest is on fire... We will all follow in the Ruler's footsteps. But even as we die, we won't be able to leave this place. We shall become the Sand Plague's body, its dead cells..."
543178, "You're right. You are all too keen; and so your end is nigh. "
543179, "Go home. Who knows how everything will turn out? We need to be patient-just a little longer."
543180, "My children, oh my poor little darlings... You make my heart bleed... What will become of you? Ah girl, you'll know what caring for your children is like when you grow up."
543181, "Please don't eat your heart out. What is to come, will come."
543182, "Could you mend my clothes please? See, it's all torn. "
543183, "Stop moaning and get busy! I need some sewing up done."
543184, "Caring for them is nothing compared to being scared for them."
543185, "Your moaning will help neither them nor you."
543186, "There will come a day when both you and they will be no more."
543187, "I've got a loose stitch. Will you mend it please? "
543188, "All things must pass. They just do. The only thing that matters is if they pass you by."
543189, "Why are you in so much pain?"
543190, "What about you personally? How's it going?"
543191, "Is it hard on you?"
543192, "We are all mere orphans without Simon. We have neither a true Mistress, nor a Ruler in the town. After all, Katerina is not Victoria. "
543193, "There are other forces that can save the town. "
543194, "Ill words yield ill circumstances. You'll call trouble upon your head. "
543195, "There's no point talking about it."
543196, "Simon's gone for good now. The body's gone. Or maybe he has simply gone somewhere on his own-people say all kinds of things... Perhaps the Immortal Man is still alive. He would have restored order."
543197, "'Order', pah. It's always about order with you."
543198, "I think even Simon would have been powerless to. And the most horrible is yet to come."
543199, "Couldn't be worse! Have you seen the prices? We've been told to burn everything, bury it, and wait for the fresh goods. They used the pest as a scarecrow, and now they're lining their pockets. What can we do? People are starving. Some of us can't trudge through a single day without food."
543200, "Everyone's staying in, too afraid to go outside. There are only couriers and patrolmen in the streets. And I hear someone crying constantly next door... It's all that big-city doctor, he brought it all on us. Why did he have to come? There's a quarantine now. And there won't be a train."
543201, "It's not just starvation. Twyre is in bloom and so the earth is spending its lifeforces elsewhere-instead of sharing with you."
543202, "I'm sorry. So, so sorry! If only I could save you all..."
543203, "There's no point complaining. Just accept the upcoming suffering. No one is to blame for it."
543204, "You ain't seen nothing yet. Your current blights will pale in comparison with what is to come."
543205, "It's the souls of the people that the Earth wouldn't accept. You poor soul-if you hear them, you will have no peace at all soon."
543206, "Isn't he the one who is maintaining the order you care about so much? Weren't you talking about it before? He will do it with an iron fist. And he'll destroy anything that doesn't fit his idea of order."
543207, "You think the local quacks are better? The Bachelor will crush everything that doesn't fit his idea of order, true, but the Haruspex will cut anything that is not his kin."
543208, "Do you have a needle and a thread? Please mend my clothes, I'll pay you. "
543209, "Hi there! Do you know how to play Reflections? You don't seem like an ordinary girl. I wonder what you'd look like coming out on the other side!"
543210, "Trade? I'm sure I have something you might like."
543211, "Wanna barter? See what I've got."
543212, "Do you have anything of interest? Shall we barter? Do take a look, perhaps you'll find a use for this thingie of mine?"
543213, "There is not a path in the world that would be unavailable to me. I shall penetrate the Polyhedron as well... in due time."
543214, "Hi! I remember you-I was just this high back then, and you were probably even smaller. Is something bothering you?"
543215, "Just consider the thing standing before you a Reflection of mine. And I myself am already far, far away."
543216, "Do you? Sorry, I can't remember at all... Say, how does a House of the Living work? I think Lara wants to found one... If I don't end up there, does that mean I'm dead?"
543219, "Go home! It's not safe outside."
543220, "No, it's vice versa; if you do end up there, you'll only get out feet first."
543221, "Why would you want to go to the House of the Living?"
543222, "I don't. If anything happens, we will all hide in the Polyhedron. Khan says it's the safest place in the world.  No adults allowed though."
543223, "Sounds like a good idea."
543225, "So how many of you are in there now?"
543226, "A lot. Yesterday the father of one of our guys was killed by the Station, and now the lad won't say a word. Khan says he's better off in the Tower; it lets you see those who are already gone."
543227, "Kaspar thinks he knows something that others don't?"
543228, "That poor fellow. Are you sure it wouldn't be better for him to go home? He has some family left, I hope?"
543230, "Khan wouldn't just offer random advice-he means it. Plus the lad's family has enough mouths to feed as it is. Ah, I have to go get the groceries! Ugh, what am I supposed to tell Mom? The prices are rising by the hour!"
543231, "People just got scared, is all. The freight train won't come, but, on the other hand, the population is diminishing, so it crosses out."
543232, "Trust me, if this town is to die at all-it is not to starve... not physically anyway."
543233, "Did you catch the Unseen cat?"
543234, "Are you making fun of me? It's fine, no hard feelings. You do very well know that there is no Unseen cat. That said though, your eyes sure do remind me of it. Are you a Soul-and-a-Half? But you don't have a pet..."
543235, "No, I only have one soul. I'm here to help."
543236, "It is beyond your abilities to comprehend me. We may very well meet again."
543237, "I invited the Bachelor to have a look at the Unseen cat, but I know he won't come. He doesn't seem to understand us at all. Is it true that he's very smart?"
543238, "Intelligence is relative. Often the voice of reason tangles the ways of fate, whereas the heart always leads you down the right path."
543239, "That big-city doctor will do a lot of damage! He can't see past his nose without a microscope. You'd be better off not talking to him at all."
543240, "Are you looking for something?"
543241, "Everyone's looking for shmowders. The lads found some in the Silly House, in the Crude Sprawl. But they're all 'dead'-and now no one seems to remember the correct recipes... All of our stashes are empty-weird, isn't it?"
543242, "Weird indeed. Why would anyone want those things? They do more harm than good anyway."
543243, "How is it possible that no one knows how to mix a proper shmowder anymore?"
543244, "Crowfoot used to make good shmowders... but he's gotten rusty. I mean, we used to mix anything we could find. I never tried the results, but some of us did-and they kicked the bucket. My beau promised to get me one if I ever need it."
543245, "Do you really want to take this risk? It can be poisonous..."
543246, "It's not medicine that cures, trust me."
543247, "Will you play with us?"
543248, "I'm in a terrible hurry, dear. Next time perhaps."
543249, "Of course. What are you playing today?"
543250, "How about we barter instead?"
543251, "Not now, darling. But soon I will."
543252, "Honey, I want you to know... We won't be able to play for quite some time."
543253, "Have you forgotten? It's autumn! And autumn is Underground Bonfire time. Ha ha... And Uncle Bachelor tried to tell a lie. He said he used to play it too."
543254, "He never lies, sunshine. Maybe it was a joke. That is exactly what's so horrifying about him: he doesn't recognize anything but the truth. And everything that sounds even remotely false, he exterminates. But hey, why am I saying this? You're too young to understand."
543255, "Aren't you afraid to play such a game?"
543256, "We'll play every game in the world very soon, you and I."
543257, "Don't talk to him. And don't listen to anything he says about me. You hear me? It's all lies."
543258, "So he won't be able to get into the Tower, right? What if he thinks that it's also a lie? I mean, he won't be able to see everything no matter how hard he tries, he's very much a grown-up already."
543259, "Hey, I underestimated you! No worries. I won't let anyone change anything around here. We'll play in the Polyhedron yet, I promise."
543260, "No, I'm brave! I fear nothing!"
543261, "Yes, my love, you are the bravest. Now go and play. I have a lot on my plate right now."
543262, "What's that on your little palms? Have you been playing in the mud? Found anything interesting? Something that may be of use to me, perhaps?"
543263, "Soon is a long time from now..."
543264, "Who knows? Turn that frown upside down, sunshine."
543265, "Promise me you won't be wandering around here for a couple of days, okay? Or better yet, go to the Tower. If you don't listen to me, something bad might happen."
543266, "That's it, I don't have time for this. Off you go, buddy."
543267, "You can't play because of that monster chasing you, right? Is it true that it's a maneater who is looking to eat you?"
543268, "Have you seen it as well?"
543269, "Repeat after me: there are no maneaters! It's just spooky tales."
543270, "What did I just say? Off you go!"
543271, "No, Sticky told me. What if it eats you? Will you then be stuck inside of it? Then we won't play for sure..."
543272, "I'll eat him! And I'll have a bite of you too if you keep getting in my way!"
543273, "Sticky! Well, if I find this boy...! And you-don't listen to idle nonsense... Do you really think there is a thing in the world that can eat me?"
543274, "Don't come near me, sunshine. I'm not feeling too good. Go home."
543275, "No."
543276, "Come on, trade with your friend Clara... Look what I've got!"
543277, "What's that in your eyes? Here, look at me..."
543278, "You said you'd play with me yet. And they say you'll be caught tomorrow. Did you tell me a lie then?"
543279, "What are talking about? If I hear that again, I'll grab you, cook you and give your legs to the odonghs!"
543280, "I've never lied to you, have I? And that means everything's going to be fine. Stop whining."
543281, "Sorry, sweetie, next time."
543282, "Yeah, well... You don't really look like you want to play today."
543283, "They said the Inquisitor would arrive and everything would be in the right order again. But instead came this lady. A bad lady! Dad went out yesterday and never came back. Mom is crying, she says we are all going to die soon. What's it like, Clara? And when will Dad come back?"
543284, "I'm sorry, darling, you won't see him for some time now."
543285, "You won't ever see him again. He's dead. And your mother is right, you will all be there one day."
543286, "I'll do my best to fix something at least, sweetie. The bad lady will pay for this. Now go back to your mom. I'll take care of you."
543287, "I know you. You're Clara. They also call you the Changeling."
543288, "Well, since we already know each other, how about we trade?"
543289, "Time will tell, pumpkin."
543290, "Aren't they waiting for you at home?"
543291, "I used to be allowed to play until late. We would all go to visit Grandpa. And now he's gone. They said it's for real. Gone completely! And there's nothing left, not even a smallest piece of him."
543292, "I have no idea why Simon was wasting his time on you. Didn't he have anything better to do?"
543293, "It's all right. Soon you'll be old enough to play in the Tower. You'll have your own games then."
543294, "Tell me about the 'Taglur'."
543295, "Hi there! Are you all right?"
543296, "It's a game about a circle! You join hands, and then again and again and again. Until the end."
543297, "End? What end?"
543298, "Never thought it was a children's game."
543299, "Until the circle closes. That's the end of the game."
543300, "Why did you ask then? Or do you mean the other game? I can't talk about that."
543301, "All right, bye, pumpkin. Good luck with your circle."
543302, "All right, so long, pumpkin. Good luck with your circle."
543303, "Bad child! You're useless..."
543304, "Don't bother me with your silliness."
543305, "General Ashes is coming tomorrow to grind us all to dust. That's what Daddy says."
543306, "As long as I'm here, everything will stay as it has always been, sunshine. Don't bother your pretty head with it."
543307, "Nonsense. Tell me something good for a change."
543310, "Well, it's good that we have the Bachelor. He's so scary he'll probably scare the general away!"
543311, "Only to abuse you himself. Don't even think about trusting that mendacious demon."
543312, "You're right, pumpkin. Even the scariest man can serve a good cause..."
543313, "Are you judging me? Or do you sympathize?"
543314, "Neither. Why would you need my sympathy? Or do you have something to be judged for?"
543315, "I simply don't have anything to say to you."
543316, "Aren't you cold? The weather is deceptive in fall."
543317, "If nothing makes you warm, then that means there's no warmth inside you."
543318, "It's all the same to me, be it sympathy or judgement. I can't even feel the cold."
543319, "I feel nothing. I'm empty inside, so what does it matter if it's hot or cold outside?"
543320, "If nothing makes you warm, then that means there's no warmth inside you."
543321, "Whatever."
543323, "I know the dance. When I dance, I exist. I offer my juices to the earth, luring twyre out of it. But after that, when twyre blooms, I don't get drunk with the odour."
543324, "You do make me feel empty."
543325, "So it's you who we owe the twyre blooming to? I don't know if you are to be thanked."
543326, "Find your own way. Perhaps you'll find yourself before it all ends."
543327, "Whatever."
543328, "Can I be of assistance?"
543329, "What could there be inside such a monstrosity? I find it unbelievable that it's still standing at all. I'd never let my children enter the damn thing. Ever."
543330, "You mean the Polyhedron? Why wouldn't you take the children's word for that? Are you so sure you're smarter than they are?"
543331, "I don't think they're going to ask for your permission. You can't prohibit dreams."
543332, "That's where children's dreams live. Perhaps yours is among them as well. Did you dream when you were a child?"
543333, "No wonder they call you deranged. What's next? Are you going to suggest we all fall on our knees and worship it or something?"
543334, "This is pointless. I'm not going to waste time bashing my head against a brick wall."
543335, "You're right about one thing-soon you will all be doing what I suggest you do."
543336, "No, thank you."
543337, "Good morals and luck are a great help in managing a small community without resorting to violence. Personal standing can work wonders."
543338, "Excuse me. I'm in a hurry. "
543339, "You should be listening more carefully. I like our town. We're all one big family. But sometimes I get the feeling that we're all controlled by an unseen power, our actions but fiction."
543340, "I don't think I can relate to that."
543341, "You're not far from the truth. "
543342, "I'm surprised by how calm you are. Borderline smug."
543343, "The vaccine is a protective agent. It's a weakened specimen of the disease that our body can fight off. After you've suffered through the process, the body becomes resistant to it."
543344, "And what if it falls? The Tower with its fragile stem, all those unnatural structures? I'd rather the working districts were fenced off."
543345, "But why do people hoard vaccine ampulas then? Something's not right here. "
543346, "We've only got experimental vaccine now. The body fights it for a while, but then it stops."
543347, "I've heard about it before, I think. So you believe in this panacea?"
543348, "You see, my father used to deliver mail. It's a huge risk. His health is badly damaged by the abundance of various chemicals. He's coughing blood and has a constant headache... He's been bed-ridden for two days in a row. I'm so worried about him!"
543349, "Hm. I see. So it provides permanent protection?"
543351, "Yeah, sure, I really hope it helps you."
543352, "So a working vaccine is coming soon?"
543353, "You're amazingly knowledgeable! Get lost, doll. You have no idea what you're talking about."
543354, "Salvation is not about vaccines."
543355, "Thanks. You're an invaluable source of information."
543357, "If you ever see the Bachelor, please kindly tell him it's rubbish. His facts and figures will save no one."
543358, "Forgive me, I did not know. I am truly sorry to hear that, but I still doubt the Bachelor's vaccine will help. It lacks a crucial component."
543359, "I am sorry... "
543360, "Many more will pass away before the solution is found."
543361, "I think it is highly unlikely. But you're entitled to your opinion, of course."
543362, "Don't you like the Polyhedron? "
543364, "No, of course I do! It's wonderful. But the more children gather there, the more anxious I feel. It's so shaky... And my girl is spending all her time there."
543365, "Do not worry, it is more stable than most buildings in this town. "
543366, "Rubbish! Relocate to a different place then."
543367, "*** Maria will not get this necklace."
543368, "*** I don't like her behaviour in the slightest. It's as if she is hiding something. Is she disillusioned? Did someone scare her? What is on my dear mother's mind? I am going to have to talk to her later."
543369, "*** There. Not a sign of Andrey. Not a trace of the body either. I wonder what I should do now?"
